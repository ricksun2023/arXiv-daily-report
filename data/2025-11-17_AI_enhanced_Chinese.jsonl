However, in real-world scenarios, databases probably face numerous adverse events. Quantifying the ability to cope with these events from a comprehensive perspective remains an open problem. We provide the definition of database resilience to describe its performance when facing adversity and propose ResBench, a benchmark for evaluating database resilience. This framework achieves automation, standardization, and visualization of the testing process through clear hierarchical decoupling. ResBench simulates adverse events and injects them during normal transaction processing, utilizing a module to gather multiple metrics for the evaluation model. We assess database resilience across eight dimensions: throughput, latency, stability, resistance, recovery, disturbance period, adaptation capability and metric deviation.

In particular, current architectures ignore KC, working on datasets that appear incomplete or fragmented, despite they actually contain valuable hidden knowledge. This limitation may cause wrong interpretations when these data are used as input for GML models.\n  This paper proposes an innovative architecture that integrates a KC phase into GDB-GML applications, demonstrating how revealing hidden knowledge can heavily impact datasets' behavior and metrics. For this purpose, we introduce scalable transitive relationships, which are links that propagate information over the network and modelled by a decay function, allowing a deterministic knowledge flows across multiple nodes.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that our intuition radically reshapes both topology and overall dataset dynamics, underscoring the need for this new GDB-GML architecture to produce better models and unlock the full potential of graph-based data analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684GDB-GML\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u56fe\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u8865\u5168\uff08KC\uff09\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u85cf\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u8fdb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u56fe\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9690\u85cf\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4GML\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06KC\u9636\u6bb5\u96c6\u6210\u5230GDB-GML\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f20\u9012\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8870\u51cf\u51fd\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u6d41\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u5851\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u91ca\u653e\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u6f5c\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple.

This paper asks a precise, testable version of the \"runaway growth\" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts.

A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u5730\u589e\u52a0\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\uff08\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ef4\u62a4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u81ea\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u6570\u5927\u4e8e\u7b49\u4e8e0\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "70\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u71b5\u4ece0.32\u589e\u52a0\u52301.69\uff0c\u800c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u770b\u4f5c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7ef4\u62a4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u81ea\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Multimodal recommendation systems, which leverage textual and visual data, offer a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, existing industrial approaches typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm: first pretraining a multimodal model, then applying its frozen representations to train the recommendation model. This decoupled framework suffers from misalignment between multimodal learning and recommendation objectives, as well as an inability to adapt dynamically to new data. To address these limitations, we propose LEMUR, the first large-scale multimodal recommender system trained end-to-end from raw data. By jointly optimizing both the multimodal and recommendation components, LEMUR ensures tighter alignment with downstream objectives while enabling real-time parameter updates. Constructing multimodal sequential representations from user history often entails prohibitively high computational costs. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose a novel memory bank mechanism that incrementally accumulates historical multimodal representations throughout the training process. After one month of deployment in Douyin Search, LEMUR has led to a 0.843% reduction in query change rate decay and a 0.81% improvement in QAUC. Additionally, LEMUR has shown significant gains across key offline metrics for Douyin Advertisement. Our results validate the superiority of end-to-end multimodal recommendation in real-world industrial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a LEMUR \u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e ID \u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa LEMUR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u91cf\u65b9\u5f0f\u7d2f\u79ef\u6574\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6296\u97f3\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\uff0cLEMUR \u4f7f\u67e5\u8be2\u53d8\u5316\u7387\u8870\u51cf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86 0.843%\uff0cQAUC \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 0.81%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cLEMUR \u5728\u6296\u97f3\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u79bb\u7ebf\u6307\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u7740\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities.

While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($\u03c1$) and head-tail ratio ($\u03b7$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models but hurt head-class accuracy.

The End of Term Web Archive alone contains, among other file types, millions of PDFs produced by the federal government. While preservation with web archives has been successful, significant challenges for access and discoverability remain. For example, current affordances for browsing the End of Term PDFs are limited to downloading and browsing individual PDFs, as well as performing basic keyword search across them. In this paper, we introduce GovScape, a public search system that supports multimodal searches across 10,015,993 federal government PDFs from the 2020 End of Term crawl (70,958,487 total PDF pages) - to our knowledge, all renderable PDFs in the 2020 crawl that are 50 pages or under. GovScape supports four primary forms of search over these 10 million PDFs: in addition to providing (1) filter conditions over metadata facets including domain and crawl date and (2) exact text search against the PDF text, we provide (3) semantic text search and (4) visual search against the PDFs across individual pages, enabling users to structure queries such as \"redacted documents\" or \"pie charts.\" We detail the constituent components of GovScape, including the search affordances, embedding pipeline, system architecture, and open source codebase. Significantly, the total estimated compute cost for GovScape's pre-processing pipeline for 10 million PDFs was approximately $1,500, equivalent to 47,000 PDF pages per dollar spent on compute, demonstrating the potential for immediate scalability. Accordingly, we outline steps that we have already begun pursuing toward multimodal search at the 100+ million PDF scale.

Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios.

To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives.

Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u7a00\u758f\u8fa8\u8bc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56de\u5f52\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u8fa8\u8bc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u5230\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e09\u6b21B\u6837\u6761\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u5bfc\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a group recommender system called Group Soft-Impute SVD, which leverages soft-impute singular value decomposition to enhance group recommendations. This approach addresses the challenge of sparse high-dimensional data using low-rank matrix completion. We compared the performance of Group Soft-Impute SVD with Group MF based approaches and found that our method outperforms the baselines in recall for small user groups while achieving comparable results across all group sizes when tasked on Goodbooks, Movielens, and Synthetic datasets.

Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis.

Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions.

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting.

Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6267\u884c\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6216\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u57288M\u548c150M\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5c06\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def(VQCs)\u96c6\u6210\u5230Transformer\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u5c11\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279(10\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u548c80\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8)\u53ef\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee31.5\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7ea610%\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u521d\u6b65\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains.

MOON has already been fully deployed across all stages of Taobao search advertising system, including retrieval, relevance, ranking, and so on. The performance gains are particularly significant on click-through rate (CTR) prediction task, which achieves an overall +20.00% online CTR improvement. Over the past three years, this project has delivered the largest improvement on CTR prediction task and undergone five full-scale iterations. Throughout the exploration and iteration of our MOON, we have accumulated valuable insights and practical experience that we believe will benefit the research community. MOON contains a three-stage training paradigm of \"Pretraining, Post-training, and Application\", allowing effective integration of multimodal representations with downstream tasks. Notably, to bridge the misalignment between the objectives of multimodal representation learning and downstream training, we define the exchange rate to quantify how effectively improvements in an intermediate metric can translate into downstream gains. Through this analysis, we identify the image-based search recall as a critical intermediate metric guiding the optimization of multimodal models.

This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations.

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies.

It accomplishes this by comprehensively analyzing both the intricate interrelationships among items within the set and their collective alignment with the user's preference profile. This method of set-level contextual understanding allows our model to capture complex relational patterns essential to user behavior, making it significantly more adept for sequential recommendation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, confirming that this set-wise perspective is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance in sequential recommendation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u50f5\u5316\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u96c6\u5408\u5f0f\u53cd\u601d\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08SRLF\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u4f53\u5224\u65ad\u6574\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u96c6\u5408\u5185\u9879\u76ee\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u96c6\u5408\u5f0f\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u5408\u5f0f\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine.

Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives.

Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings.

However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input.

We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning.

It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684MCN-CL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u91cd\u67e5\u8be2\u673a\u5236\u548c\u56f0\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6316\u6398\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u5355\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7206\u70b8\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u8feb\u5207\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MCN-CL\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u91cd\u67e5\u8be2\u673a\u5236\u548c\u56f0\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6316\u6398\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u53bb\u9664\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEMOCAP\u548cMELD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cWeighted F1 scores\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863.42%\u548c5.73%\u3002", "conclusion": "MCN-CL\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams.

Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops.

We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks.

Accepted for publication in the Journal of Information Systems Engineering and Management", "summary": "Object detection using images or videos captured by drones is a promising technology with significant potential across various industries. However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement. These results indicate that YOLO-Drone is a high-performance model with enhanced accuracy and speed compared to YOLOv11. To further validate its reliability, comparative experiments were conducted against other high-performance object detection models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10.

Alexander"], "title": "LLM enhanced graph inference for long-term disease progression modelling", "comment": null, "summary": "Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort.

Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ans\u00e4tze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning.

Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u901a\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5e7f\uff0c\u4f46\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0d\u5982\u73b0\u4ee3\u795e\u7ecf\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u3002\u795e\u7ecf\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e58\u79ef\uff08wPoE\uff09\u6267\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u4efb\u4f55\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u5404\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2.

Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations.

Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u9762\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5SurfaceBench\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u516c\u5f0f\u6216\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5339\u914d\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "method": "SurfaceBench\u5305\u542b183\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d615\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8de8\u8d8a\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u7a0b\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5305\u62ec\u5730\u9762\u5b9e\u51b5\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u53d8\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5408\u6210\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982Chamfer\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0a\u5076\u5c14\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8868\u9762\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SurfaceBench\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u5177\u6709LLM\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples.

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector.

Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual \"knowledge\" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations.

However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "EarthSight\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u536b\u661f\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u67e5\u8be2\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u5728\u8f68\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "EarthSight \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\uff1a(1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u536b\u661f\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\uff1b(2) \u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u67e5\u8be2\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u805a\u5408\u7528\u6237\u8bf7\u6c42\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\uff1b(3) \u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c3d\u65e9\u62d2\u7edd\u4f4e\u4ef7\u503c\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u8282\u7ea6\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "EarthSight \u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86 1.9 \u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4ece\u9996\u6b21\u63a5\u89e6\u5230\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7684\u7b2c 90 \u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ece 51 \u5206\u949f\u964d\u4f4e\u5230 21 \u5206\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "EarthSight \u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f7f\u661f\u5ea7\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u673a\u8f7d\u529f\u7387\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \\textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \\textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.\n  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks.

This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7 YOLO \u6a21\u578b YOLOv11n \u548c YOLOv12n \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e0d\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06 FER2013 \u548c KDEF \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528 mAP 0.5\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "YOLOv12n \u5728 KDEF \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u6027\u80fd (mAP 0.5 \u4e3a 95.6)\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728 FER2013 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684 mAP \u4e3a 63.8\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e YOLOv11n\u3002YOLOv11n \u5728 FER2013 \u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6 65.2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7 YOLO \u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5 AI \u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5019\u9009\u8005\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6538\u5173\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5916\u5728\u548c\u5185\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u533a\u5206\u5916\u5728\u548c\u5185\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u30022. \u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u30023. \u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u62bd\u6837\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5916\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5185\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5185\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u662f\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties.

However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u4e92\u8865\u84b8\u998f\uff08HCD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u6559\u5e08\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u4eablogits\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5b50logit\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\uff08SDD\uff09\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u635f\u5931\uff08OL\uff09\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u540c\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56logit\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "HCD\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5377\u79ef\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6c60\u5316\u5904\u7406\u5b66\u751f\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u7f51\u7edc\u5012\u6570\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5668\uff08CFM\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u5171\u4eablogits\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5b50logit\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\uff08SDD\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5171\u4eablogits\u5206\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50logits\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u7f51\u7edc\u7684logits\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u7ea0\u6b63\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b50logit\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6b63\u4ea4\u635f\u5931\uff08OL\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982CUB200\uff09\u548cImageNet-1K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHCD\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684KD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HCD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u5b66\u751f\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u6709\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Gent", "Christopher Jefferson"], "title": "Faster Symmetry Breaking Constraints for Abstract Structures", "comment": null, "summary": "In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6253\u7834\u5176\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u8fbe\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u539f\u751f\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u524d\u5fc5\u987b\u8f6c\u6362\u6216\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u662f\u8bb8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u641c\u7d22\u5bf9\u79f0\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u5feb\u6c42\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6253\u7834\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6253\u7834\u7531\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684 Akg\u00fcn \u7b49\u4eba (2025) \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6253\u7834\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6253\u7834\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures.

In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain.

Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment.

Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, \"Truth Last\", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks.

In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates.

We attribute this to a modality gap between the 3D tasks and the 2D training of VLM, which led to inefficient retrieval of 3D information from 2D input. To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM. Specifically, we design a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline comprising four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning. Evaluated in zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, our approach consistently improves spatial intelligence, achieving an 8.3\\% gain on SAT Real compared with baseline methods for instance. These results demonstrate that equipping VLMs with a 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, suggesting new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "SandboxVLM: \u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7f16\u7801\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7269\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a2D\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e3D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ece2D\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d223D\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSandboxVLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u62bd\u8c61\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u9ad8\u7a0b\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6295\u7968\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca3D\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728SAT Real\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e868.3%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc73D\u62bd\u8c61\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u51763D\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic.

Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data.

However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues.

Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers.

However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm.

The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search.

Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\\times$ runtime speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5171\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u79c1\u6709\u96f6\u9636\u7b97\u6cd5\u68af\u5ea6\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1(DP)\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5(\u5982DP-SGD)\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u662f\u5176\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u3002\u96f6\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u79c1\u6709\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e0eDP-SGD\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7528\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ec5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5668(PAZO)\uff0c\u8be5\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86PAZO\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cPAZO\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9690\u79c1/\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u57fa\u7ebf(\u5177\u6709\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e)\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe16\u500d\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PAZO\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7528\u3002"}}

A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time.

To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an \"Eigenbasis Score\", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations.

Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like \"Who is Undercover?\". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting \"undercover\" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u201c\u8c01\u662f\u5367\u5e95\u201d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6392\u9664\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff08MAD\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u8fa9\u8bba\u8005\u90fd\u662f\u7406\u6027\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f88\u96be\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u672c\u8eab\u4e5f\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5367\u5e95\u6e38\u620f\uff08MUG\uff09\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u201c\u5367\u5e95\u201d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u6765\u5224\u65ad\u54ea\u4e9b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "MUG\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6e90\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u8bc1\u636e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "MUG\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6392\u9664\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration.

While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDMC\u7684CLIP-based CIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002DMC\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565DMC-OT\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bf9\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDMC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565DMC-OT\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002DMC\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u90fd\u56fa\u5b9a\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002DMC-OT\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6765\u6821\u51c6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001Imagenet-R\u3001CUB-200\u548cUCF-101\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDMC\u548cDMC-OT\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86state-of-the-art\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dDMC-OT\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.80%\u3002", "conclusion": "DMC\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5176\u589e\u5f3a\u7248\u672cDMC-OT\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u5173\u8282\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u5173\u8282\u5e94\u7528\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5173\u8282\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08MJCA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff08BiGRU\uff09\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u3002\u5c06\u591a\u5173\u8282\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u8026\u5408\u548c\u5916\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cPI-MJCA-BiGRU\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14MJCA\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "PI-MJCA-BiGRU \u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u5173\u8282\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u7406\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer. Our lightweight, pre-attention expert routers achieve 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing about 15% improvement on absolute accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cpre-attention expert prediction\u201d\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8MoE LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u4f18\u5316\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\uff1b\u590d\u6742\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u4e2d\u6392\u5e8f\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5757\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepSeek V2 Lite\u3001Qwen3-30B\u548cPhi-mini-MoE\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8693.03%\u300194.69%\u548c97.62%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea615%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684pre-attention expert routers\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u53d6\u3002"}}

We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead.

These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the \"scope\" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \\$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \\$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpiderGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b83\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfLCA\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4e8eLCA\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53\u6392\u653e\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5168\u7403\u53d8\u6696\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u9996\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6392\u653e\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5904\u7f6e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5fc5\u4e0d\u53ef\u5c11\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08LCA\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SpiderGen\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b83\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfLCA\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4e8eLCA\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0SpiderGen\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684LCA\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u8981\u4e48\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u572810\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u4e0a\u7684F1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a62%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u72b6LCA\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSpiderGen\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4f4e\u4e8e1\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u572810\u5206\u949f\u5185\u751f\u6210LCA\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4f30\u8ba1\u78b3\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4eba\u529b\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u72b6LCA\u7684\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc725000\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u591a\u8fbe21\u4eba\u5929\u3002"}}

We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training.

Accurately predicting power outage recovery and impact is key to resilience of power grid. Recent advances in machine learning offer viable frameworks for estimating power outage duration from geospatial and weather data. However, three major challenges are inherent to the task in a real world setting: spatial dependency of the data, spatial heterogeneity of the impact, and moderate event data. We propose a novel approach to estimate the duration of severe weather-induced power outages through Graph Attention Networks (GAT).

This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression.

However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \\textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance.

Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple \"Think again\" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u65e5\u76ca\u9891\u7e41\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u201c\u518d\u60f3\u60f3\u201d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u8ffd\u95ee\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u201c\u518d\u60f3\u60f3\u201d\u63d0\u793a\u5bfc\u81f4Gemini 1.5 Flash\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea610%\uff0c\u800c\u5c06\u6b64\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u6539\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4Claude 3.5 Haiku\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d7.5%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5bf9\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6982\u7387\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u662f\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u63d0\u95ee\u4e0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72LLM\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset.

Code will be available", "summary": "Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with \"the right to be forgotten\" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGraphToxin\u7684\u56fe\u91cd\u6784\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u653b\u51fb\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684graph unlearning\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u5220\u9664\u7684\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u89e3\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u591a\u65b9\u53c2\u4e0e\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u5220\u9664\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6b8b\u7559\u75d5\u8ff9\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u5220\u9664\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGraphToxin\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u7834\u574f\u56fe\u89e3\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5df2\u5220\u9664\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u654f\u611f\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u62b5\u5fa1\u8fd9\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores.

However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data.

Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "EcoAlign\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06LVLM\u89c6\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u6743\u8861\u9884\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7528\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5269\u4f59\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LVLM)\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u8bf4\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50lvlm\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7528\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5173\u6ce8(\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f2\u89c6)\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "method": "EcoAlign\u589e\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u601d\u60f3\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u51fd\u6570(\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u51c0\u73b0\u503c)\u5bf9\u884c\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u6743\u8861\u9884\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7528\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5269\u4f59\u9884\u7b97\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u9632\u6b62\u6b3a\u9a97\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u5b89\u5168\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5f31\u8fde\u63a5\u539f\u5219\u6765\u6267\u884c\u7684\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf93\u4e2a\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548c2\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEcoAlign\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "EcoAlign\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684LVLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round \"telephone game\" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., \"hidden language.\" We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world.

Accepted as an Oral presentation at AAAI 2026. For code and dataset, see https://zane-zyqiu.github.io/EmoVid", "summary": "Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model.

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

However, slow sampling speed is an essential challenge for recent developed DM-based schemes. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel flow matching (FM)-based generative model for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation. We first formulate the channel estimation problem within FM framework, where the conditional probability path is constructed from the noisy channel distribution to the true channel distribution. In this case, the path evolves along the straight-line trajectory at a constant speed. Then, guided by this, we derive the velocity field that depends solely on the noise statistics to guide generative models training. Furthermore, during the sampling phase, we utilize the trained velocity field as prior information for channel estimation, which allows for quick and reliable noise channel enhancement via ordinary differential equation (ODE) Euler solver. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FM-based channel estimation scheme can significantly reduce the sampling overhead compared to other popular DM-based schemes, such as the score matching (SM)-based scheme.

Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios.

However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \\textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology.

This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks.

Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices.

This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts.

However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507.

This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u901a\u4fe1\u662f\u5373\u65f6\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5e26\u5bbd\u65e0\u9650\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5f88\u5c11\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u6d88\u606f\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5e26\u5bbd\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5408\u4f5c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u540c\u6b65\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63d0\u5021\u7edf\u4e00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u8bbaMARL\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u76d1\u7763\u9c81\u68d2\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff08URDA\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684UDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528VAT\u5728UDA\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "1) \u63ed\u793a\u4e86UDA+VAT\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u6311\u6218\uff1b2) \u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86URDA\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART) \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDART\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DART\u7b97\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86URDA\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347UDA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B.

In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture.

Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes.

While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGuR: An agentic AI system that dynamically adapts problem-solving strategies at inference time based on accumulated experience.", "motivation": "Existing agentic AI systems struggle to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions.

Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions.

AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks.

Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games.

Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "EmbryoDiff: a two-stage diffusion-based framework for identifying fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF).", "motivation": "Existing deep learning methods fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development and rely on single-focal information, leading to incomplete embryonic representations and feature ambiguity under cell occlusions.", "method": "A two-stage diffusion-based framework with a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy and a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block.", "result": "Achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy, respectively.", "conclusion": "EmbryoDiff effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods and enables accurate embryonic stage classification."}}

While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy.

Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u4fdd\u9669\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7acb\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DenseNet121\u3001SwinV2-B\u3001MedMamba\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u4fdd\u9669\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728MIMIC-CXR-JPG\u548cCheXpert\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08AUC\u7ea6\u4e3a0.67\u548c0.68\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u540e\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u5f25\u6563\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4f4d\u4e8e\u80f8\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e2d\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u5b66AI\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u518d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u8c03\u6574\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8981 \u091c\u093e\u0902\u091a \u0914\u0930\u89e3\u5f00\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6307\u7eb9\u3002"}}

We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses.

However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08HGC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u901a\u5e38\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "HGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08\u5757\u7ea7\u522b\uff09\u548c\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u522b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86HGC\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728COCO-Stuff\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cHGC\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8663%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff08MACs\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "HGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways.

This paper has been accepted by IJCNN 2025 but not published", "summary": "Automatic segmentation methods of polyps is crucial for assisting doctors in colorectal polyp screening and cancer diagnosis. Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCGNet outperforms recent networks, with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than the second-best network on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u606f\u8089\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edcMPCGNet\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u533b\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u606f\u8089\u7b5b\u67e5\u548c\u764c\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u606f\u8089\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u606f\u8089\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u606f\u8089\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u8026\u5408\u95e8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1aCGMFE\u3001WCAD\u548cDFA\u3002", "result": "MPCGNet\u5728ETIS-LaribPolypDB\u548cCVC-ColonDB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684mDice\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u7b2c\u4e8c\u597d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u9ad82.20%\u548c0.68%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eMPCGNet\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u3002"}}

However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed \"silver\" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification.

However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization.

The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata.

However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks.

A common approach is to minimize a statistical divergence between the (empirical) data distribution and a parameterized distribution, e.g., a normalizing flow (NF) or an energy-based model (EBM). In this context, the forward KL divergence is a ubiquitous due to its tractability, though its asymmetry may prevent capturing some properties of the target distribution. Symmetric alternatives involve brittle min-max formulations and adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial networks) or evaluating the reverse KL divergence, as is the case for the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which is challenging to compute from samples. This work sets out to develop a new approach to minimize the Jeffreys divergence. To do so, it uses a proxy model whose goal is not only to fit the data, but also to assist in optimizing the Jeffreys divergence of the main model.

Under review at IWSDS 2026", "summary": "LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from \"Is this statement correct?\" to \"Is this speaker correct?\". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal (\"The previous answer is incorrect.\") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d89\u53ca\u65e5\u5e38\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u6b64\u7c7b LLM \u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8981\u793e\u4ea4\u6216\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76 LLM \u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u6216\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4ece\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0cLLM \u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u4e8b\u5b9e\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4f1a\u8bdd\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u65bd\u52a0\u53cd\u9a73\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f1a\u8bdd\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u7acb\u573a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4e00\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u6846\u67b6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5949\u627f\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u53d8\u5f97\u8fc7\u4e8e\u6311\u5254\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u4e3a 9.24%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e5f\u4f1a\u663e\u7740\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u503c\u5f97\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes.

Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6781\u7aef\u6c14\u5019\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u70ed\u6d6a\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6539\u8fdb\u6c14\u5019\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u8868\u6c14\u6e29\u662f\u5426\u8d85\u8fc7\u5176q\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u3002\u4f7f\u7528power mean\u6765\u805a\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528power mean\u805a\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684power\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7740\u6240\u9009\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u9608\u503c\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u3002"}}

Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an \"I don't know\" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u5426\u5b9a\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u503e\u5411\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u8d1f\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u8d1f\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8d1f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540cprompt\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u8d1f\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u8d1f\u6ce8\u610f\u5934\uff0c\u4f46\u5f71\u54cd\u8d1f\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u7d20\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2apipeline\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u96c6\uff1a\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u56de\u7b54\u662f-\u5426\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5426\u5b9a\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u56de\u7b54\u662f-\u5426\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5426\u5b9a\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u201c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u201d\u7684\u9009\u9879\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u8d1f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u8d1f\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u800c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u8d1f\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u504f\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eLoRA\u878d\u5408\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f3a\u5236\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2aLoRA\u7ecf\u5e38\u652f\u914d\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5e72\u6270\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7684\uff1a\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LoRA\u5360\u636e\u4f4e\u79e9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\uff08SVD\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3b\u8981\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u4e3b\u9898LoRA\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5176\u6b63\u4ea4\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6f\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e73\u6ed1\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u4e3b\u9898\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "NP-LoRA\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eDINO\u548cCLIP\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u504f\u597d\u5f97\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u5e72\u548cLoRA\u5bf9\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86LoRA\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u5411\u5728\u878d\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e94\u907f\u514d\u53d7\u5230\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6295\u5f71\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eLoRA\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f3a\u5236\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5e72\u6270\u3002"}}

The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \\textbf{D}ynamic Deep \\textbf{G}raph Learning for \\textbf{I}ncomplete \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}iew \\textbf{C}lustering with \\textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism.

However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+\u03b4$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality.

We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2.

Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data.

To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \\textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \\textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details.

A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6839\u636e Bloom \u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u8003\u8bd5\u9898\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u8003\u8bd5\u9898\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 SVM\uff09\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5982 LSTM\uff09\u548c Transformer \u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 BERT\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684 SVM \u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u5230 94%\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a OpenAI \u548c Gemini \u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u589e\u5f3a\u7684 SVM\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e Bloom \u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5f88\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We explore sparse convolutional networks for representation learning on TPC data, finding that a sparse ResNet architecture, even with randomly set weights, provides useful structured vector embeddings of events. Pre-training this architecture on a simple physics-motivated binary classification task further improves the embedding quality. Using data from the GAseous Detector with GErmanium Tagging (GADGET) II TPC, a detector optimized for measuring low-energy $\u03b2$-delayed particle decays, we represent raw pad-level signals as sparse tensors, train Minkowski Engine ResNet models, and probe the resulting event-level embeddings which reveal rich event structure. As a cross-detector test, we embed data from the Active-Target TPC (AT-TPC) -- a detector designed for nuclear reaction studies in inverse kinematics -- using the same encoder.

Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks.

For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge.
