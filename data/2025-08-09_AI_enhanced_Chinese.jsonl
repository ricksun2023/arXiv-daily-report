Traditional methods, such as\nextreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency\ndomain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible\ninformation loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure\nfrequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image\nartifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA).

On the\nother hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination\ndistortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global\ncontext provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely\nderaining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows\nthat it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs.

While recent advanced large reasoning models like\nDeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,\ntheir reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,\nan attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property\nprediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)\na format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count\nreward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward\nusing advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated\nattributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of\nrelevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for\nthe molecular property more effectively.

Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main\ntypes: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep\nreasoning (e.g., \"what is in the image?\"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,\nwhich concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle\nclues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and\ncomplex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local\ndetails than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though\noccupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information\nfor robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel\nframework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,\noften occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these\nclues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully\ndesigned questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System\nState, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by\nstructured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from\nthem. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual\nevidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to\nenhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,\nintegration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like\nanalysis.

However, integrating all tool information into the\nlimited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient\ntool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on\nsemantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve\nrelevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently,\noverlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of\nprerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in\nthis paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the\ndependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval.\nFirst, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for\nidentifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool\ndependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into\ntheir representations.

While Federated\nRecommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle\nwith non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation\nquality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)\nmethods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data\naccess, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that\nintegrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data\nwhile preserving privacy.

Weakly\nSupervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized\nscene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG\nmethods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo\nlabels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,\nobject-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required\nfor DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To\naddress the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we\npropose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)\nmethod, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware\ndynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware\nknowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that\ngenerate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and\ninteractive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation\nstrategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the\nattention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step\nyields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG.

However,\nexisting methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or\ndensely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these\nlimitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for\nOW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental\nsegmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias\ncaused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.\nBy leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables\nprototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the\nlack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical\nprototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which\ncorrespond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual\nawareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined\nprototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human\nfeedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality\nsegmentation for both base and novel classes.

However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive\ndecoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting\nfrom over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose\nSODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in\nimage compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step\nrefinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained\nVAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the\niterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve\nfidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is\nfaithful to the original image.

In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for\nrealizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,\nwe first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by\ngenerating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a\nself-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert\ndomains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality\nsynthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training\nmeta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue\nagents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform\n\\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our\nagents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness\nin enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\\footnote{Code and Data:\nhttps://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2025-meta-review-as-dialog", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores using dialogue agents to assist meta-reviewers.

While\nrecent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,\nhave demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in\nhydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize\nacross diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective\nmechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce\nRetrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a\nframework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological\nepisodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an\nexternal archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant\npatterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and\npredictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or\nfine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and\nmutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on\nreal-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework\nyields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy.

This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to\nlocal recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback\npathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.\nRecurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown\nto reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and\ninvariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision\nTransformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional\nperspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context\nin the early layers of a deep neural network.

A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with\ndiversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity\nthrough randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity\ntrade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage\nthis trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment\nrange. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called\nSelf-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct\ncomponents: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each\nbase learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This\ndecomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss\nfunction, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,\nthus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its\nvariants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more\nconsistent changes in diversity.

Both\nalgorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a\nmessage-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum\nacceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is\nhighly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition\nin a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,\nbecause of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the\ncompression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.\n  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed\ndecentralized adaptive method.

However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations\nboth within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical\nshortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining\ngeneralization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational\nMultimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor\nadjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such\nshortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a\nmulti-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal\ndependencies.

To address these challenges, we\npropose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection\ngating for unified multimodal harmful content detection.

Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents\nrefine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and\nefficiency.

This process yields a targeted,\nself-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.\nEmpirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across\ndifferent backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on\nmath-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "R-Zero\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6311\u6218\u8005\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u8005\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u9884\u5148\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7136\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5c06\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "R-Zero\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u7840LLM\u5f00\u59cb\uff0cR-Zero\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u8005\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u8005\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u52a8\u5171\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\uff1a\u6311\u6218\u8005\u56e0\u63d0\u51fa\u63a5\u8fd1\u89e3\u51b3\u8005\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u8005\u56e0\u89e3\u51b3\u6311\u6218\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u9884\u5148\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "R-Zero\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e3b\u5e72LLM\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5c06Qwen3-4B-Base\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86+6.49\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86+7.54\u3002", "conclusion": "R-Zero\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e3b\u5e72LLM\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5c06Qwen3-4B-Base\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86+6.49\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86+7.54\u3002"}}

As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values.

In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel\nprompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very\nfirst to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our\nmethod compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and\nemploys a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on\ntissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks\nspanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene\nexpression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs\nacross both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable\ninsights into each model's biosemantic specialisation.

Accurate and robust segmentation\nmodels are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision\nmaking across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in\nimage characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of\ngeneralizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.\nThis model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for\nmodality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major\nchallenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT\nvs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these\nissues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables\nmultimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method\nintegrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module\nthat harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local\ntraining. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset\nand a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was\ninitially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its\nperformance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT\ndata were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data\nscenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test\ncases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.\nIn the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized\nperformance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a\n10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong\ncross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedGIN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60(FL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u539f\u59cb\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff0c \u5e76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728AI\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u624b\u672f\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u4ee5\u53ca\u963b\u6b62\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60(FL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5f3a\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027(GIN)\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u534f\u8c03\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0e\u6ca1\u6709GIN\u7684FL\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cFedGIN\u5728MRI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4e0a\u76843D Dice\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8612%\u81f318%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cFedGIN\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ec5MRI\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDice\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8630%\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ec5CT\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDice\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8610%\u3002", "conclusion": "FedGIN\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference\nlearning.

Hierarchical Federated\nLearning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks\nacross intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and\nrobustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a\ncritical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data\ndistributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,\nreducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain\nGeneralization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain\nshifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In\nthis paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization\n(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within\nhierarchical architectures.

Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM\nsignificantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across\nmultiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.\nMoreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter\ngeneralization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,\nresulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HFedATM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u90a6\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u5377\u79ef\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u6536\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7531\u4e8e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u4e2d\u592e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60(HFL)\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u8282\u70b9(\u7ad9\u70b9)\u4e0a\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cHFL\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u7ecf\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u9650\u5236:\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5373\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u7ad9\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8054\u90a6\u57df\u6cdb\u5316(FedDG)\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u7ecf\u51fa\u73b0\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0eHFL\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5HFedATM\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u65b9\u5f0f\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u7ad9\u70b9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u6536\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u6765\u5408\u5e76\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "HFedATM\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u73b0\u6709FedDG\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u5c42\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cHFedATM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "HFedATM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u6709FedDG\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u5c42\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cHFedATM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual\nconditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of\nannotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a\ngeneralizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data\npre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a\ntwo-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual\ninteraction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data\nscarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first\nmulti-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of\napproximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with\ncorrespondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated\ntransformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges\nin training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,\ndistribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive\nmulti-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and\nimprove representation quality across domains.

Despite this\nprogress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and\ninsufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance\ndegradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that\nintroduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning\nmodule with a recycling mechanism.

However, its performance significantly degrades when\ndomain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain\nFew-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance\ndegradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation\nmodels on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,\ndriven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize\ndata transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS\napproaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS\nmethod that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target\ndomain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we\nfirst append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of\na pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the\nshared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the\nTSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and\na Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes\nglobal-local visual features to align image features across different views,\nwhile the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal\nfeatures (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the\noutputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent\nfusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.\nUnder both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average\nsegmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\\% and 4.11\\%, respectively, across\nfour cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS\nmethods.

In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel\ndiffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from\narbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen\nviews, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching\n(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS\nemploys a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse\ngeometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained\nalignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies\nhigh-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,\nCVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs\nthe original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a\ndiffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision\nfrom extrapolated data.
