### [1] [TokenShapley: Token Level Context Attribution with Shapley Value](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05261)
*Yingtai Xiao,Yuqing Zhu,Sirat Samyoun,Wanrong Zhang,Jiachen T. Wang,Jian Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokenShapley is a token-level attribution method using Shapley values and KNN-based retrieval, improving accuracy by 11-23% compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the response, such as numbers, years, or names.

Method: a novel token-level attribution method that combines Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs

Result: TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution approach

Conclusion: TokenShapley outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an 11-23% improvement in accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context
learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a
challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these
methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the
response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we
propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines
Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques
inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed
datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify
token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution
approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an
11-23% improvement in accuracy.

### [2] [User Behavior Prediction as a Generic, Robust, Scalable, and Low-Cost Evaluation Strategy for Estimating Generalization in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05266)
*Sougata Saha,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出使用用户行为预测来评估 LLM 的泛化能力，实验结果表明 GPT-4o 表现最好，但所有模型都有提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据污染，评估大型语言模型 (LLM) 的泛化能力具有挑战性。知识检索和推理任务不适合衡量泛化能力，因为 LLM 不是为特定任务而训练的。因此，提出用户行为预测作为一种理论上合理、可扩展且稳健的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种新的用户行为预测框架，并在电影和音乐推荐数据集上进行了测试。

Result: 结果与框架的预测一致，表明 GPT-4o 优于 GPT-4o-mini 和 Llama。

Conclusion: GPT-4o 在用户行为预测方面优于 GPT-4o-mini 和 Llama，但所有模型仍有改进空间，尤其是 Llama。

Abstract: Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes
cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will
become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks
are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for
specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect
of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative.
We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music
recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms
GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement,
especially Llama.

### [3] [An Adaptive Supervised Contrastive Learning Framework for Implicit Sexism Detection in Digital Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05271)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Aditya Shah,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASCEND 是一种用于检测隐式性别歧视的自适应监督对比学习框架，它优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的全球影响力扩大了仇恨内容的传播，包括隐式性别歧视，而传统检测方法通常会忽略这些内容。

Method: 引入了一种用于隐式性别歧视检测的自适应监督对比学习框架 (ASCEND)。该方法的一个关键创新是结合了基于阈值的对比学习：通过计算嵌入之间的余弦相似度，我们有选择地将那些相似度超过可学习阈值的样本对视为正样本。这种机制通过稳健地将语义相似文本的表示拉到一起，同时将不相似的文本分开，从而减少假阳性和假阴性，从而改进了嵌入空间。

Result: 在 EXIST2021 和 MLSC 数据集上的评估表明，ASCEND 显著优于现有方法，平均 Macro F1 提高了 9.86%、29.63% 和 32.51%。

Conclusion: ASCEND在多个任务中显著优于现有方法，平均 Macro F1 提高了 9.86%、29.63% 和 32.51%，突显了其在捕捉隐式性别歧视语言的细微线索方面的有效性。

Abstract: The global reach of social media has amplified the spread of hateful content,
including implicit sexism, which is often overlooked by conventional detection
methods. In this work, we introduce an Adaptive Supervised Contrastive lEarning
framework for implicit sexism detectioN (ASCEND). A key innovation of our
method is the incorporation of threshold-based contrastive learning: by
computing cosine similarities between embeddings, we selectively treat only
those sample pairs as positive if their similarity exceeds a learnable
threshold. This mechanism refines the embedding space by robustly pulling
together representations of semantically similar texts while pushing apart
dissimilar ones, thus reducing false positives and negatives. The final
classification is achieved by jointly optimizing a contrastive loss with a
cross-entropy loss. Textual features are enhanced through a word-level
attention module. Additionally, we employ sentiment, emotion, and toxicity
features. Evaluations on the EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets demonstrate that
ASCEND significantly outperforms existing methods, with average Macro F1
improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% across multiple tasks, highlighting
its efficacy in capturing the subtle cues of implicit sexist language.

*Miloud Mihoubi,Meriem Zerkouk,Belkacem Chikhaoui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI framework predicts student dropout using RAG, prompt engineering, and cross-modal attention, outperforming conventional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical machine learning models often fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors in student interactions.

Method: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), prompt engineering, and cross-modal attention fusion

Result: Achieves 89% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false negatives by 21%.

Conclusion: This AI framework effectively predicts student dropout risks and suggests interventions.

Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with
profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning
models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often
fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in
unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI
framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic
innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment
analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors, and cross-modal
attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and
socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated
knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets
student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized
prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload
anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with
temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk profiles. Evaluated on a
longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and
an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false
negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable
interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship
programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive
analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate
dropout risks in global education systems

### [5] [LCDS: A Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary Generation System Supporting Source Attribution and Expert Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05319)
*Cheng Yuan,Xinkai Rui,Yongqi Fan,Yawei Fan,Boyang Zhong,Jiacheng Wang,Weiyan Zhang,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LCDS is proposed to address hallucination and source attribution issues in LLM-based discharge summary generation by using a source mapping table and logical rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in automated discharge summary generation suffer from hallucination issues and struggle to attribute generated content to long-form EMR data.

Method: The paper proposes LCDS, a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system that constructs a source mapping table using textual similarity and incorporates logical rules.

Result: LCDS generates more reliable discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields and supports source attribution for generated content.

Conclusion: LCDS generates reliable discharge summaries, supports source attribution, and allows experts to provide feedback for incremental fine-tuning of LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination
issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information
without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically
consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the
generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS,
a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a
source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and
discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover,
LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate
more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields.
Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing
experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors. The
resulting golden discharge summaries are subsequently recorded for incremental
fine-tuning of LLMs. Our project and demo video are in the GitHub repository
https://github.com/ycycyc02/LCDS.

*William Fleshman,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LAG方法，无需额外训练或访问数据，即可有效地在每个token和每一层上过滤、检索和应用专家，在各种知识密集型任务上实现了优于现有data-free方法的性能，并且与RAG等其他解决方案兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对特定任务和领域的微调语言模型专家的激增，需要有效的选择和组合方法。

Method: 提出了一种LoRA-Augmented Generation (LAG)方法，用于利用大型知识库和特定于任务的LoRA适配器。LAG无需额外训练或访问数据，并有效地在每个token和每一层上过滤、检索和应用专家。

Result: LAG在各种知识密集型任务上实现了优于现有data-free方法的性能。

Conclusion: LAG在各种知识密集型任务上优于现有data-free方法，并且与RAG等其他解决方案兼容。

Abstract: The proliferation of fine-tuned language model experts for specific tasks and
domains signals the need for efficient selection and combination methods. We
propose LoRA-Augmented Generation (LAG) for leveraging large libraries of
knowledge and task-specific LoRA adapters. LAG requires no additional training
or access to data, and efficiently filters, retrieves, and applies experts on a
per-token and layer basis. We evaluate LAG on various knowledge-intensive
tasks, achieving superior performance over existing data-free methods. We
explore scenarios where additional data is available, demonstrating LAG's
compatibility with alternative solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG).

### [8] [On the Bias of Next-Token Predictors Toward Systematically Inefficient Reasoning: A Shortest-Path Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05362)
*Riccardo Alberghi,Elizaveta Demyanenko,Luca Biggio,Luca Saglietti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在低效的轨迹上训练的模型，能更好地推广到未见过的图，因为这使得训练信号更容易优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）推理的两个关键因素：(i) 分配更多的测试时间计算往往有助于解决更难的问题，但通常会在推理过程中引入冗余，以及 (ii) 当推理是系统的和增量的，形成类似于人类解决问题的结构化思维链（CoT）时，计算是最有效的。

Method: 在分层图中的最短路径任务上训练decoder-only transformers，使用自定义的分词器，比较在最优自下而上的动态编程轨迹上训练的模型与在更长的、有效的、涉及回溯的轨迹上训练的模型。

Result: 在相同的训练token预算下，在低效轨迹上训练的模型比在最优轨迹上训练的模型更好地推广到未见过的图。这种好处不是由于长度本身造成的——将任意的冗余注入到推理轨迹中并不能提供帮助，甚至会损害性能。

Conclusion: 模型在低效的轨迹上训练，能更好地推广到未见过的图。泛化与模型对下一个token预测的置信度相关，这表明长、连贯和局部增量的轨迹使训练信号更容易优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for
improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more
test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces
redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when
reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought
(CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we
introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs.
We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a
custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic
programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving
backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained
on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not
due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails
to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization
correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting
that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal
easier to optimize.

*Guanzhong Pan,Mei Tan,Hyunji Nam,Lucía Langlois,James Malamut,Liliana Deonizio,Dorottya Demszky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EduCoder是一个开源工具，旨在简化教育对话的注释，它支持复杂代码簿、多种注释类型和上下文材料，以提高数据可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用文本注释工具很少能解决教育对话转录编码的复杂性，这些复杂性包括定义复杂教学特征的代码簿、支持开放式和分类编码，以及将话语与外部特征（如课程目的和教学的教学价值）联系起来。

Method: EduCoder工具的设计和实现，包括其支持复杂代码簿定义、分类和开放式注释类型以及上下文材料整合的功能。

Result: EduCoder提供了一个并排比较多个注释者响应的功能，允许比较和校准注释，以提高数据可靠性。该系统是开源的，并提供演示视频。

Conclusion: EduCoder是一个开源的领域专用工具，旨在支持教育对话的语句级注释，它通过提供一个平台，供研究人员和领域专家基于观察到的数据协作定义复杂的代码簿，从而应对了教育对话转录编码的复杂性。

Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support
utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text
annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the
complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse
teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining
codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and
categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such
as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder
is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers
and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on
observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types
along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side
comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and
calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system
is open-source, with a demo video available.

### [10] [The Generalization Ridge: Information Flow in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05387)
*Ruidi Chang,Chunyuan Deng,Hanjie Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer模型的中间层对于泛化至关重要，预测信息在中间层达到峰值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于 Transformer 的语言模型在自然语言生成 (NLG) 任务中取得了最先进的性能，但它们用于合成任务相关信息的内部机制仍未得到充分理解。先前的研究表明，中间层通常比最终层产生更具泛化性的表示，但这种泛化能力如何在训练期间出现并在各层之间传播仍不清楚。

Method: 提出了 InfoRidge，一个信息论框架，用于表征预测信息如何在深度上变化。引入残差缩放系数，可训练的标量参数应用于每个残差块，作为评估各个transformer层相对重要性的功能探针。

Result: 预测信息在中间上层达到峰值，形成泛化岭，然后在最后一层下降，反映了泛化和记忆之间的过渡。在分布偏移下，模型降低了最后一层的权重，并越来越依赖岭层，突出了它们在泛化中的作用。

Conclusion: 中间层在支持泛化方面起着关键作用。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, yet their internal mechanisms for
synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While
prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable
representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and
propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,
we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how
predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations
and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to
trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during
training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a
consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle
layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,
reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further
investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling
coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which
serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual
transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,
models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,
highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new
insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the
critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

### [11] [Controlling What You Share: Assessing Language Model Adherence to Privacy Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05391)
*Guillem Ramírez,Alexandra Birch,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using privacy profiles to control data exposure when using LLMs, but current models still need improvement in understanding and complying with user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users often need to expose their data to service providers when accessing LLMs via commercial APIs, which raises privacy concerns.

Method: A framework where a local model uses privacy profiles to rewrite queries before sending them to an external model.

Result: Introduced PEEP, a multilingual dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with synthetic privacy profiles. Experiments show lightweight LLMs can follow instructions to some extent.

Conclusion: Lightweight LLMs can follow user-defined privacy instructions to some extent but face consistent challenges, highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with user-defined privacy preferences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but
this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this
paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy
profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should
not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these
instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the
user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with
performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual
dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with
synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can
follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges,
highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with
user-defined privacy preferences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GeoFact-X，这是一个基于地理的多语言事实推理基准，带有五种语言的注释推理轨迹：英语、印地语、日语、斯瓦希里语和泰语。我们进一步提出了一种新颖的训练方法BRIDGE，该方法通过语言一致性奖励来指导监督微调和测试时强化学习，以使推理与输入语言保持一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在数学、事实问答和代码生成等领域取得了优异的性能，但它们在这些任务中的多语言推理能力仍未得到充分发展。特别是对于斯瓦希里语或泰语等低资源语言，LLM 经常会误解提示或默认为英语推理。这种对高资源语言的隐性偏见会损害事实准确性、可解释性和信任。

Method: 我们提出BRIDGE，一种新颖的训练方法，该方法通过语言一致性奖励来指导监督微调和测试时强化学习，以使推理与输入语言保持一致。

Result: 我们的结果表明，BRIDGE 显著提高了多语言推理的保真度。

Conclusion: BRIDGE显著提高了多语言推理的保真度，证明了推理感知多语言强化学习对于强大的跨语言泛化至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like
mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning
capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource
languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or
default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource
languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current
multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models
actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce
GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with
annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese,
Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that
guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a
language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.
Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to
assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning
traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.
Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning
fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement
learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在开放式问答中整合上下文时，会忽略上下文中靠后的信息，即使是使用思维链（CoT）提示的推理模型也是如此。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型能够利用上下文和参数知识，但它们如何优先考虑和整合这些来源仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 我们引入了一个新颖的评估框架CoPE，它可以系统地测量跨模型和语言的上下文知识（CK）和参数知识（PK）。

Result: 大型语言模型往往会忽略或降低上下文中靠后出现的信息的优先级，揭示了一种影响上下文基础的强烈的定位偏差。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型倾向于忽略上下文中靠后的信息，推理模型对上下文的使用甚至低于非推理模型。基于这些发现，我们设计了基于提示的方法来有效利用输入上下文，并通过一个总结案例研究表明，知情的提示可以改善事实依据并减少幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and
parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources
remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that
systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK)
across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English,
Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate
context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question
answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where
LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given
context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding.
We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted
with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models
without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting,
in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to
degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based
methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to
summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual
grounding and reduces hallucination.

TL;DR: gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of ideology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While the ideological divide over abortion is well documented, less is known about how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape public discourse.

Method: Drawing on nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X (formerly Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology and location

Result: gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of ideology. This creates a gender gap in abortion attitudes that grows more pronounced in conservative regions. The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion further intensified online engagement, disproportionately mobilizing pro-abortion women in areas where access was under threat.

Conclusion: Abortion discourse is not only ideologically polarized but also deeply structured by gender and place, highlighting the central role of identity in shaping political expression during moments of institutional disruption.

Abstract: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
Organization marked a turning point in the national debate over reproductive
rights. While the ideological divide over abortion is well documented, less is
known about how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape
public discourse. Drawing on nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X
(formerly Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology and location, we
show that gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional
expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of
ideology. This creates a gender gap in abortion attitudes that grows more
pronounced in conservative regions. The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion further
intensified online engagement, disproportionately mobilizing pro-abortion women
in areas where access was under threat. These findings reveal that abortion
discourse is not only ideologically polarized but also deeply structured by
gender and place, highlighting the central role of identity in shaping
political expression during moments of institutional disruption.

TL;DR: SARA balances local precision and global knowledge coverage in RAG by combining text snippets and semantic compression vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Restricted effective context length and redundancy in retrieved documents in Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG).

Method: SARA, a unified RAG framework combining natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors.

Result: SARA improves answer relevance (+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53).

Conclusion: SARA consistently improves answer relevance, correctness, and semantic similarity across various datasets and LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but faces key challenges: restricted effective context
length and redundancy in retrieved documents. Pure compression-based approaches
reduce input size but often discard fine-grained details essential for factual
accuracy. We propose SARA, a unified RAG framework that balances local
precision and global knowledge coverage under tight context budgets. SARA
combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors to
jointly enhance context efficiency and answer correctness. It represents
contexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans

interpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative
evidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking
of contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families
(Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PhoniTale, a cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that helps L2 learners acquire vocabulary by leveraging phonological similarity between their L1 and L2. PhoniTale's performance is comparable to human-authored mnemonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2) learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages, rather than the reverse.

Method: a novel cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics

Result: PhoniTale performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics

Conclusion: PhoniTale performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics and highlight key areas for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)
learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as
English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate
vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's
first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this
research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,
rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel
cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence
based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We
evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,
comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated
approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term
recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale
performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas
for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

TL;DR: LLMs' language understanding is examined at word/sentence level using semantic theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It is controversial to what extent LLMs truly understand language.

Method: Examining inner workings of LLMs and their generated representation of language; drawing on classical semantic theories by Frege and Russell.

Result: A more nuanced picture of the potential semantic capabilities of LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs may not truly understand language semantics at word and sentence level.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to
replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text
generation to engaging in conversations. However, it remains controversial to
what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by
narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence
level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated
representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by
Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic
capabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset and models for toxicity detection, highlighting the importance of community-informed annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language.

Method: The paper introduces MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. The posts are augmented with LLM-generated conversational scenarios.

Result: State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on context-augmented posts.

Conclusion: The paper releases LLAMACITIZEN-8B and GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS, which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. The findings highlight the importance of community-informed annotation and modeling for inclusive content moderation.

Abstract: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive

toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing
toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse
diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important
context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address
this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K

conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment
MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios.
State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API,
GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong
performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple
medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular
reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from
doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and
sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these
real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on
healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we
investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical
datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and
analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose
an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations,
enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further
research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source

TL;DR: R2-LLMs通过分层检索增强推理，提升了大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的测试时性能，无需依赖昂贵的思维链数据蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放已成为语言建模中一种有前途的范例，它利用推理时额外的计算资源来增强模型性能。

Method: R2-LLMs是一个新颖且通用的分层检索增强推理框架，旨在改进大型语言模型（LLM）中的测试时缩放，而无需从更高级的模型中进行蒸馏以获得思维链（CoT）训练数据。它集成了双层检索的上下文学习：粗略层提取抽象模板，精细层在蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）期间检索类似的中间解决方案步骤。

Result: R2-LLMs是一种鲁棒的分层推理增强方法，可增强上下文级别的推理，同时与步骤级别的树搜索方法无缝集成。利用PRM，它可以改进候选生成和决策制定，从而提高推理准确性。

Conclusion: R2-LLMs在MATH500、GSM8K和OlympiadBench-TO数据集上实现了显著的相对改进，使用LLaMA-3.1-8B相比基线提高了高达16%，展示了该方法在复杂推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance
model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile
hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve
test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring
distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating
dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our
approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and
retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context
learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs
efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference
mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a
process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical
reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while
seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it
refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning
accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO
datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16%
using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of
our approach in complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在提高大型语言模型（LLM）对格式和指令约束的遵循度方面存在不足，要么成本高昂，要么导致输出质量下降。

Method: Re5 提取用户指令中的任务和约束组件，执行结构评估以防止错误累积，并应用细粒度的约束特定内容评估，然后进行选择性修订。

Result: Re5 实现了与使用 GPT-4o-mini 生成的数据训练的模型相当的指令遵循性能，同时保持了响应质量，相对未修改的初始响应胜率达到 64.24%。

Conclusion: Re5 通过自评估和修订框架，在少量数据下实现了与使用 GPT-4o-mini 生成的数据训练的模型相当的指令遵循性能，同时保持了响应质量，相对未修改的初始响应胜率达到 64.24%。

Abstract: Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs)
adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective
approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.
However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a
single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have
been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision
iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a
resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage
high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation
capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a
degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed
to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of
the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user
instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,
and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by
selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving
improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,
enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative
refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves
instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data
generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of
data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the
non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and
effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external
supervision.

*Mingzhe Li,Jing Xiang,Qishen Zhang,Kaiyang Wan,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a flipped knowledge distillation paradigm where an LLM learns from an SLM using LoRA and Margin-aware Contrastive Learning, achieving improved performance on text matching tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from an LLM to an SLM. However, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective domain-specific representations in tasks such as text matching. This paper aims to leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the rich semantic understanding of LLMs.

Method: A flipped knowledge distillation paradigm is introduced, where an LLM learns from an SLM. The LLM is reinterpreted in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA, and a Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach is used to align the encoder's representations and similarities with the similarity scores produced by the teacher SLM.

Result: Experiments on financial and healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm.

Conclusion: The proposed flipped knowledge distillation paradigm allows LLMs to learn from SLMs, achieving improved performance on financial and healthcare benchmarks and real-world applications. The model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large
Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such
as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective
domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of
input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the
rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge
distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the
architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by
reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder
generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output
space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their
similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the
teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.
The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and
adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative
samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing
the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and
healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its
effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

Conclusion: HIRAG训练策略显著提高了模型在RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, 和PubmedQA等数据集上的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for
addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time
information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily
rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model
itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG
generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document
quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that
fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG
task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To
address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively
hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant
information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information
across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further
process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new
RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering"
strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by
utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the
HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on
datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

Result: Omni-router Transformer is able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively

Conclusion: Omni-router Transformer achieves lower training loss and consistently outperforms dense and Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness to diverse data.

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling
to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the
Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis
reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly
correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the
cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater
specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call
this model \emph{Omni-router Transformer}. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse,
out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is
able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and
Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%,
respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn
conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of
continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities
and training paradigms. We introduce a novel approach to address this
discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We
present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into
an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our
pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training
dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that
exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can
enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory
and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during
pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding,
without compromising base performance. DocTalk is available at

TL;DR: LVLM 在非模态补全任务中表现出与人类相当的性能，但在特定对象类型和日语提示下存在准确性差异，表明模型可能缺乏日语语言能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发大型视觉语言模型 (LVLM) 的主要目标之一是设计可以帮助人类完成多模态任务的系统，包括解释感知体验的描述。在这种情况下，一个中心现象是非模态补全，即人们即使在物体的一部分被隐藏时也能感知到物体。虽然大量研究评估了计算机视觉算法是否可以检测或重建被遮挡区域，但 LVLM 在与非模态补全相关的文本上的推理能力仍未得到探索。

Method: 构建了一个基于基本形式本体的基准，以实现对非模态补全的系统分类。

Result: 许多 LVLM 在总体上实现了与人类相当的性能，但它们在某些类型的对象完成方面的准确性存在差异。值得注意的是，在某些类别中，一些 LLaVA-NeXT 变体和 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 在原始图像上的准确率低于缺少视觉内容的空白刺激。有趣的是，这种差异仅在日语提示下出现，表明这些模型缺乏日语特定的语言能力。

Conclusion: 许多 LVLM 在总体上实现了与人类相当的性能，但它们在某些类型的对象完成方面的准确性存在差异。值得注意的是，在某些类别中，一些 LLaVA-NeXT 变体和 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 在原始图像上的准确率低于缺少视觉内容的空白刺激。有趣的是，这种差异仅在日语提示下出现，表明这些模型缺乏日语特定的语言能力。

Abstract: One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs)
is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including
interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in
this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when
parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed
whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions,
the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain
unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic
Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion.
Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance
overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed.
Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking
visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese
prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence
among these models.

Motivation: 自动语音识别 (ASR) 系统越来越多地被证实对不同的说话人和说话人群体存在偏差，例如，由于性别、年龄或口音。

Method: 比较不同的性能和偏差指标，评估最先进的端到端荷兰语 ASR 系统，并使用多种偏差缓解策略。

Result: 平均误差率不足以衡量 ASR 系统的性能和偏差。

Conclusion: 误差率不足以衡量 ASR 系统的性能和偏差，需要补充其他指标。

Abstract: There is increasingly more evidence that automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems are biased against different speakers and speaker groups, e.g., due to
gender, age, or accent. Research on bias in ASR has so far primarily focused on
detecting and quantifying bias, and developing mitigation approaches. Despite
this progress, the open question is how to measure the performance and bias of
a system. In this study, we compare different performance and bias measures,
from literature and proposed, to evaluate state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR
systems for Dutch. Our experiments use several bias mitigation strategies to
address bias against different speaker groups. The findings reveal that
averaged error rates, a standard in ASR research, alone is not sufficient and
should be supplemented by other measures. The paper ends with recommendations
for reporting ASR performance and bias to better represent a system's
performance for diverse speaker groups, and overall system bias.

TL;DR: Using LLMs to simulate respondents with diverse mediators, the study identifies survey items that robustly measure intended traits, enabling cost-effective survey development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable survey item generation suited for LLMs has grown, with a critical challenge in ensuring the construct validity of generated items, traditionally requiring costly, large-scale human data collection.

Method: A framework for virtual respondent simulation using LLMs, accounting for mediators to identify survey items that robustly measure intended traits.

Result: The mediator generation methods and simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items across three psychological trait theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA).

Conclusion: LLMs can generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and simulate respondent behavior for item validation, opening a new direction for cost-effective survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like behavior.

Abstract: As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large
language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for
LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct
validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended
trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.
To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation
using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which
the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By
simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that
robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait
theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and
simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate
the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to
simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,
metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective
survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like
behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

Motivation: 知识编辑领域的研究越来越多，但评估方法是否稳健以及是否公平地偏袒某些编辑器仍未得到充分探索。此外，这些编辑器对整体模型能力的影响仍然是一个盲点。

Method: 通过实验评估不同的指标、评估方法和编辑批量大小对知识编辑器排名的影响，并手动评估基于字符串匹配的评估方法。

Result: 不同的指标和评估方法以及不同的编辑批量大小会导致知识编辑器排名的不同。基于字符串匹配的知识编辑评估方法存在产生假阳性匹配的倾向。

Conclusion: 选择不同的指标、评估方法和编辑批量大小会导致知识编辑器排名的不同。这种影响也体现在与知识编辑任务一起评估的通用语言理解任务中。基于字符串匹配的知识编辑评估方法存在产生假阳性匹配的倾向。

Abstract: Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years.
For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have
recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the
success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these
methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the
disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a
constant blind spot.
  We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics
and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to
a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect
also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge
editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching
based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently
released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.

TL;DR: 提出DAEDCMD用于持续多模态错误信息检测，缓解了知识遗忘和环境变化带来的挑战，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的多模态错误信息检测方法侧重于通过收集离线数据来监督检测器，但在现实场景中，新事件不断涌现，使得在离线数据上训练的多模态错误信息检测模型持续过时且无效。为了解决这个问题，在在线数据流下训练多模态错误信息检测模型成为一种选择，从而产生了一个名为持续多模态错误信息检测的新兴任务。不幸的是，它受到了两个主要挑战的阻碍：1）对新数据的训练持续降低了对过去数据的检测性能，称为过去知识遗忘；2）社会环境不断随时间演变，影响了对未来数据的泛化。

Method: 提出了一种新的持续多模态错误信息检测方法DAEDCMD，通过Dirichlet过程混合专家结构隔离事件特定参数的干扰来记住过去的知识，并通过学习连续时间动态模型来预测未来的环境分布。

Result: DAEDCMD可以持续且显著地优于包括六个多模态错误信息检测基线和三个持续学习方法在内的比较方法。

Conclusion: DAEDCMD在持续多模态错误信息检测中优于其他方法。

Abstract: Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely
spread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control
their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active
topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD
methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in
real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models
trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this
issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,
inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by
two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the
detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,
the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the
generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to
remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific
parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and
anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time
dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and
significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and
three continual learning methods.

TL;DR: This paper studies the problem of Chat-Ghosting, finding that statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning models for seen prefixes, while neural models like T5 and Phi-2 are better for unseen queries. Conversational context improves ghosting quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods.

Method: Experiment with various existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep learning methods, with and without dialog context. Propose a novel entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy.

Result: Statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality, especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT.

Conclusion: Statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models for seen prefixes. Neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results for unseen queries. Adding conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality, especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT.

Abstract: Ghosting, the ability to predict a user's intended text input for inline
query auto-completion, is an invaluable feature for modern search engines and
chat interfaces, greatly enhancing user experience. By suggesting completions
to incomplete queries (or prefixes), ghosting aids users with slow typing
speeds, disabilities, or limited language proficiency. Ghosting is a
challenging problem and has become more important with the ubiquitousness of
chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Despite the increasing
prominence of chat-based systems utilizing ghosting, this challenging problem
of Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research
community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance
analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this
through an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly
available dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and
two human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various
existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep
learning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel
entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that
statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in
terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For
unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding
conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality,
especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly

Motivation: To provide an open-source implementation of the FActScore framework, addressing the limitations of the original FActScore which relies on closed-source models, and to promote transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective evaluation of LLMs.

Method: Uses Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract factual claims and Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge source; enables the use of any Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV.

Result: Open models can approximate the performance of closed-source systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and the final setup obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments. Reports BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate for AFV.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs can approximate the performance of closed-source systems in factuality evaluation, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance. OpenFActScore achieves a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.

Abstract: We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore
framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language

using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and
Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge
source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial
models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any
Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed
technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and
modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source
LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting
BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our
results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source
systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup
obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.

Result: 与直接使用较小规模语言模型生成数据相比，该方法显著提高了模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了模型性能，并大大降低了与训练模型相关的碳排放。

Abstract: A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale
language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used
for model training.This method significantly reduces training costs by
eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still
faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the
risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues,
we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the
Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to
summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data.
Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a
smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large
amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results
show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared
to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.
Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the
task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the
model are greatly reduced.

Conclusion: in-context joint entity and relation extraction at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large language models

Abstract: Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity
and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings. In this paper, we
present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and
in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In
contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations
or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation
with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language
model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without
manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference
time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$
Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation
triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE
shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a
zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction
at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large
language models.

this work, we introduce a conditional multistage failure recovery framework
that employs zero-shot chain prompting. The framework is structured into four
error-handling stages, with three operating during task execution and one
functioning as a post-execution reflection phase. Our approach utilises the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to analyse execution challenges within their
environmental context and devise strategic solutions. We evaluate our method on
the TfD benchmark of the TEACH dataset and achieve state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming a baseline without error recovery by 11.5% and
surpassing the strongest existing model by 19%.

TL;DR: Data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score in LLMs, which can be used for Dataset Inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how to characterize memorization difficulty of training data in LLMs.

Method: Empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models, and case study of memorizing highly randomized strings.

Result: Data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score. Highly randomized strings exhibit unexpectedly low empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus.

Conclusion: Data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score, enabling Dataset Inference (DI).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training
data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In
this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the
domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training
data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models,
we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is
linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of
memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such
sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low
empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same
strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective
approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference
(DI).

*Nicholas Merchant,Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde,Andrei Cristian Popescu,Carlos Garcia Jurado Suarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过强制执行一致的标题结构，Re-LAION-Caption 19M 提高了文本到图像模型的对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成文本到图像的模型通常难以进行提示，因为像 LAION-5B 这样的大规模数据集具有嘈杂和非结构化的性质。这迫使用户严重依赖提示工程来引发所需的输出。

Method: 使用 Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next 模型生成遵循四部分模板（主题、设置、美学和相机细节）的标题。在结构化和随机打乱的标题上微调 PixArt-$\\Sigma$ 和 Stable Diffusion 2。

Result: Re-LAION-Caption 19M，一个高质量的 Re-LAION-5B 子集，包含 1900 万张 1024x1024 图像，标题由 Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next 模型生成。

Conclusion: 通过在训练期间强制执行一致的标题结构，可以显著提高模型的可控性和对齐性。使用结构化标题的版本始终在使用视觉问题回答 (VQA) 模型时产生更高的文本-图像对齐分数。

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt
adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like
LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit
desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption
structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and
alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of
Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by
a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part
template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune
PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly
shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher
text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The
dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: 我们提出了CorrDetail，一个用于可解释人脸伪造检测的视觉细节增强自校正框架，通过纠正伪造细节和整合视觉信息来提高检测精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，面部deepfake的广泛出现对安全领域构成了重大挑战，因此迫切需要有效的deepfake检测。现有的面部伪造检测技术可以大致分为两类：基于视觉的方法和多模态方法。前者通常缺乏对伪造细节的明确解释，而后者融合了视觉和语言模态，更容易出现幻觉问题。

Method: 我们引入了一个视觉细节增强的自校正框架CorrDetail，用于可解释的人脸伪造检测。CorrDetail经过精心设计，可以在提供错误引导的提问时纠正真实的伪造细节，旨在培养发现伪造细节的能力，而不是产生幻觉反应。此外，为了提高其发现的可靠性，还集成了一个视觉精细细节增强模块，为CorrDetail提供更精确的视觉伪造细节。最后，设计了一种融合决策策略，通过整合视觉信息补偿和减少模型偏差，进一步增强模型在处理极端样本时的区分能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，与最新的方法相比，CorrDetail不仅实现了最先进的性能，而且擅长准确识别伪造细节，同时展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrDetail不仅实现了最先进的性能，而且擅长准确识别伪造细节，同时展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread
emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of
security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake
detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be
categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal
approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,
while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone
to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for
interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to
rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,
with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than
yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of
its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,
supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a
fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's
discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of
visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results
demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying
forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

particularly on geometrically complex roadways like Type-S curved surfaces,
where standard RGB camera-based methods face limitations. This paper introduces
YOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework
specifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural
modifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally
efficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale
feature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an
Intelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the
network's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for
adaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive
evaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate
that YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%
mAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly
outperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains
real-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the synergistic
contribution of each integrated component. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training of existing virtual staining methods typically relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful signals.

Method: Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss and to calculate a Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware learning.

Result: Applied to a 3D benchmark dataset, Spotlight improves morphological representation while preserving pixel-level accuracy.

Conclusion: Spotlight improves morphological representation while preserving pixel-level accuracy, resulting in virtual stains better suited for downstream tasks such as segmentation and profiling.

Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with
transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and
fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining
combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence

Abstract: Food security remains a global concern as population grows and climate change
intensifies, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable agricultural
productivity. Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable
performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new
opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in
challenges related to agriculture-such as crop type mapping, crop phenology
estimation, and crop yield estimation-remains under-explored. In this work, we
quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their
effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an
agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an
ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare
existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically
evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific
tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model
tailored specifically to agriculture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving underwater image quality using deep learning.

Method: A deep learning-based approach integrating human subjective assessments into the training process, using a classifier network to distinguish between high- and low-quality images and GANs for enhancement.

Result: The GAN models' performance is evaluated using quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, UIQM) and qualitative analysis, demonstrating improvements in image quality.

Conclusion: The proposed model achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured underwater image quality, especially when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image sharpness.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have
significantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic
enhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based
approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective
assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly
available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either
high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to
distinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative
adversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to
refine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated
using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through
qualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model --
particularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image
sharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured
image quality.

TL;DR: pFedMMA是一种用于视觉语言任务的个性化联邦学习框架，它利用多模态适配器来实现个性化和泛化之间的最先进的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效地将像CLIP这样的视觉语言模型(VLMs)适应于分散的异构数据仍然是一个挑战。虽然提示调优已经成为个性化联邦学习中一种流行的参数高效方法，但现有的方法通常会牺牲泛化能力来换取个性化，尤其是在看不见的类或领域中。

Method: 利用多模态适配器的个性化联邦学习框架

Result: pFedMMA在包括领域和标签转移场景在内的11个数据集上进行了广泛的实验，表明pFedMMA在个性化和泛化之间实现了最先进的权衡，优于最近的联邦提示调整方法。

Conclusion: pFedMMA在个性化和泛化之间实现了最先进的权衡，优于最近的联邦提示调整方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to
decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has
emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated
learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of
personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this
work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework
that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter
contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally
shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization
strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions
while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global
generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared
component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across
eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that
pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and
generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code

TL;DR: LoongX is a hands-free image editing approach using brain-computer interfaces and generative models, achieving comparable or better performance than text-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image editing is labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or language abilities. The paper aims to create a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals.

Method: LoongX uses diffusion models trained on a dataset of image editing pairs with synchronized EEG, fNIRS, PPG, and head motion signals. It integrates a cross-scale state space (CS3) module and a dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module, and pre-trains the encoders using contrastive learning.

Result: LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549).

Conclusion: LoongX achieves comparable or better performance than text-driven methods in image editing by using neural signals, highlighting the potential of neural-driven generative models for accessible and intuitive image editing.

Abstract: Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it
labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or
language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing
approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes
state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928
image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography
(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography
(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address
the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The
cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific
features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these
features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics
via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train
the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic
intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I:
0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural
signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results
highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling
accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for
cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to
support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

TL;DR: Addresses challenges in 3D scene editing by using 2D diffusion editing for accurate region identification and inverse rendering for 3D localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D semantic parsing underperforms compared to 2D, making targeted 3D manipulations difficult and limiting edit fidelity.

Method: Leveraging 2D diffusion editing to identify modification regions, inverse rendering for 3D localization, refining the frontal view, and initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and depth maps from a 2D foundation model.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering up to a 4x speedup.

Conclusion: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significant speedup, offering a more efficient and effective approach to 3D scene local editing.

Abstract: Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the
entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in
the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a
series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering
enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies
in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D
counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and
limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion
editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by
inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and
initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived
from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an
iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural
details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective
approach to 3D scene local editing.

descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks.
ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we
train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving
remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's
spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and
cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances.
iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities,
generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts

TL;DR: Developed an AI-driven variable rate sprayer using deep learning for selective herbicide application, showing promising results in indoor trials by adjusting spray output based on canopy size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problems of uniform herbicide application in modern agriculture, such as increased input costs, environmental pollution, and herbicide-resistant weeds.

Method: The study developed a vision-guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system using YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep learning models on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, with an Arduino Uno-based relay interface for nozzle control. Indoor trials were conducted using potted plants to simulate weed scenarios, and system performance was validated using water-sensitive paper.

Result: The YOLO11n model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.98, precision of 0.99, and recall close to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. Water-sensitive paper validation showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones with canopy, with spray coverage increasing with canopy size.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of a real-time deep learning system with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide application, showing promising results in adjusting spray output based on canopy size.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes
to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of
herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision
guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed
presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation
in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep
learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,
and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated
nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted
using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to
simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean
average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close
to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision
of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water
sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones
where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%
for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,
respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based
on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining
real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide
application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to
include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus
tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed
by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn

Motivation: 目前诊断认知衰退的方法耗时且成本高昂，导致诊断不足。通过分析真实驾驶行为，提取与认知功能下降相关的“数字指纹”，可以更早地检测到认知衰退。

Method: 该框架使用大型视觉模型和自然驾驶视频来分析驾驶员行为，分类认知状态并预测疾病进展。

Conclusion: 该研究通过分析自然驾驶视频，利用大型视觉模型识别老年驾驶员的认知状态，旨在实现对认知衰退的早期检测和非侵入式监测。

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers
from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times,
cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly
nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior
captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital
fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of
MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights
from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive
decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic
driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and
predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between
real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status
of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our
method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to
proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and
supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to
mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the
aging population.

### [59] [Cloud Diffusion Part 1: Theory and Motivation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05496)
*Andrew Randono*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models use white noise, but natural images have scale invariance. Cloud Diffusion Model uses scale invariance instead of white noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: most natural image sets exhibit a type of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations

Method: incorporate scale invariant noise profiles into diffusion models in place of white noise

Result: These scale invariant noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model"

Conclusion: Cloud Diffusion Models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and greater controllability.

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise
to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise.
The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based
on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is
independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type
of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by
a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable
sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale
correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant
noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white
noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these
models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and
greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud
Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare
it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoomNet 是一种多视图扩散架构，可生成连贯的图像，并在图像质量和重建指标上优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单个图像生成一致的多视图图像仍然具有挑战性。缺乏空间一致性通常会降低表面重建中的 3D 网格质量。

Method: LoomNet，一种新颖的多视图扩散架构，通过并行多次应用相同的扩散模型来协同构建和利用共享潜在空间以实现视图一致性，从而生成连贯的图像。

Result: LoomNet 仅需 15 秒即可生成 16 个高质量且连贯的视图。

Conclusion: LoomNet在图像质量和重建指标上优于现有技术，并且可以通过相同的输入生成各种合理的新颖视图，从而展现出创造力。

Abstract: Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains
challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in
surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view
diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same
diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and
leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific
inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel
view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.
For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated
plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and
interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent
interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent
multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just
15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by
producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the
model's retrieval capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReLayout, a relation-CoT method, generates more reasonable and aesthetically coherent layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. It enhances layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions and introduces a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct layout styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout generation.

Method: We introduce ReLayout, a novel method that leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process.

Result: ReLayout outperforms baselines and can generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human aesthetics and more explainable.

Conclusion: ReLayout outperforms baselines and can generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human aesthetics and more explainable.

Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given
canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has
been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts
automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based
methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes
and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout
generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that
leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent
layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we
enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such
as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing
the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling
the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined
relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines
layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct

arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive
experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can
generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human
aesthetics and more explainable.

TL;DR: 提出CTNet用于多模态人脸反欺骗，通过学习跨模态特征转移和从RGB模态学习辅助模态来提高性能，尤其是在模态缺失和跨域泛化方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态人脸反欺骗（FAS）在训练和测试域之间存在更大的分布差异，并且在推理阶段面临模态不可用的挑战。活体人脸的模态内差异小于欺骗人脸，活体类别的跨模态特征转移比活体和欺骗类别之间更一致。

Method: 提出了一种新的跨模态转移引导网络（CTNet），通过学习一致和不一致的跨模态特征转移来区分真假人脸，并从RGB模态学习互补的红外和深度特征作为辅助模态，以解决模态缺失问题。

Result: CTNet在大多数协议中优于以往的双类多模态FAS方法。

Conclusion: CTNet在多模态人脸反欺骗任务中表现出色，优于以往的方法，尤其是在处理模态缺失和跨域泛化方面。

Abstract: Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by
extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB,
infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric
authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are
typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental
conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution
discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.
Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater
challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this
paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to
tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from
that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are
typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature
transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared
to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose
learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to
construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the
inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to
effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To
further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning
complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as
auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet
outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

TL;DR: Introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework (DSYM) for industrial quality inspection, achieving high precision with less labeled data compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms, suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness.

Method: a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination.

Result: Experimental results on the NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant advantages in data efficiency.

Conclusion: This research provides a high-precision, low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality inspection scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GSVR, a 2D Gaussian-based video representation that significantly improves decoding speed and reduces training time compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable or better performance in video interpolation and compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit neural representations for video have low decoding speed and long training time due to the high computation of convolutional networks.

Method: The paper proposes a 2D Gaussian-based video representation (GSVR) with a hybrid deformation field, a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing strategy, and quantization-aware fine-tuning.

Result: GSVR achieves 800+ FPS and 35+ PSNR on Bunny with a training time of 2 seconds per frame and demonstrates superior performance on Bunny and UVG datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed GSVR method achieves faster convergence, 10x faster decoding speed, comparable video interpolation performance, and better video compression performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and
promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to
improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding
speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing
methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video
representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds
per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose
GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS
and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.
Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of
the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and
the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object
motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing
strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)
based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion
and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to
avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to
compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the
Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than
existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other
methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task
to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

TL;DR: KDS是一种新的推理时间框架，通过引导样本远离伪像，并朝向更稳健、更高保真度的结构，从而提高图像修复的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型图像修复方法通常难以保证一致的保真度并产生不良伪像。

Method: 该论文介绍了一种新颖的推理时间框架，称为核密度引导（KDS），通过显式局部模式搜索来促进稳健、高保真度的输出。KDS采用扩散样本的N粒子集合，从它们的集体输出中计算patch-wise核密度估计梯度。这些梯度引导每个粒子中的patches朝向在集合内识别的共享、更高密度区域。

Result: 大量的数值验证表明，在具有挑战性的真实超分辨率和图像修复任务中，KDS显著提高了定量和定性性能。

Conclusion: KDS通过引导样本远离伪像，并朝向更稳健、更高保真度的结构，从而获得更好的质量样本，但计算成本更高。作为一个即插即用框架，KDS不需要重新训练或外部验证器，可以与各种扩散采样器无缝集成。

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods
often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address
this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time
framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local
mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,
computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective
outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,
higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local
mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from
spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model
imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows
us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by
simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS
requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with
various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS
substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on
challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

Motivation: 在虚拟和增强现实(VR/AR)中实现逼真的avatar动画一直具有挑战性，因为很难获得面部的ground truth状态。从头部安装相机(HMC)传感输入中获得同步图像在物理上是不可能的，HMC具有红外(IR)的部分观测，以及一系列外部穹顶相机，这些相机具有与avatar外观匹配的完整观测。先前依赖于综合分析方法的工作可以生成准确的ground truth，但由于其个性化训练中表达和风格之间的不完全分离而受到影响。对于同一对象，依赖于大量配对捕获(HMC和穹顶)使得收集大型数据集在操作上成本高昂，这些数据集不能用于不同的HMC视点和照明。

Method: 提出了一种新的生成方法，即生成HMC (GenHMC)，该方法利用大量未配对的HMC捕获，这些捕获更容易收集，以直接生成高质量的合成HMC图像，给定来自穹顶捕获的任何条件avatar状态。

Result: 通过评估合成HMC图像和从这些新的HMC-avatar对应关系训练的通用面部编码器，证明了这些突破，这些编码器实现了更好的数据效率和最先进的精度。

Conclusion: 该方法能够正确分离指定面部表情和视点的输入调节信号与面部外观，从而产生更准确的ground truth。

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground
truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images
from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations
in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full
observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on
analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer
from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their
personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)
for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale
datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In
this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),
that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,
to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning
avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly
disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and
viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.
Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the
reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both
evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these
new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and
state-of-the-art accuracy.

*Suoxiang Zhang,Xiaxi Li,Hongrui Chang,Zhuoyan Hou,Guoxin Wu,Ronghua Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptaGen is proposed to improve domain-specific image generation by addressing the limitations of current methods in semantic understanding and constraint incorporation, leading to better image quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing domain-specific image generation methods address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately, overlooking the dependence between semantic understanding and visual representation. They also inadequately incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints, leading to hallucinations and semantic deviations.

Method: The paper proposes AdaptaGen, a hierarchical semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt optimization with multi-perspective understanding. It also introduces a two-phase caption semantic transformation during the generation phase.

Result: AdaptaGen achieves significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and semantic consistency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper's experimental results confirm the effectiveness of AdaptaGen, demonstrating superior performance across 40 categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category. It achieves significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and semantic consistency.

Abstract: Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content
for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity.
However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current
approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately,
overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual
representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately
incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis,
resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic
deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical
semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt
optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive
semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate
hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation
mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables
preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across
images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation
during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while
enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to
domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's
effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40
categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category,
demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and
semantic consistency.

*Zhiwei Chen,Yupeng Hu,Zixu Li,Zhiheng Fu,Xuemeng Song,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method named OFFSET to address the limitations of composed image retrieval (CIR) by using a focus mapping-based feature extractor and a textually guided focus revision module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CIR remains in its nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation, and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias.

Method: This work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping. Subsequently, the authors propose a textually guided focus revision module.

Result: The proposed method achieves better performance on composed image retrieval.

Conclusion: The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated by comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is
capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It
enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a
modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding
the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its
nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and
noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,
and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is
overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two
limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which
consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.
It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide
the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact
of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus
revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the
text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby
enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features.
The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus
shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种结构知识引导的复杂扩散模型，用于PolSAR图像分类，该模型利用Contourlet变换并结合高频结构信息来指导扩散过程，从而提高边缘保持和分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的实值扩散模型在应用于PolSAR数据时，在捕获复值相位信息方面面临挑战。而且，这些模型通常难以保持精细的结构细节。

Method: 我们利用Contourlet变换，它提供了适用于PolSAR图像的丰富的多尺度和多方向表示。我们提出了一种在Contourlet域中用于PolSAR图像分类的结构知识引导的复杂扩散模型。具体来说，首先应用复杂Contourlet变换将数据分解为低频和高频子带，从而能够提取统计和边界特征。然后设计一个知识引导的复杂扩散网络来建模低频成分的统计特性。在此过程中，利用来自高频系数的结构信息来指导扩散过程，从而改善边缘保持。此外，联合学习多尺度和多方向高频特征，以进一步提高分类精度。

Result: 我们的方法超过了最先进的方法，特别是在保持边缘细节和保持复杂地形中的区域同质性方面。

Conclusion: 在三个真实世界的PolSAR数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的方法超过了最先进的方法，特别是在保持边缘细节和保持复杂地形中的区域同质性方面。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various
domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data
distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued
diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase
information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural
details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform,
which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited
for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion
model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically,
the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into
low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and
boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then
designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components.
During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is
utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation.
Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are
jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results
on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and
maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.

*Jiahui Wang,Qin Xu,Bo Jiang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的适配器变体方法（DRA），用于增强新类的泛化能力，通过动态分配adaptation ranks基于特征的重要性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示和基于适配器的工作在微调VLM方面取得了显著进展，但仍然面临着保持强大泛化能力的挑战，尤其是在面对未见过的新类时。这种限制部分是由于这些方法平等地对待图像和文本编码器的所有令牌，这可能导致对信息量较少的特征（例如，背景噪声、模板词）的过度拟合，并降低对新概念识别至关重要的通用表示。

Method: 提出了一种新的适配器变体方法，即动态秩适配（DRA），旨在增强新类的泛化能力。DRA根据训练期间特征的重要性动态地分配适配秩，以保留一般知识。DRA首先采用令牌重要性分组，使用序列注意力来评估令牌并按其重要性进行分组。然后，我们根据每个令牌组的重要性动态地采用秩适配，通过为更重要的令牌分配更高的特征秩。此外，我们设计了一种新的通道响应机制，以优先考虑对每个实例识别为信息量最大的特征通道的保留和适配。此外，还引入了L1正则化项以稳定训练。

Result: DRA在各种基准测试中，尤其是在提高新类的性能方面，优于现有方法，包括基本新类、跨数据集评估和域泛化。

Conclusion: DRA在各种基准测试中，尤其是在提高新类的性能方面，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate
impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based
works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the
challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards
unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating
all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting
on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and
degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept
recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a
novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class
generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the
importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first
employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and
group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to
the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature
ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response
mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels
identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1
regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA
over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on
various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and
domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is
received.

TL;DR: diffusion model-based framework for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as a single anomaly

Method: diffusion model-based framework for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain

Result: improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and brain labeling compared to traditional methods

Conclusion: demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis

Abstract: Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often
detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural
changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes
areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain
tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the
importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing
lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as
a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework
for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first
segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue
deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating
the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the
core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.
This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is
well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results
demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and
brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for
clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion
healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for
validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize
multiple lesioned brain images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GUI自动化中，一个关键的挑战是在不同的平台中精确地定位界面元素。现有的纯视觉GUI代理直接从庞大而杂乱的屏幕截图中定位元素，需要处理大量不相关的信息，从而影响了它们的准确性。此外，与已建立的诸如Intersection-over-Union (IoU)之类的目标检测指标相比，这些方法通常采用基本的交叉熵损失来学习定位目标，这未能有效地捕捉定位质量。

Method: 我们介绍了一种新的GUI grounding方法R-VLM，该方法利用放大的区域提议来实现精确的元素定位。我们还提出了一个IoU感知的目标函数，该函数有助于模型收敛到高IoU预测。

Result: R-VLM方法在GUI grounding的ScreenSpot和AgentStudio基准测试中，将最先进的grounding精度提高了13%。此外，在AITW和Mind2Web基准测试中，我们的R-VLM方法在GUI导航任务中显示出3.2-9.7%的绝对精度提升。

Abstract: Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by
advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI
automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse
platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large
and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant
information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches
typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives,
which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established
object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these
issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages
zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an
IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU
predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object
detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13%
across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and
AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy
improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

Conclusion: The MedGen model achieves leading performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems in visual quality and medical accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in
open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely
underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical
training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity
but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce
unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due
to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical

large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It
comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios,
providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation
models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading
performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across
multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing works ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new classes remains a significant challenge.

Method: We propose an Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across modalities. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty.

Result: ISP enables efficient information transfer while preserving feature stability and improves generalization ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings: base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization demonstrate the effectiveness of ISP.

Conclusion: The proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream
tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide
text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works
ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within

Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of

self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural
relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across

dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing
the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization
ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings:

Motivation: vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)虽然可以学习特定的空间或时间运动来驱动VDM与约束数据，但由于不稳定的融合和非线性可扩展性，实现对相机轨迹和物体运动的精确控制仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架LiON-LoRA，该框架通过线性可扩展性、正交性和范数一致性三个核心原则重新思考了LoRA融合。

Result: LiON-LoRA优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: LiON-LoRA在轨迹控制精度和运动强度调整方面优于现有方法，以最少的训练数据实现了卓越的泛化。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although
vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal
movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over
both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the
unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose
LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core
principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we
analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling
decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced
across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.
Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)
to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a
modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we
extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,
unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that
LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy
and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal
training data. Project Page: https://fuchengsu.github.io/lionlora.github.io/

TL;DR: This paper introduces a sensor fusion approach combining RGB and event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation, achieving robustness to harsh lighting conditions. A comprehensive dataset is released publicly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based pose estimation methods using RGB imaging sensors are challenged by harsh lighting conditions. Event sensors are more resilient but have limitations in spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.

Method: A RANSAC-based technique was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels, complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation.

Result: The event-RGB fusion method shows encouraging results on a comprehensive real dataset collected under challenging illumination conditions.

Conclusion: The event-RGB fusion approach is effective for spacecraft pose estimation and supports the usage of event sensors.

Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations,
such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose
estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling
solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting
conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,
blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic
or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,
event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced
signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work
addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion
approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to
achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique
was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to
achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The
pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme
conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of
RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under
a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further
supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support
community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像是包含数百个连续光谱带的高维数据集，可实现详细的材料和表面分析。高光谱异常检测 (HAD) 是指在没有关于高光谱场景或目标光谱的先验信息的情况下，识别和定位此类数据中异常目标的技术。近年来，这项技术取得了快速进展，在农业、国防、军事监视和环境监测领域都有应用。尽管取得了显著进展，但现有的 HAD 方法仍然面临着计算复杂度高、对噪声敏感以及在不同数据集上的泛化能力有限等挑战。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis.
Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying
and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a
hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid
advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence,
military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant
progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high
computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation
across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of
various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,
representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep
learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets
using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to
analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,
limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep
learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical
models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to
provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance

### [83] [SenseShift6D: Multimodal RGB-D Benchmarking for Robust 6D Pose Estimation across Environment and Sensor Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05751)
*Yegyu Han,Taegyoon Yoon,Dayeon Woo,Sojeong Kim,Hyung-Sin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SenseShift6D: a new dataset for 6D object-pose estimation that explores the impact of real-world sensor variations and demonstrates the effectiveness of test-time sensor control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SenseShift6D.

Method: SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures, 9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels. For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire 101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting permutations per object pose.

Result: Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even greater improvements.

Conclusion: SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive, self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain real-world environments.

depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate
such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,
9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.
For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire
101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting
permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our
dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater
performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance
comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data
quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is
effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even
greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from
data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive,
self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain
real-world environments. Our dataset is available at:

Method: 一种用于平衡白电平的全自动机制

Result: 该算法的结果已在一组 200 张显微图像上通过实验得到证实。图像包含pathomorphology中常用的三种显微镜标本的扫描结果。此外，将获得的结果与数码摄影中其他常用的白平衡算法进行了比较。

Conclusion: 该算法在苏木精- phloxine-藏红花染色和免疫组织化学染色图像中，比彩色摄影中使用的经典算法更有效。

Abstract: The acquisition of accurately coloured, balanced images in an optical
microscope can be a challenge even for experienced microscope operators. This
article presents an entirely automatic mechanism for balancing the white level
that allows the correction of the microscopic colour images adequately. The
results of the algorithm have been confirmed experimentally on a set of two
hundred microscopic images. The images contained scans of three microscopic
specimens commonly used in pathomorphology. Also, the results achieved were
compared with other commonly used white balance algorithms in digital
photography. The algorithm applied in this work is more effective than the
classical algorithms used in colour photography for microscopic images stained
with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron and for immunohistochemical staining images.

TL;DR: DreamArt: a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating articulated objects is a crucial yet challenging task. Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability.

Method: a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts.

Result: DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation.

Conclusion: DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

Abstract: Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial
yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.
Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture,
neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural
reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense
multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we
introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,
interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a
three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D
object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D
segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video
diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable
part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by
occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by
a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to
ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results
demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated

TL;DR: SPADE通过空间感知去噪网络解决了开放词汇全景场景图生成中视觉语言模型在空间关系推理方面的局限性，并在空间关系预测方面取得了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了视觉语言模型在空间关系推理中的固有局限性，例如难以区分对象相对位置，从而导致次优的关系预测。

Method: SPADE框架，包含：(1) 用于UNet适应的反演引导校准，以及 (2) 空间感知上下文推理。

Result: SPADE在基准PSG和Visual Genome数据集上进行了大量实验，证明SPADE优于现有技术方法。

Conclusion: SPADE在封闭和开放场景中均优于现有技术方法，尤其是在空间关系预测方面。

Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with
relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in
complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the
open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs
in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object
relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated
by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial
structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork)
framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two
key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2)
spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general
pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with
cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based
fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation
graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual
information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.
Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate
that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set
scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

TL;DR: The paper presents DREAM, an autoregressive model for document reconstruction, outperforming existing methods and achieving competitive results on subtasks. It also introduces a new dataset and evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from error propagation (multi-stage) or loss of layout information (generative models).

Method: The paper introduces an autoregressive model called DREAM for end-to-end document reconstruction.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on document reconstruction and competitive results on subtasks.

Conclusion: The paper's method achieves state-of-the-art performance in document reconstruction and is competitive across various subtasks.

Abstract: Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis
and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within
the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of
document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks,
subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction
format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies
are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to
extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions
in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the
information related to element layouts, which are vital for document
reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper
present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document
reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end
Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence
of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process,
encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition,
we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and
introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for
assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our
methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document
reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing
document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition,
formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is
competitive and compatible with various tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data, but real-world data acquisition is labor-intensive and limited by labeling cost, safety protocols, and scenario coverage. There is a gap in research regarding daytime variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels.

Method: The paper uses solar altitude as a global conditioning variable, readily computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, combined with a tailored normalization approach.

Result: The paper demonstrates the ability of the proposed method to accurately capture lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context of diffusion models.

Conclusion: This paper introduces the solar altitude as a global conditioning variable to address the gap in research regarding daytime variation in synthetic camera sensor data generation. It demonstrates the ability to accurately capture lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context of diffusion models.

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily
dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data
acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors
such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage.
Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic
camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime
variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently,
we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily
computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the
need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored
normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small
numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture
lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context
of diffusion models.

This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training of segmentation and completion networks, respectively.

Conclusion: OLG++ is more expressive than prior graph-based models for legal knowledge representation.

Abstract: We present OLG++, a semantic extension of the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG)
for modeling regulatory and legal rules in municipal and interjurisdictional
contexts. OLG++ introduces richer node and edge types, including spatial,
temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs, enabling
nuanced representations of legal obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies. The
model supports structured reasoning over rules with contextual conditions,
precedence, and complex triggers. We demonstrate its expressiveness through
examples from food business regulations, showing how OLG++ supports legal
question answering using property graph queries. OLG++ also improves over
LegalRuleML by providing native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints,
and reified exception structures. Our examples show that OLG++ is more

Abstract: Effectively evaluating deep research agents that autonomously search the web,

particularly when it comes to assessing long reports and giving detailed
feedback on their intermediate steps. To address these gaps, we introduce Deep
Research Comparator, a platform that offers a holistic framework for deep
research agent hosting, side-by-side comparison, fine-grained human feedback
collection, and ranking calculation. Given a user query, our platform displays
the final reports from two different agents along with their intermediate steps
during generation. Annotators can evaluate the overall quality of final reports
based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately
by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report.
Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This
scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various
large language models to transform them into deep research agents for
evaluation. To demonstrate the platform's utility for deep research agent
development, we have collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on
three deep research agents. A demo video of our platform can be found at

Abstract: The second edition of the 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge, co-organized
by researchers from Microsoft, Stanford University, and the Hospital Clinic of
Barcelona, focuses on multimodal dermatology question answering and
segmentation, using real-world patient queries and images. This work addresses
the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select
the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both
user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed
approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal
models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2)
introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates
between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic
retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information
from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to
fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a
submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high
accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical
challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made
asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.
By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when
evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more
reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a comprehensive framework operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system red teaming and micro-level model red teaming. It emphasizes that effective AI red teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments.

Method: We propose a comprehensive framework operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further propose a set of recommendations.

Result: there exists a significant gap between red teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI.

Conclusion: Effective AI red teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a
widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a
critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its
current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red
teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus
on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI
red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities
while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors
that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments.
To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework
operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system
red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model
red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further
propose a set of recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red
teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic
vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用LLM生成counterfactual explanations (CFs)，结果表明，它增强了解释性，并在临床和生理预测任务中提高了鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFs可以作为异常预防的干预手段和训练鲁棒模型的增强数据。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLM），特别是GPT-4o-mini，在零样本和三样本设置中生成CFs。

Result: 与DiCE、CFNOW和NICE等传统方法相比，基于LLM的方法实现了高合理性（高达99%），强有效性（高达0.99）和有竞争力的稀疏性。

Conclusion: 利用LLM生成的CFs作为增强样本可以提高下游分类器的性能，尤其是在低数据情况下。这证明了基于prompt的生成技术在增强临床和生理预测任务中的可解释性和鲁棒性的潜力。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine
learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an
outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality
prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we
explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating
CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two
datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public
dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as
DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high
plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive
sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves
downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially
in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative
techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and
physiological prediction tasks. Code base: github.com/anonymous/SenseCF.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SingLoRA improves LoRA by reformulating low-rank adaptation, leading to more stable training, fewer parameters, and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scale disparities between LoRA matrices cause unstable training dynamics and suboptimal performance.

Method: SingLoRA reformulates low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose.

Result: SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy on MNLI (surpassing LoRA and LoRA+) with 60% of their parameter budget and improves image fidelity on DreamBooth with a DINO similarity score of 0.151 (compared to DoRA and LoRA).

Conclusion: SingLoRA achieves better performance with fewer parameters and more stable training compared to LoRA and DoRA.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights
of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a
low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities
between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates
low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a
single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design
inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,
and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the
infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable
feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks
validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on
MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+
(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,
fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image
fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to
scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

Abstract: We motivate and outline a programme for a formal theory of measurement of
artificial intelligence. We argue that formalising measurement for AI will
allow researchers, practitioners, and regulators to: (i) make comparisons
between systems and the evaluation methods applied to them; (ii) connect
frontier AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques
drawn from engineering and safety science; and (iii) foreground how what counts
as AI capability is contingent upon the measurement operations and scales we
elect to use. We sketch a layered measurement stack, distinguish direct from
indirect observables, and signpost how these ingredients provide a pathway
toward a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

*Wei Zhang,Juan Chen,En Zhu,Wenhong Cheng,YunPeng Li,Yanbo J. Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MLlm-DR, a multimodal LLM for explainable depression diagnosis using interview data. It outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous automated depression diagnosis studies lack clear explanations of how depression scores were determined. Current LLMs capable of processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor diagnostic performance.

Method: The paper proposes a novel multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former). The smaller LLMs generates depression scores and rationales, and the LQ-former captures depression-related features from speech and visual data.

Result: MLlm-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on two interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ.

Conclusion: The proposed MLlm-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from
interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies
often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting
their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a
possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of
processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor
diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal
information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR
integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former).
Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and
corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for
domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust
training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures
depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's
ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression
diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two
interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) are opening up new
opportunities in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. While
general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in
geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are
increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents
the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical
engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical
domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation,
domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the
state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including
geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design
calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational
tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted
LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this
interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for
practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also
providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic
community.

Abstract: The lack of transparency of data-driven Artificial Intelligence techniques
limits their interpretability and acceptance into healthcare decision-making
processes. We propose an attribution-based approach to improve the
interpretability of Explainable AI-based predictions in the specific context of
arm lymphedema's risk assessment after lymph nodal radiotherapy in breast
cancer. The proposed method performs a statistical analysis of the attributes
in the rule-based prediction model using standard metrics from Information
Retrieval techniques. This analysis computes the relevance of each attribute to
the prediction and provides users with interpretable information about the
impact of risk factors. The results of a user study that compared the output
generated by the proposed approach with the raw output of the Explainable AI
model suggested higher levels of interpretability and usefulness in the context
of predicting lymphedema risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感和意图识别对于自动人机交互至关重要。一个重要的挑战是由于传感器故障或数据不完整而导致的模态缺失。

Method: 引入了一种基于注意力的扩散模型，用于缺失模态特征补全(ADMC)。

Result: 基于注意力的扩散网络(ADN)生成的缺失模态特征与真实的多模态分布紧密对齐，从而提高了所有缺失模态场景的性能。此外，ADN的跨模态生成甚至在全模态上下文中也提供了改进的识别。

Conclusion: 在IEMOCAP和MIntRec基准测试中实现了最先进的结果，证明了其在缺失和完整模态场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated
human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual
information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant
challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete
data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often
suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to
suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based
Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework
independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving
their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based
Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align
with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all
missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers
improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating
its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM生成的检索练习可以有效提高学生知识保留率，但教师需要审核题目质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索练习是一种公认的教学技术，已知可以显著提高学生的学习和知识保留。然而，生成高质量的检索练习题通常对教师来说既耗时又费力，尤其是在快速发展的技术科目中。大型语言模型 (LLM) 有可能通过响应提示来自动执行此过程，但 LLM 生成的检索练习对学生学习的有效性仍有待确定。

Method: 在一项涉及两门大学级别数据科学课程的实证研究中，大约有 60 名学生。我们比较了学生接受 LLM 生成的多项选择检索练习题的一周与未提供此类问题的一周的学习成果。

Result: 接触 LLM 生成的检索练习的学生获得了明显更高的知识保留率，平均准确率为 89%，而没有此类练习的一周为 73%。

Conclusion: LLM生成的检索练习可以有效地支持学生的学习，并可能为将检索练习整合到实时教学中提供可扩展的解决方案。但需要注意的是，LLM生成问题的质量可能会有所不同，教师仍然必须在将生成的问题发布给学生之前手动验证和修改。

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to
significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However,
generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming
and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical
subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this
process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness
of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be
established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two
college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared
learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated
multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no
such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to
LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge
retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without
such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions
can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution
for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite
these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions
must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors
must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing
them to students.

Motivation: 社交媒体和生成式人工智能的指数级增长改变了信息传播，在促进连接的同时，也加速了错误信息的传播。理解信息传播动态和开发有效的控制策略对于减轻有害内容至关重要。

Method: 我们引入了一个基于 LLM 的模拟环境，捕捉了代理不断演变的的态度、情绪和反应。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了基于社会信息处理的思维链 (SIP-CoT) 机制，并通过情感引导的记忆来增强。

Result: 实验结果证实，经过 SIP-CoT 增强的 LLM 代理能够更有效地处理社会信息，表现出更接近真实人类互动的行为、态度和情绪。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了当前基于 LLM 的传播模拟的关键局限性，并展示了整合 SIP-CoT 和情感记忆如何显著提高 LLM 代理的社交智能和真实感。

Abstract: The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed
information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the
spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and
developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful
content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but
inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods,
including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but
typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language
models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for
simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an
LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes,
emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant
gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially
in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through
Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in
goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional
processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the
Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism
enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of
social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental
results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process
social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to
real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical
limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how
integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social
intelligence and realism of LLM agents.

Motivation: 经济数据可能容易被操纵，从而使预测不太可靠。为了解决这个问题，我们尝试利用大规模的司法数据，这些数据反映了影响当地投资安全和回报的司法绩效，用于城市层面的FDI预测。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于司法数据的表格学习方法（TLJD），用于城市层面的FDI预测。TLJD集成了行数据和列数据，用于司法绩效指标编码，并利用混合专家模型来调整不同指标的权重，考虑区域差异。

Result: TLJD在不同的评估指标上优于其他十个最先进的基线（至少达到0.92 R2）。

Conclusion: TLJD在城市层面FDI预测中优于其他方法，R2至少达到0.92

Abstract: To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting
sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct
investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and
fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for
local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP).
However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions
less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial
data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security
and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an
index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million
publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset
is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data
(TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data
in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and
utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different
indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of
TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.
Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach
to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different
evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 人类和AI对AI生成的治疗方案的评价存在显著差异，强调了在临床护理中整合AI的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能扩展到诊断之外，评估人工智能生成的治疗方案是一个关键的挑战，特别是对于新的推理模型。本研究比较了人类专家和两种人工智能模型（一种是通用模型，一种是推理模型）的方案，并由人类同行和一个高级人工智能评判员进行评估。

Method: 十名皮肤科医生、一个通用人工智能（GPT-4o）和一个推理人工智能（o3）为五个复杂的皮肤科病例生成治疗方案。匿名、规范化的方案分两个阶段进行评分：1）由十名人类专家评分，2）由一个高级人工智能评判员（Gemini 2.5 Pro）使用相同的评分标准评分。

Result: 观察到一个深刻的“评估者效应”。人类专家对同行生成的方案的评分明显高于人工智能方案（平均7.62 vs. 7.16；p=0.0313），将GPT-4o排名第6（平均7.38），推理模型o3排名第11（平均6.97）。相反，人工智能评判员得出了完全相反的结论，对人工智能方案的评分明显高于人类方案（平均7.75 vs. 6.79；p=0.0313）。它将o3排名第一（平均8.20），GPT-4o排名第二，将所有人类专家排名较低。

Conclusion: 临床方案的感知质量从根本上取决于评估者的性质。一种被人类专家评价不佳的先进推理AI，被一种复杂的AI评判为优越，揭示了基于经验的临床启发式和数据驱动的算法逻辑之间的深刻差距。这种悖论为人工智能的整合提出了一个关键的挑战，表明未来需要协同的、可解释的人工智能系统，以弥合这一推理差距，从而增强临床护理。

Abstract: Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI
expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study
compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a
reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.
  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI
(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The
anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human
experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical
rubric.
  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored
peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;
p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th
(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI
plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It
ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.
  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally
dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by
human experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep
gap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic
logic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration,
suggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that
bridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care.

*Lukas Kuhn,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent, identifies failure modes in AI models deployed in clinical settings, offering targeted recommendations that improve performance under real-world distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models in clinical practice can fail catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging. Practitioners lack accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.

Method: introducing ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent, clinically relevant distribution shifts.

Result: ModelAuditor is able correctly identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models. Its targeted recommendations recover 15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods. These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

Conclusion: ModelAuditor can correctly identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models and its targeted recommendations recover 15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift.

Abstract: The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:
models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail
catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.
Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,
but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases
before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack
accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.
Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with
users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,
clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates
interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during
deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root
causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three
real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in
histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity
in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly
identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the
established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover
15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially
outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.
These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute
on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时监测电池的健康状态（SoH）仍然是一个主要的挑战，特别是在运行约束限制了传统方法的微电网中。

Method: 一种基于充电阶段结束时放电脉冲分析的创新方法。

Result: 在使用容量衰减约为 85% 的两个电池的参数进行训练后，我们成功地预测了另外两个循环至大约 90% SoH 的电池的衰减，在最坏的情况下，平均绝对误差约为 1%，并且估计器的可解释性得分接近 0.9。

Conclusion: 该方法如果性能得到证实，可以很容易地集成到电池管理系统中，并为持续运行下的优化电池管理铺平道路。

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a
major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit
the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an
innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the
charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the
voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are
then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far,
the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After
training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of
around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries,
cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1%
in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9.
If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into
battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery
management under continuous operation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces GTA1, a GUI agent that uses test-time scaling and reinforcement learning to improve task planning and action grounding, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. Code and models are open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses two main challenges in GUI agents: resolving ambiguity in task planning (i.e., the action proposal sequence) and accurately grounding actions in complex and high-resolution interfaces.

Method: The paper introduces a test-time scaling method to select the most appropriate action proposal by sampling multiple candidates and using a judge model for evaluation. It also proposes a model that improves accuracy in grounding the selected action proposal to its corresponding visual elements, leveraging reinforcement learning for visual grounding through objective alignments.

Result: GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7% accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. With the test-time scaling strategy, it achieves 45.2% task success rate on OSWorld.

Conclusion: The paper's method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, such as 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7% accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When paired with a planner applying the test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on OSWorld). The code and models are open-sourced.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms
(e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements.
Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action
proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each
action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.
However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning
(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is
non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in
complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual
targets.
  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI
Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate
action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we
sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to
evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better
decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and
improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves
improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its
corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning
(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,
rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.
  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%
accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When
paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits
state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on
OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在预测早产儿视网膜病变(ROP)风险方面的能力在很大程度上未被探索。

Method: 提出Affective-ROPTester，一个自动化评估框架，包含Instruction-based, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), 和 In-Context Learning (ICL) 三种prompting策略，并整合情感元素。

Result: LLMs在ROP风险预测中仅依赖内在知识效果有限，但若加入外部输入则表现提升。模型输出中存在情感偏差，倾向于高估中高风险案例。相比于负面情绪，积极情感框架有助于缓解模型输出中的预测偏差。

Conclusion: LLMs在ROP风险预测中仅依赖内在知识效果有限，但若加入外部输入则表现提升。模型输出中存在情感偏差，倾向于高估中高风险案例。积极情感框架有助于缓解预测偏差。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and
mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

Conclusion: This paper introduces CogniPlay, a work-in-progress model for General Game Playing (GGP) based on findings from cognitive psychology and previous efforts to model human-like behavior in artificial agents.

Abstract: While AI systems have equaled or surpassed human performance in a wide
variety of games such as Chess, Go, or Dota 2, describing these systems as
truly "human-like" remains far-fetched. Despite their success, they fail to
replicate the pattern-based, intuitive decision-making processes observed in
human cognition. This paper presents an overview of findings from cognitive
psychology and previous efforts to model human-like behavior in artificial
agents, discusses their applicability to General Game Playing (GGP) and
introduces our work-in-progress model based on these observations: CogniPlay.

Motivation: The current practice for constructing neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning.

Method: Proposes Neurosymbolic Transition Systems, a model where symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate over symbols and intuition in parallel.

Conclusion: This paper proposes Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a computational model for building neurosymbolic AR tools, which can scale logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong guarantees of symbolic algorithms.

Abstract: There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers,
and other Automated Reasoning (AR) tools by combining traditional symbolic
algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, the current
practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc
programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional
symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I
propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model
that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this
model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate
over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale
logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong
guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model
I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

TL;DR: Addresses task-specific difficulties in time series forecasting by decomposing the pipeline into three stages and investigating architectural configurations, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting is challenging due to the need for effective sequence representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Each dataset/configuration is a distinct task with unique challenges.

Method: Decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three stages: input sequence representation, information extraction/memory construction, and final target projection; investigates architectural configurations within each stage.

Result: Models achieve state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and greatly enhance computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy with enhanced computational efficiency (reduced training/inference times, lower parameter count).

Abstract: With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant
advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence
representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time
series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence
representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future
projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct
task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate
predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this
work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages:
input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction,
and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of
architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules,
such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention
mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks,
including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational
efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter
count. The source code is available at

Motivation: 探索音乐语言模型(如MU-LLaMA)是否可以执行类似于音乐场景想象(MSI)的任务，该任务需要来自视频和音乐的跨模态信息进行训练。为了改进现有的仅关注音乐元素的音乐字幕模型，我们引入MusiScene，一个旨在想象与音乐互补的场景的音乐字幕模型。

Conclusion: MusiScene在生成上下文相关的标题方面比MU-LLaMA更强大。利用生成的MSI标题来增强文本的视频背景音乐生成(VBMG)。

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of
generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the
generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from
text.

Result: BlueLM-2.5-3B在仅有29亿参数的情况下，实现了卓越的多模态能力，同时保持了具有竞争力的纯文本性能。在多模态和纯文本基准测试中进行了全面的评估。BlueLM-2.5-3B具有卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: BlueLM-2.5-3B在思考模式下，文本基准测试中能达到Qwen3-4B的水平，多模态评估中仅落后Kimi-VL-A3B-16B约5%。在非思考模式下，优于Qwen2.5-VL-3B。BlueLM-2.5-3B具有卓越的数据效率。

Abstract: We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering
strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and
non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token
budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data
resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance
training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while
preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters.
We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and
text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable
performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger
Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In
non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal
benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency.
All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total
training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to
the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful
insights to the research community.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个用于无线网络中多任务预测的统一基础模型，该模型在未见场景中表现出强大的泛化能力，并在新任务上实现了超越传统全样本基线的零样本性能。

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication
networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state
information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for
a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer
tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely
applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across
different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation
model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse
prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to
unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses
a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we
introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input
lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model
demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot
performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

Method: 开发了一个名为HopeBot的聊天机器人，它使用检索增强生成和实时澄清来管理PHQ-9。

Result: 在英国和中国的132名成年人完成的受试者内研究中，分数表现出很强的一致性（ICC = 0.91；45%相同）。在75名提供比较反馈的参与者中，71%的人表示更信任聊天机器人，突出了更清晰的结构、解释性指导和支持性语气。总体而言，87.1%的人表示愿意重复使用或推荐HopeBot。

Conclusion: 语音LLM聊天机器人可以作为常规抑郁症筛查的可扩展、低负担的辅助工具。

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively
screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the
PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a
within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both
self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement
(ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative
feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer
structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)
were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,
and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by
employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,
87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings
demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge
at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access.
Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct

challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward
signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding
intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our
method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task
objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves
state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench,
outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT
CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a
significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and
efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs
(40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable
Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of
5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a
positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each
annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these

faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN
explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that
better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing
feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter
clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward
more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address
the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

### [125] [On Lockean beliefs that are deductively closed and minimal change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06042)
*Tommaso Flaminio,Lluis Godo,Ramón Pino Pérez,Lluis Subirana*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue that Lockean belief sets are not closed under logical deduction. It provides characterizations of belief sets closed under deduction and proposes a probabilistic update approach for minimal revision of beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lockean belief sets are not generally closed under (classical) logical deduction

Method: we propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal revision of those beliefs

Result: we provide two characterizations of those belief sets that are closed under classical logic deduction

Conclusion: we can deductively close a belief set via a minimal revision

Abstract: Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is
defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in
probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding
some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for
instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not
generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present
paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief
sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we
propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal
revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest
possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new
information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set
via a minimal revision.

TL;DR: FEVO 是一个多阶段增强框架，旨在增强 LLM 在金融领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的推理能力取得了进步，从而显著提高了 LLM 在数学和编程等各个领域的性能。然而，将这些进步应用于金融领域的研究仍然有限，在金融领域中，完成任务需要大量的领域特定知识。

Method: 使用持续预训练 (CPT) 扩展金融领域知识，使用监督微调 (SFT) 灌输结构化、精细的推理模式，并使用强化学习 (RL) 进一步整合扩展的金融领域知识与学习的结构化推理。

Result: FEVO-R32B 在五个金融基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，优于更大的模型和专业模型。

Conclusion: FEVO-R32B在五个金融基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，优于更大的模型和专业模型。FEVO-R32B 的性能明显优于 FEVO-R32B-0，验证了金融领域知识扩展和结构化逻辑推理提炼的有效性。

Abstract: Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to
significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as
mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the
financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to
complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO
(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance
LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM
performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain
knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate
reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the
expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To
ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models
and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets
specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our
framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from
Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and
general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger
models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates
markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge
expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于人工智能的框架，该框架结合了 LSTM、GA 和 SHAP，用于医疗保健能源管理，结果表明 LSTM 明显优于 ARIMA 和 Prophet 模型，为提高能源效率和可持续性提供了一个强大的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗机构中有效能源管理的迫切需求，因为医疗机构的需求波动挑战着运营效率和可持续性。传统方法通常被证明是不够的，导致效率低下和成本增加。

Method: 基于人工智能的框架，结合了长短期记忆 (LSTM)、遗传算法 (GA) 和 SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)，专为医疗保健能源管理而设计。

Result: LSTM 在预测复杂的非线性需求模式方面明显优于 ARIMA 和 Prophet 模型。LSTM 实现了 21.69 的平均绝对误差 (MAE) 和 29.96 的均方根误差 (RMSE)，远好于 Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) 和 ARIMA (MAE: 87.73, RMSE: 125.22)，展示了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 集成的 LSTM-GA-SHAP 方法为提高预测准确性、提高能源效率和促进医疗机构的可持续性提供了一个强大的解决方案。该研究为在医疗保健能源管理中使用人工智能奠定了坚实的基础，突出了其可扩展性、效率和弹性潜力。

Abstract: This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in
healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational
efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate,
causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an
AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm
(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for
healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series
forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains
underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and
Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:
87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm
is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,
enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis
further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different
features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This
integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving
forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability
in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and
hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall,
the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy
management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

TL;DR: OpenAgentSafety is introduced to evaluate the safety of AI agents interacting with real tools across various tasks. Empirical analysis reveals significant unsafe behaviors in prominent LLMs, highlighting the need for stronger safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool abstractions.

Method: OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories. It combines rule-based analysis with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.

Result: Unsafe behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7% with o3-mini

Conclusion: Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7% with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from
scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings,
but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While
prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by
relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool
abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular
framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories.
Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real
tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash
shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user
tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is
designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,
and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis
with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.
Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe

*Scott Geng,Hamish Ivison,Chun-Liang Li,Maarten Sap,Jerry Li,Ranjay Krishna,Pang Wei Koh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过配对弱数据点的偏好数据进行训练，可以显著提升模型性能，达到甚至超越使用强监督数据的模型效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进语言模型的关键在于提高训练数据的质量，但在强监督数据稀缺时会受到限制。

Method: 配对由小型3B模型和更小1.5B模型生成的响应偏好数据，对8B模型进行后训练。

Result: 在logistic回归中证明了两个弱教师模型之间的性能差距为改进更强的学生模型提供了有用的信号。在标准11基准评估套件上，该方法与当前最优模型Tulu 3的性能相匹配。

Conclusion: 通过配对偏好数据，即使在弱监督数据微调效果不佳的情况下，也能实现超越个体数据点的收益。在标准评估套件上，该方法与依赖更强监督者的先进模型性能相匹配。Delta learning为先进的后训练提供了更简单、更经济的开放方法。

Abstract: Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of
the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is
scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of
individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each
individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain
this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points
suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised
finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled
experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data
generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even
smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard
11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the
performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base
model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta
learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art
post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic
regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides
useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that
models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be
considered weak.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从观察数据中识别治疗效果通常需要假设一个完全指定的因果图。然而，这种图在实践中很少见，尤其是在复杂或高维的环境中。

Method: 本文考虑形式化为因果图集合的因果抽象，并侧重于此类集合中因果查询的可识别性。

Result: 本文介绍并形式化了此设置下的几个可识别性标准。

Conclusion: 本文将这些标准组织成一个结构化的层次结构，突出了它们之间的关系。这种分层视图能够更清楚地了解在不同层次的因果知识下可以识别什么。

Abstract: Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically
requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are
rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings.
To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal
abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information.
In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of
causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such
collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under
this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a
structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view
enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels
of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the
literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal
knowledge is unavailable.

### [131] [Aligned Textual Scoring Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06221)
*Yuxuan Lu,Yifan Wu,Jason Hartline,Michael J. Curry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Aligned Scoring Rule (ASR) to better align text scoring with human preferences while ensuring properness, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wu and Hartline (2024) proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical (i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are well aligned with human preference over text.

Method: The paper designs the Aligned Scoring Rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score).

Result: ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with human preference while maintaining properness.

Conclusion: The paper designs the Aligned Scoring Rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). The experiments show that ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with human preference while maintaining properness.

Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by
scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper
if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the
expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024)
proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical
(i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable
properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are
well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned
Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error
between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our
experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with
human preference while maintaining properness.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: LLMs are evaluated on PBE tasks for tabular data, showing strengths in diverse formats but weaknesses in ambiguous tasks; a hybrid approach improves results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It remains unclear how well LLMs perform on Programming by Example (PBE) tasks, especially those involving tabular data transformations.

Method: Evaluate LLMs on PBE tasks involving tabular data transformations, using different prompting strategies and comparing performance with and without PBE-specific knowledge. A hybrid method combining LLMs with a traditional PBE solver is also proposed.

Result: LLMs support more diverse input formats and achieve higher accuracy than conventional methods, but struggle with tasks that contain ambiguity. The hybrid approach improves overall success.

Conclusion: LLMs outperform conventional methods in PBE tasks with diverse input formats but struggle with ambiguity. A hybrid approach improves overall success.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate code from natural language
descriptions. Their performance is typically evaluated using programming
benchmarks that simulate real-world tasks. These benchmarks provide
specifications in the form of docstrings, function signatures, or bug reports.
The model then generates a program, which is tested against predefined test
cases. In contrast, Programming by Example (PBE) uses input-output examples as
the specification. Traditional PBE systems rely on search-based methods over
restricted transformation spaces. They are usually designed for narrow domains
and fixed input formats. It remains unclear how well LLMs perform on PBE tasks.
  In this work, we evaluate LLMs on PBE tasks involving tabular data
transformations. We prompt models to generate functions that convert an input
table to an output table. We test the generated functions on unseen inputs to
measure accuracy. Our study includes multiple LLMs and evaluates different
prompting strategies, such as one-shot vs. multi-try. We also compare
performance with and without PBE-specific knowledge. Finally, we propose a
hybrid method that calls a traditional PBE solver first, and then falls back to
LLMs if necessary. Our results show that LLMs support more diverse input
formats and achieve higher accuracy than conventional methods. However, they
struggle with tasks that contain ambiguity. The hybrid approach improves
overall success by combining the strengths of both approaches.

TL;DR: GTRSS 是一种新的基于图的框架，用于 top-k 子轨迹搜索，它通过构建双层图索引和使用数据轨迹相似性度量来提高效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于代价高昂的过滤-验证框架，导致响应时间缓慢。本文解决了 Top-k 代表性相似子轨迹查询 (TRSSQ) 问题，该问题旨在找到与查询最相似的 k 个最具代表性的子轨迹。

Method: 我们提出了 GTRSS，这是一个新的基于图的 Top-k 代表性相似子轨迹查询框架。在离线阶段，GTRSS 构建了一个双层图索引，该索引对包含相似代表性子轨迹的轨迹进行聚类。在在线阶段，它通过将图导航到与查询相关的集群来有效地检索结果，从而绕过完整的数据集扫描和繁重的计算。为了支持这一点，我们引入了数据轨迹相似性度量 (DTSM) 来衡量最相似的子轨迹对。我们进一步将 R 树和网格过滤与 DTSM 剪枝规则相结合，以加速索引构建。

Result: GTRSS的检索准确率超过 90%，查询性能提高了两个数量级。

Conclusion: GTRSS显著提高了效率和准确性，检索准确率超过 90%，查询性能提高了两个数量级。

Abstract: Trajectory mining has attracted significant attention. This paper addresses
the Top-k Representative Similar Subtrajectory Query (TRSSQ) problem, which
aims to find the k most representative subtrajectories similar to a query.
Existing methods rely on costly filtering-validation frameworks, resulting in
slow response times. Addressing this, we propose GTRSS, a novel Graph-based
Top-k Representative Similar Subtrajectory Query framework. During the offline
phase, GTRSS builds a dual-layer graph index that clusters trajectories
containing similar representative subtrajectories. In the online phase, it
efficiently retrieves results by navigating the graph toward query-relevant
clusters, bypassing full-dataset scanning and heavy computation. To support
this, we introduce the Data Trajectory Similarity Metric (DTSM) to measure the
most similar subtrajectory pair. We further combine R-tree and grid filtering
with DTSM pruning rules to speed up index building. To the best of our
knowledge, GTRSS is the first graph-based solution for top-k subtrajectory
search. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that GTRSS significantly
enhances both efficiency and accuracy, achieving a retrieval accuracy of over
90 percent and up to two orders of magnitude speedup in query performance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）发展迅速，因此始终如一地提示它们是一个挑战。这导致不一致和不可预测的应用程序行为，从而削弱了企业对关键任务工作流程所需的可靠性。

Method: 引入了prompt迁移的概念，作为在不断变化的LLM中稳定GenAI应用程序的系统方法。使用Tursio企业搜索应用程序作为案例研究，分析了连续GPT模型升级的影响，详细介绍了包括prompt重新设计和迁移测试平台在内的迁移框架，并展示了这些技术如何恢复应用程序的一致性。

Result: 结果表明，结构化的prompt迁移可以完全恢复因模型漂移而丧失的应用程序可靠性。

Conclusion: 结构化的prompt迁移可以完全恢复因模型漂移而丧失的应用程序可靠性。总结了实践经验，强调了prompt生命周期管理和可靠测试对于确保可靠的GenAI驱动的业务应用程序的必要性。

Abstract: Generative AI is transforming business applications by enabling natural
language interfaces and intelligent automation. However, the underlying large
language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly and so prompting them consistently
is a challenge. This leads to inconsistent and unpredictable application
behavior, undermining the reliability that businesses require for
mission-critical workflows. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prompt
migration as a systematic approach to stabilizing GenAI applications amid
changing LLMs. Using the Tursio enterprise search application as a case study,
we analyze the impact of successive GPT model upgrades, detail our migration
framework including prompt redesign and a migration testbed, and demonstrate
how these techniques restore application consistency. Our results show that
structured prompt migration can fully recover the application reliability that
was lost due to model drift. We conclude with practical lessons learned,
emphasizing the need for prompt lifecycle management and robust testing to
ensure dependable GenAI-powered business applications.

Result: requirements for such a benchmark suite, discuss domain-specific challenges, and sketch-out the architecture of a modular benchmarking suite

Conclusion: an application-centric benchmark suite for spatiotemporal database systems is urgently needed

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data play a key role for mobility-based applications and are
their produced volume is growing continuously, among others, due to the
increased availability of IoT devices.
  When working with spatiotemporal data, developers rely on spatiotemporal
database systems such as PostGIS or MobilityDB.
  For better understanding their quality of service behavior and then choosing
the best system, benchmarking is the go-to approach.
  Unfortunately, existing work in this field studies only small isolated

TL;DR: This paper introduces a serverless approach to improve the scalability of spatiotemporal data processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems have limited support for big spatiotemporal data scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes breaking down queries into small subqueries and leveraging Function-as-a-Service platforms for parallel execution.

Result: The proposed approach leverages the near-instant scaling of Function-as-a-Service platforms to execute subqueries in parallel.

Conclusion: This paper partially solves the scalability needs of big spatiotemporal data processing by using a native serverless data processing approach.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data are being produced in continuously growing volumes by a
variety of data sources and a variety of application fields rely on rapid
analysis of such data. Existing systems such as PostGIS or MobilityDB usually
build on relational database systems, thus, inheriting their scale-out
characteristics. As a consequence, big spatiotemporal data scenarios still have
limited support even though many query types can easily be parallelized. In
this paper, we propose our vision of a native serverless data processing
approach for spatiotemporal data: We break down queries into small subqueries
which then leverage the near-instant scaling of Function-as-a-Service platforms
to execute them in parallel. With this, we partially solve the scalability
needs of big spatiotemporal data processing.

TL;DR: SAGE: a data-semantics-aware system recommends diverse pivot tables with high utility, outperforming existing methods and scaling efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. Traditional works inadequately address the table-diversification problem

Method: a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and a scalable greedy algorithm

Result: SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted diverse pivot tables, ensures insightful, interpretable, and adaptive pivot tables, while guaranteeing diversity in the set of recommendations.

Conclusion: SAGE outperforms alternative approaches and efficiently scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets. SAGE's qualitative effectiveness is highlighted over commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).

Abstract: Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets. In
a spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data
by computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However,
identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables
remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the
problem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot
tables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of
recommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works
inadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to
consider the problem of pivot table diversification.
  We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted
diverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k
recommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is
insightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences,
while also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each
other, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical
contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a
single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a
scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot
tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce
the combinatorial search space. Our extensive experiments on three real-world
datasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently
scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we present
several case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over
commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).

*Jiale Lao,Immanuel Trummer*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SQLBarber, an LLM-based system, generates customized and realistic SQL workloads, overcoming limitations of existing methods and privacy concerns. It outperforms existing methods in customization, generation time, and cost distribution alignment, as demonstrated by ten open-source benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring real-world SQL queries is challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints.

Method: SQLBarber is a system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. It introduces a declarative interface, an LLM-powered pipeline with self-correction, and a Bayesian Optimizer.

Result: SQLBarber eliminates manual SQL template crafting, scales efficiently, and uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift and Snowflake to derive realistic query characteristics. Ten open-source benchmarks demonstrate its superiority in customization, generation time, and cost distribution alignment.

Conclusion: SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates. It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared with existing methods.

Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries
for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is
challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are
limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address
this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i)
eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while
providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to
constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of
queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and
execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift
and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost
distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber
introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate
customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a
self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based
on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different
predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost
distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据变得越来越重要，高效的数据探索至关重要，可以加速流程，改进预测并开发新的业务模型。由于数据的指数增长、异构性和分布，数据消费者通常花费 25-98% 的时间来搜索合适的数据。数据目录可以通过使用元数据回答用户查询来支持和加速数据探索。但是，由于元数据创建和维护通常是手动过程，因此非常耗时并且需要专业知识。

Result: LLM可以生成与人工创建内容相当的元数据，尤其是在需要高级语义理解的任务中。较大的模型优于较小的模型，并且微调显着提高了分类精度，而在大多数情况下，少量样本提示会产生更好的结果。

Conclusion: LLMs可以生成与人工创建内容相当的元数据，尤其是在需要高级语义理解的任务中。较大的模型优于较小的模型，并且微调显着提高了分类精度，而在大多数情况下，少量样本提示会产生更好的结果。虽然LLM提供了一种更快，更可靠的创建元数据的方式，但成功的应用需要仔细考虑特定于任务的标准和领域上下文。

Abstract: Efficient data exploration is crucial as data becomes increasingly important
for accelerating processes, improving forecasts and developing new business
models. Data consumers often spend 25-98 % of their time searching for suitable
data due to the exponential growth, heterogeneity and distribution of data.
Data catalogs can support and accelerate data exploration by using metadata to
answer user queries. However, as metadata creation and maintenance is often a
manual process, it is time-consuming and requires expertise. This study
investigates whether LLMs can automate metadata maintenance of text-based data
and generate high-quality DCAT-compatible metadata. We tested zero-shot and
few-shot prompting strategies with LLMs from different vendors for generating
metadata such as titles and keywords, along with a fine-tuned model for
classification. Our results show that LLMs can generate metadata comparable to
human-created content, particularly on tasks that require advanced semantic
understanding. Larger models outperformed smaller ones, and fine-tuning
significantly improves classification accuracy, while few-shot prompting yields
better results in most cases. Although LLMs offer a faster and reliable way to
create metadata, a successful application requires careful consideration of
task-specific criteria and domain context.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm to enhance the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-generated misinformation can be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation across multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate effectively.

Method: We propose a Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness, enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks. Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative meta-analysis

Result: proactive defense strategies offer up to 63% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention

Conclusion: Proactive defense strategies offer up to 63% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention, despite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges. Future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge foundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure LLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across critical
domains has amplified the societal risks posed by algorithmically generated
misinformation. Unlike traditional false content, LLM-generated misinformation
can be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation
across multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate
effectively. This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from
passive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a
Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of
training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding
self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness,
enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks.
Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative
meta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to
63\% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention,
despite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges. We
argue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge
foundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure
LLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.

### [141] [Enhancing Learning Path Recommendation via Multi-task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05295)
*Afsana Nasrin,Lijun Qian,Pamela Obiomon,Xishuang Dong*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-task LSTM model for personalized learning path recommendation, leveraging shared information and outperforming baselines on the ASSIST09 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized learning adapts to individual needs, and learning path recommendation is key to implementing it. Deep reinforcement learning has made such recommendations more practical, but there's room for improvement.

Method: A multi-task LSTM model is proposed to enhance learning path recommendation by leveraging shared information across tasks. It reframes the problem as a sequence-to-sequence prediction, using a shared LSTM layer for common features and task-specific layers for each objective. A non-repeat loss penalizes repeated items.

Result: The proposed model outperforms baseline methods on the ASSIST09 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-task LSTM model significantly outperforms baseline methods for learning path recommendation on the ASSIST09 dataset.

Abstract: Personalized learning is a student-centered educational approach that adapts
content, pace, and assessment to meet each learner's unique needs. As the key
technique to implement the personalized learning, learning path recommendation
sequentially recommends personalized learning items such as lectures and
exercises. Advances in deep learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning,
have made modeling such recommendations more practical and effective. This
paper proposes a multi-task LSTM model that enhances learning path
recommendation by leveraging shared information across tasks. The approach
reframes learning path recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
prediction problem, generating personalized learning paths from a learner's
historical interactions. The model uses a shared LSTM layer to capture common
features for both learning path recommendation and deep knowledge tracing,
along with task-specific LSTM layers for each objective. To avoid redundant
recommendations, a non-repeat loss penalizes repeated items within the
recommended learning path. Experiments on the ASSIST09 dataset show that the
proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods for the learning path
recommendation.

*Kai-Cheng Yang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: AI search systems' news citations are biased and don't affect user satisfaction, posing design and governance challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The citation patterns of AI search systems are poorly understood despite their growing influence.

Method: Analyzing data from the AI Search Arena, including 24,000 conversations and 65,000 responses from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google models, focusing on 366,000 citations.

Result: News citations concentrate among a few outlets, show a liberal bias, and user satisfaction isn't significantly affected by the political leaning or quality of cited news sources.

Conclusion: AI search systems face challenges in news citation, with implications for design and governance.

Abstract: AI-powered search systems are emerging as new information gatekeepers,
fundamentally transforming how users access news and information. Despite their
growing influence, the citation patterns of these systems remain poorly
understood. We address this gap by analyzing data from the AI Search Arena, a
head-to-head evaluation platform for AI search systems. The dataset comprises
over 24,000 conversations and 65,000 responses from models across three major
providers: OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google. Among the over 366,000 citations
embedded in these responses, 9% reference news sources. We find that while
models from different providers cite distinct news sources, they exhibit shared
patterns in citation behavior. News citations concentrate heavily among a small
number of outlets and display a pronounced liberal bias, though low-credibility
sources are rarely cited. User preference analysis reveals that neither the
political leaning nor the quality of cited news sources significantly
influences user satisfaction. These findings reveal significant challenges in
current AI search systems and have important implications for their design and
governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-tuning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where learnable prompt tokens are inserted to contextualize NLP queries

Method: an innovative graph prompt learning framework for ACS, PLACE integrates structural and learnable prompt tokens into the graph as a query-dependent refinement mechanism, forming a prompt-augmented graph. Within this prompt-augmented graph structure, the learned prompt tokens serve as a bridge that strengthens connections between graph nodes for the query, enabling the GNN to more effectively identify patterns of structural cohesiveness and attribute similarity related to the specific query. We employ an alternating training paradigm to optimize both the prompt parameters and the GNN jointly. Moreover, we design a divide-and-conquer strategy to enhance scalability, supporting the model to handle million-scale graphs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces IDFREE, an ID-free multimodal collaborative filtering recommendation baseline, which outperforms existing ID-based methods by 72.24% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ID features are effective but have limited benefits in multimodal collaborative filtering recommendation. they provide initial embedding but lack semantic richness, they provide a unique identifier for each user and item but hinder generalization to untrained data, and they assist in aligning and fusing multimodal features but may lead to representation shift

Method: proposes IDFREE, an ID-free multimodal collaborative Filtering REcommEndation baseline. IDFREE replaces ID features with multimodal features and positional encodings to generate semantically meaningful ID-free embeddings. proposes an adaptive similarity graph module to construct dynamic user-user and item-item graphs based on multimodal features. Then, an augmented user-item graph encoder is proposed to construct more effective user and item encoding. Finally, IDFREE achieves inter-multimodal alignment based on the contrastive learning and uses Softmax loss as recommendation loss.

Result: IDFREE outperforms existing ID-based MCFRec methods, achieving an average performance gain of 72.24% across standard metrics (Recall@5, 10, 20, 50 and NDCG@5, 10, 20, 50).

Conclusion: IDFREE outperforms existing ID-based MCFRec methods, achieving an average performance gain of 72.24% across standard metrics.

Abstract: Most existing multimodal collaborative filtering recommendation (MCFRec)
methods rely heavily on ID features and multimodal content to enhance
recommendation performance. However, this paper reveals that ID features are
effective but have limited benefits in multimodal collaborative filtering
recommendation. Therefore, this paper systematically deconstruct the pros and
cons of ID features: (i) they provide initial embedding but lack semantic
richness, (ii) they provide a unique identifier for each user and item but
hinder generalization to untrained data, and (iii) they assist in aligning and
fusing multimodal features but may lead to representation shift. Based on these
insights, this paper proposes IDFREE, an ID-free multimodal collaborative
Filtering REcommEndation baseline. IDFREE replaces ID features with multimodal
features and positional encodings to generate semantically meaningful ID-free
embeddings. For ID-free multimodal collaborative filtering, it further proposes
an adaptive similarity graph module to construct dynamic user-user and
item-item graphs based on multimodal features. Then, an augmented user-item
graph encoder is proposed to construct more effective user and item encoding.
Finally, IDFREE achieves inter-multimodal alignment based on the contrastive
learning and uses Softmax loss as recommendation loss. Basic experiments on
three public datasets demonstrate that IDFREE outperforms existing ID-based
MCFRec methods, achieving an average performance gain of 72.24% across standard
metrics (Recall@5, 10, 20, 50 and NDCG@5, 10, 20, 50). Exploratory and extended
experiments further validate our findings on the limitations of ID features in
MCFRec. The code is released at https://github.com/G-H-Li/IDFREE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)的兴起促使了对基于llm的推荐的研究，这种方法利用了llm强大的泛化和语言理解能力。然而，当仅仅依靠文本提示时，llm通常缺乏高质量推荐所必需的领域特定知识和协作信号。

Method: 该研究提出了一种新颖的框架SASRecLLM，该框架集成了SASRec（作为协同编码器）和使用Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) 进行微调的LLM。组件通过映射层连接以对齐其维度空间，并设计了三种有针对性的训练策略来优化混合架构。

Result: 在多个数据集上进行的大量实验表明，在冷启动和热启动场景中，SASRecLLM相对于强大的基线实现了稳健和一致的改进。

Conclusion: SASRecLLM通过融合结构化协同过滤与微调LLM的语义能力，为基于LLM的推荐领域提出了一个模块化和有效的范例，从而推进了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation (SASRec) effectively captures
long-term user preferences by applying attention mechanisms to historical
interactions. Concurrently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
motivated research into LLM-based recommendation, which leverages their
powerful generalization and language understanding capabilities. However, LLMs
often lack the domain-specific knowledge and collaborative signals essential
for high-quality recommendations when relying solely on textual prompts. To
address this limitation, this study proposes SASRecLLM, a novel framework that
integrates SASRec as a collaborative encoder with an LLM fine-tuned using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The components are connected via a mapping layer to
align their dimensional spaces, and three targeted training strategies are
designed to optimize the hybrid architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that SASRecLLM achieves robust and consistent improvements
over strong baselines in both cold-start and warm-start scenarios. This work
advances the field of LLM-based recommendation by presenting a modular and
effective paradigm for fusing structured collaborative filtering with the
semantic power of fine-tuned LLMs. The implementation is available on GitHub:

TL;DR: KERAG_R model enhances LLMs with knowledge graph information for improved recommendation performance, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs for recommendation tasks are limited by the absence of domain-specific knowledge, leading to inaccuracies. Directly using information from the knowledge graph introduces redundant and noisy information.

Method: A novel Knowledge-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Recommendation (KERAG_R) model is proposed, leveraging a graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) component to integrate information from a knowledge graph (KG) into instructions. A graph attention network (GAT) is pre-trained to select the most relevant triple for the target users.

Result: The proposed KERAG_R model significantly outperforms ten existing state-of-the-art recommendation methods.

Conclusion: The proposed KERAG_R model significantly outperforms ten existing state-of-the-art recommendation methods on three public datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommender
systems due to their contextual learning and generalisation capabilities.
Existing LLM-based recommendation approaches typically formulate the
recommendation task using specialised prompts designed to leverage their
contextual abilities, and aligning their outputs closely with human preferences
to yield an improved recommendation performance. However, the use of LLMs for
recommendation tasks is limited by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
This lack of relevant relational knowledge about the items to be recommended in
the LLM's pre-training corpus can lead to inaccuracies or hallucinations,
resulting in incorrect or misleading recommendations. Moreover, directly using
information from the knowledge graph introduces redundant and noisy
information, which can affect the LLM's reasoning process or exceed its input
context length, thereby reducing the performance of LLM-based recommendations.
To address the lack of domain-specific knowledge, we propose a novel model
called Knowledge-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Recommendation
(KERAG_R). Specifically, we leverage a graph retrieval-augmented generation
(GraphRAG) component to integrate additional information from a knowledge graph
(KG) into instructions, enabling the LLM to collaboratively exploit
recommendation signals from both text-based user interactions and the knowledge
graph to better estimate the users' preferences in a recommendation context. In
particular, we perform graph RAG by pre-training a graph attention network
(GAT) to select the most relevant triple for the target users for the used LLM,
thereby enhancing the LLM while reducing redundant and noisy information. Our
extensive experiments on three public datasets show that our proposed KERAG_R
model significantly outperforms ten existing state-of-the-art recommendation
methods.

Conclusion: The dynamic learned index surpasses the static implementation in terms of overall costs as the database grows.

Abstract: One of the main challenges within the growing research area of learned
indexing is the lack of adaptability to dynamically expanding datasets. This
paper explores the dynamization of a static learned index for complex data
through operations such as node splitting and broadening, enabling efficient
adaptation to new data. Furthermore, we evaluate the trade-offs between static
and dynamic approaches by introducing an amortized cost model to assess query
performance in tandem with the build costs of the index structure, enabling
experimental determination of when a dynamic learned index outperforms its
static counterpart. We apply the dynamization method to a static learned index
and demonstrate that its superior scaling quickly surpasses the static
implementation in terms of overall costs as the database grows. This is an
extended version of the paper presented at DAWAK 2025.

Method: Reproduce the RecRanker pipeline through the implementation of all its key components and propose RecRankerEval, an extensible framework that covers five key dimensions: user sampling strategy, initial recommendation model, LLM backbone, dataset selection, and instruction tuning method.

Result: The original results of RecRanker can be reproduced on the ML-100K and ML-1M datasets, as well as the additional Amazon-Music dataset, but not on BookCrossing due to the lack of timestamp information in the original RecRanker paper. The pairwise and listwise methods achieve a performance comparable to that reported in the original paper. For the pointwise method, the performance is abnormally high due to data leakage from the inclusion of ground-truth information in the prompts.

Conclusion: RecRanker's performance can be improved by employing alternative user sampling methods, stronger initial recommenders, and more capable LLMs.

Abstract: A recent Large language model (LLM)-based recommendation model, called
RecRanker, has demonstrated a superior performance in the top-k recommendation
task compared to other models. In particular, RecRanker samples users via
clustering, generates an initial ranking list using an initial recommendation
model, and fine-tunes an LLM through hybrid instruction tuning to infer user
preferences. However, the contribution of each core component remains
underexplored. In this work, we inspect the reproducibility of RecRanker, and
study the impact and role of its various components. We begin by reproducing
the RecRanker pipeline through the implementation of all its key components.
Our reproduction shows that the pairwise and listwise methods achieve a
performance comparable to that reported in the original paper. For the
pointwise method, while we are also able to reproduce the original paper's
results, further analysis shows that the performance is abnormally high due to
data leakage from the inclusion of ground-truth information in the prompts. To
enable a fair and comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based top-k recommendations,
we propose RecRankerEval, an extensible framework that covers five key
dimensions: user sampling strategy, initial recommendation model, LLM backbone,
dataset selection, and instruction tuning method. Using the RecRankerEval
framework, we show that the original results of RecRanker can be reproduced on
the ML-100K and ML-1M datasets, as well as the additional Amazon-Music dataset,
but not on BookCrossing due to the lack of timestamp information in the
original RecRanker paper. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RecRanker's
performance can be improved by employing alternative user sampling methods,
stronger initial recommenders, and more capable LLMs.

Abstract: Vector retrieval systems exhibit significant performance variance across
queries due to heterogeneous embedding quality. We propose a lightweight
framework for predicting retrieval performance at the query level by combining
quantization robustness and neighborhood density metrics. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that high-quality embeddings occupy geometrically
stable regions in the embedding space and exhibit consistent neighborhood
structures. We evaluate our method on 4 standard retrieval datasets, showing
consistent improvements of 9.4$\pm$1.2\% in Recall@10 over competitive
baselines. The framework requires minimal computational overhead (less than 5\%
of retrieval time) and enables adaptive retrieval strategies. Our analysis
reveals systematic patterns in embedding quality across different query types,

### [152] [Hierarchical Interaction Summarization and Contrastive Prompting for Explainable Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06044)
*Yibin Liu,Ang Li,Shijian Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for generating explainable recommendations that uses LLMs to create textual profiles of users and items and contrastive learning to generate high-quality explanations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods primarily rely on encoding features of users and items to embeddings, which often leads to information loss. LLMs must adjust or extend their parameters to interpret embeddings, a process that inevitably incurs information loss.

Method: The paper proposes a novel approach combining profile generation via hierarchical interaction summarization (PGHIS) and contrastive prompting for explanation generation (CPEG). PGHIS leverages a pretrained LLM to hierarchically summarize user-item interactions, generating structured textual profiles. CPEG employs contrastive learning to guide another reasoning language models in producing high-quality ground truth recommendation explanations. Finally, the textual profiles and high-quality explanations are used to fine-tune a LLM for generating explanations.

Result: The approach achieves a 5% improvement on GPTScore and generates ground truth explanations with a significantly higher win rate compared to user-written reviews and those produced by other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements in explainability and text quality metrics. The generated ground truth explanations achieve a significantly higher win rate compared to user-written reviews and those produced by other methods.

Abstract: Explainable recommendations, which use the information of user and item with
interaction to generate a explanation for why the user would interact with the
item, are crucial for improving user trust and decision transparency to the
recommender system. Existing methods primarily rely on encoding features of
users and items to embeddings, which often leads to information loss due to
dimensionality reduction, sparse interactions, and so on. With the advancements
of large language models (LLMs) in language comprehension, some methods use
embeddings as LLM inputs for explanation generation. However, since embeddings
lack inherent semantics, LLMs must adjust or extend their parameters to
interpret them, a process that inevitably incurs information loss. To address
this issue, we propose a novel approach combining profile generation via
hierarchical interaction summarization (PGHIS), which leverages a pretrained
LLM to hierarchically summarize user-item interactions, generating structured
textual profiles as explicit representations of user and item characteristics.
Additionally, we propose contrastive prompting for explanation generation
(CPEG) which employs contrastive learning to guide another reasoning language
models in producing high-quality ground truth recommendation explanations.
Finally, we use the textual profiles of user and item as input and high-quality
explanation as output to fine-tune a LLM for generating explanations.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a great improvement on
metrics about explainability (e.g., 5% on GPTScore) and text quality.
Furthermore, our generated ground truth explanations achieve a significantly
higher win rate compared to user-written reviews and those produced by other
methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of CPEG in generating high-quality
ground truths.

TL;DR: BBDRec 是一种新的序列推荐方法，它使用布朗桥扩散过程，将用户历史作为扩散过程的终点，从而更有效地利用历史信息，提高推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用历史信息，因为它们需要对“项目↔噪声”转换进行建模，这分散了注意力。因此，作者希望以无条件的方式重新构建用于序列推荐的扩散过程，将用户历史（而不是噪声）视为前向扩散过程的终点（即反向过程的起点），而不是作为条件输入。

Method: 提出了一种名为布朗桥扩散推荐 (BBDRec) 的方法，它利用布朗桥过程，强制执行结构化的噪声添加和去噪机制，确保轨迹被约束到特定的终点——用户历史。

Result: 大量实验表明 BBDRec 在提高序列推荐性能方面的有效性。

Conclusion: BBDRec通过利用布朗桥过程，增强了序列推荐的性能，该过程强制执行结构化的噪声添加和去噪机制，确保轨迹被约束到特定的终点——用户历史，而不是噪声。

Abstract: Diffusion models, known for their generative ability to simulate data
creation through noise-adding and denoising processes, have emerged as a
promising approach for building generative recommenders. To incorporate user
history for personalization, existing methods typically adopt a conditional
diffusion framework, where the reverse denoising process of reconstructing
items from noise is modified to be conditioned on the user history. However,
this design may fail to fully utilize historical information, as it gets
distracted by the need to model the "item $\leftrightarrow$ noise" translation.
This motivates us to reformulate the diffusion process for sequential
recommendation in an unconditional manner, treating user history (instead of
noise) as the endpoint of the forward diffusion process (i.e., the starting
point of the reverse process), rather than as a conditional input. This
formulation allows for exclusive focus on modeling the "item $\leftrightarrow$
history" translation. To this end, we introduce Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Recommendation (BBDRec). By leveraging a Brownian bridge process, BBDRec
enforces a structured noise addition and denoising mechanism, ensuring that the
trajectories are constrained towards a specific endpoint -- user history,
rather than noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate BBDRec's effectiveness in
enhancing sequential recommendation performance. The source code is available

TL;DR: 本文通过类比安德森定位分析了 GNN 中的过平滑机制，并提出了通过减少信息传播中的无序性来缓解过平滑的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNN）在图数据分析中显示出巨大的潜力，但随着网络深度的增加，过平滑问题变得更加严重，导致节点表示失去独特性。

Method: 通过类比安德森定位，并引入参与度作为度量来量化过平滑现象。

Result: GNN 中过平滑可以理解为低频模式的扩展（参与度增加）和高频模式的定位（参与度降低）。

Conclusion: 理论分析表明，减少信息传播中的无序性有可能缓解过平滑问题。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data
analysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the
network depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,
causing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes
the mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization
and introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.
Specifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after
multiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,
similar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this
context, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of
low-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of
high-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we
systematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson
localization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in
Graph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed
the potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in
information propagation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的时间序列预测方法，该方法通过消除冗余并提高对外生输入的感知能力来改进预测，从而在四个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大多数基于 Transformer 的时间序列预测模型主要依赖于内生输入，但最近最先进的方法通过结合外生输入中的外部信息，显着提高了性能。然而，这些方法面临着挑战，例如当内生和外生输入来自同一来源时的冗余，以及由于固定回溯窗口而捕获长期依赖性的能力有限。

Conclusion: 该方法在四个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，始终优于 11 个基线模型。这些结果证明了我们的方法是时间序列预测中外生输入的稳健而有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Although most transformer-based time series forecasting models primarily
depend on endogenous inputs, recent state-of-the-art approaches have
significantly improved performance by incorporating external information
through exogenous inputs. However, these methods face challenges, such as
redundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source
and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back
windows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to
reduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics.
Additionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of
patterns and trends over extended periods. By introducing this refined,
globally context-aware exogenous input to the endogenous input without
increasing the lookback window length, our approach guides the model towards
improved forecasting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models. These
results establish our method as a robust and effective alternative for using
exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to
reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of
multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean,
macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic
micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural
network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing
average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or
Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local
stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the
definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical
constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state
and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary
conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated
considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying
geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves
significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it
particularly attractive for large-scale applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating soft tissue in virtual environments is important for medical applications, but high deformability poses challenges for existing segmentation, meshing, and stiffness estimation methods. Haptic feedback integration requires precise force estimation.

Method: A conditional graph neural network (cGNN) trained on experimental data and mass-spring simulations via transfer learning.

Result: The model predicts deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\\\pm$0.03 mm (up to 30 mm deformations) and force with an absolute error of 0.37$\\\pm$0.05 N (up to 7.5 N forces).

Conclusion: A data-driven cGNN model accurately predicts soft tissue deformation and interaction forces, offering a promising solution for virtual environment simulations and various fields requiring realistic soft tissue behavior.

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

*Chi-Chang Lee,Zhang-Wei Hong,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Heuristic Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO), a new framework that effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO maximizes policy improvement instead of policy invariance and achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, even with poorly designed heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards. Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of policy invariance, which guarantees that the performance of a policy obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform poorly.

Method: Heuristic Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO)

Result: HEPO achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans, showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design.

Conclusion: HEPO is a plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement learning. It achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks and allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even when heuristics are not well-engineered, showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design.

Conclusion: 该模型支持基础模型的关键功能，包括少样本泛化和有效适应，并强调了将因果结构编码到结构化数据的表示学习中的重要性。

Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a
fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical
phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments.
This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or
multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model
that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a
dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning.
Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same
target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured
under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for
the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated
astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars
observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),
our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation
models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These
results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation
models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and
highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation
learning for structured data.

TL;DR: This paper compares SFT and RFT in continual post-training, finding RFT superior due to its ability to retain knowledge and enhance general capabilities, attributed to its implicit regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fundamental role of the learning paradigm within continual post-training (CPT) remains largely unexplored. Existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization.

Method: Comparative analysis of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) on seven diverse multimodal tasks, using Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model. A rollout-based instance filtering algorithm is proposed to improve RFT's stability and efficiency.

Result: SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting, while RFT preserves prior knowledge and achieves performance comparable to multi-task training. RFT also protects and enhances the model's general knowledge, while SFT degrades it. Implicit regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.

Conclusion: RFT is a superior and robust paradigm for continual post-training compared to SFT.

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for
adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific
and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily
concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter
regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two
core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge
retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising
seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base
model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant
findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT
inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to
multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the
model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).
Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis
shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought
reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit
regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.
Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the
stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the
superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

$\textbf{A}$nalysis ($\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$), a novel framework that combines
over-approximation techniques from LiRPA-based approaches with a sampling-based
method to compute tight intermediate reachable sets. In detail, we show that
with negligible computational overhead, $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$ exploiting the
estimated reachable sets, significantly tightens the lower and upper linear
bounds of a neural network's output, reducing the computational cost of formal
verification tools while providing probabilistic guarantees on verification
soundness. Extensive experiments on standard formal verification benchmarks,
including the International Verification of Neural Networks Competition, show
that our $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$-based verifier improves robustness certificates by
up to 3.31X and 2.26X compared to related work. Importantly, our probabilistic
approach results in a valuable solution for challenging competition entries
where state-of-the-art formal verification methods fail, allowing us to provide
answers with high confidence (i.e., at least 99%).

Conclusion: AXLearn在保持与最先进训练系统相当的性能的同时，也保持了模块化

Abstract: We design and implement AXLearn, a production deep learning system that
facilitates scalable and high-performance training of large deep learning
models. Compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning systems, AXLearn has a
unique focus on modularity and support for heterogeneous hardware
infrastructure. AXLearn's internal interfaces between software components
follow strict encapsulation, allowing different components to be assembled to
facilitate rapid model development and experimentation on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure. We introduce a novel method of quantifying modularity via
Lines-of-Code (LoC)-complexity, which demonstrates how our system maintains
constant complexity as we scale the components in the system, compared to
linear or quadratic complexity in other systems. This allows integrating
features such as Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) into AXLearn across hundred
of modules with just 10 lines of code, compared to hundreds as required in
other systems. At the same time, AXLearn maintains equivalent performance
compared to state-of-the-art training systems. Finally, we share our experience

*Gautam Sreekumar,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RepLIn, an algorithm that enforces statistical independence during interventions to learn robust representations, improving performance on interventional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat interventional data like observational data and ignore the independence relations that arise from these interventions, which results in performance disparities.

Method: RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce statistical independence during interventions

Result: RepLIn demonstrates utility on synthetic, image, and text datasets, improving robustness against interventional distribution shifts.

Conclusion: RepLIn is scalable and improves robust representations against interventional distribution shifts.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning robust discriminative representations of
causally-related latent variables. In addition to observational data, the
training dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted
interventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust
against the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches
treat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying
causal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from
these interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal
relational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations
that produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and
interventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training
samples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation
between this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the
independence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For
linear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of
interventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional
independence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and
its non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these
insights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce
this statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility
of RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial
attribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments
show that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and
is suitable to improve the robust representations against interventional
distribution shifts of both continuous and discrete latent variables.

Motivation: distressed firms have the incentive and desire to manipulate their financial reports to hide their distress and derive personal gains

Method: Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks that adapt the attacker's search direction

Result: find 20x more satisfying attacks compared to standard attacks

Conclusion: a company could inflate their earnings by 100-200%, while simultaneously reducing their fraud scores by 15%

Abstract: Bad actors, primarily distressed firms, have the incentive and desire to
manipulate their financial reports to hide their distress and derive personal
gains. As attackers, these firms are motivated by potentially millions of
dollars and the availability of many publicly disclosed and used financial
modeling frameworks. Existing attack methods do not work on this data due to
anti-correlated objectives that must both be satisfied for the attacker to
succeed. We introduce Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks that
adapt the attacker's search direction to find $20\times$ more satisfying
attacks compared to standard attacks. The result is that in $\approx50\%$ of
cases, a company could inflate their earnings by 100-200%, while simultaneously
reducing their fraud scores by 15%. By working with lawyers and professional
accountants, we ensure our threat model is realistic to how such frauds are
performed in practice.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Horizon-DQN (H-DQN), a distributional multi-step RL framework, to address the challenge of delayed and sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, particularly in the game 2048. H-DQN significantly outperforms standard DQN, PPO, and QR-DQN, achieving higher scores and reaching the 2048 tile.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes this challenge

Method: Unified, distributional multi-step RL framework and Horizon-DQN (H-DQN)

Result: H-DQN reaches the 2048 tile, max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile

Conclusion: Distributional, multi-step targets substantially enhance performance in sparse-reward domains.

Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions
whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes
this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback,
they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal
strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL
framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the
open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants:
standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN
(H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy
networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear
hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to
5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048
tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These
results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially
enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising
avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

Result: 实验证明，与其它探索方法相比，该探索策略能显著提高FB算法的样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出了基于FB表示的探索策略，并证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies
in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings.
Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for
learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the
policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot
reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration
problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection.
We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration
in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design
exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that
minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its
epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled
exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm
considerably in comparison to other exploration methods. Code is publicly
available at https://sites.google.com/view/fbee-url.

Method: 将动态后悔最小化问题转化为函数空间中的静态后悔问题，并构建再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）。

Result: 在线性损失下恢复了最优动态后悔保证，并获得了新的无尺度和方向自适应动态后悔保证。该方法适用于任何损失序列，并在指数凹和非正常线性回归设置中恢复了有界结果。算法在实践中可计算。

Conclusion: 通过在函数空间中构建合适的再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS），该方法能够恢复线性损失下的最优动态后悔保证，并产生新的无尺度和方向自适应动态后悔保证。此外，该方法适用于任何损失序列，允许在指数凹和非正常线性回归设置中恢复有界结果。

Abstract: We study dynamic regret in online convex optimization, where the objective is
to achieve low cumulative loss relative to an arbitrary benchmark sequence. By
observing that competing with an arbitrary sequence of comparators
$u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}$ in $\mathcal{W}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is equivalent to
competing with a fixed comparator function $u:[1,T]\to \mathcal{W}$, we frame
dynamic regret minimization as a static regret problem in a function space. By
carefully constructing a suitable function space in the form of a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), our reduction enables us to recover the optimal
$R_{T}(u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}) = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T})$
dynamic regret guarantee in the setting of linear losses, and yields new
scale-free and directionally-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees. Moreover,
unlike prior dynamic-to-static reductions -- which are valid only for linear
losses -- our reduction holds for any sequence of losses, allowing us to
recover $\mathcal{O}\big(\|u\|^2+d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)\ln T\big)$ bounds in
exp-concave and improper linear regression settings, where
$d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$ is a measure of complexity of the RKHS. Despite
working in an infinite-dimensional space, the resulting reduction leads to
algorithms that are computable in practice, due to the reproducing property of
RKHSs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无训练扩散指导框架，该框架基于替代随机最优控制目标，并结合了一种新的运行成本函数，以在低密度区域实现有效的指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机最优控制 (SOC) 最近作为微调扩散模型的原则性框架出现。然而，它对计算密集型模拟的依赖使其不适用于快速采样。与此同时，一类无训练方法已经被开发出来，该方法使用现成的分类器在预测的干净样本上指导扩散模型，绕过了在噪声数据上训练分类器的需要。这些方法可以被解释为近似 SOC 方案，使用 Tweedie 公式来估计扩散后验。然而，在实践中，这种直接近似可能会引入重大误差，导致不可靠的指导。

Method: 我们提出了一个基于替代随机最优控制目标的新的无训练扩散指导框架。我们推导了价值函数的一个新的理论界限，揭示了校正近似后验以保持对真实扩散后验的忠实性的必要性。为此，我们将问题与 Stein 变分推理联系起来，Stein 变分推理旨在最小化两个后验之间的 Kullback-Leibler 差异的最速下降方向。我们的方法引入了一种基于原则的校正机制，并结合了一种新的运行成本函数，以在低密度区域实现有效的指导。

Result: 在具有挑战性的分子生成任务上的实验表明，SDG 显著优于标准的无训练指导方法。

Conclusion: Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG) 在具有挑战性的分子生成任务上显著优于标准无训练指导方法，突显了其在更广泛应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control (SOC) has recently emerged as a principled
framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. However, its dependence on
computationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.
In parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides
diffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,
bypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be
interpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate
diffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can
introduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we
unify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free
diffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control
objective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals
the necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to
the true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein
variational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our
method, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a
principled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost
functional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on
challenging molecular generation tasks demonstrate that SDG significantly
outperforms standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential
for broader applications.

Abstract: Data-driven science and computation have advanced immensely to construct
complex functional relationships using trainable parameters. However,
efficiently discovering interpretable and accurate closed-form expressions from
complex dataset remains a challenge. The article presents a novel approach
called Explainable Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks or Ex-HiDeNN that
uses an accurate, frugal, fast, separable, and scalable neural architecture
with symbolic regression to discover closed-form expressions from limited
observation. The article presents the two-step Ex-HiDeNN algorithm with a
separability checker embedded in it. The accuracy and efficiency of Ex-HiDeNN
are tested on several benchmark problems, including discerning a dynamical
system from data, and the outcomes are reported. Ex-HiDeNN generally shows
outstanding approximation capability in these benchmarks, producing orders of
magnitude smaller errors compared to reference data and traditional symbolic
regression. Later, Ex-HiDeNN is applied to three engineering applications: a)
discovering a closed-form fatigue equation, b) identification of hardness from
micro-indentation test data, and c) discovering the expression for the yield
surface with data. In every case, Ex-HiDeNN outperformed the reference methods
used in the literature. The proposed method is built upon the foundation and
published works of the authors on Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network
(HiDeNN) and Convolutional HiDeNN. The article also provides a clear idea about
the current limitations and future extensions of Ex-HiDeNN.

Abstract: We present an integrated graph-based neural networks architecture for

as a data-driven graph structure represented by a set of nodes (representing
buildings), connected through a route of edges or links using a novel Graph
Convolution plus LSTM Neural Network (GCLSTM) which has shown remarkable
success in modelling complex patterns. We describe the formulation, model
estimation, interpretability and examine the relative performance of our
proposed model. We also present an illustrative architecture of the models and
apply on real-world WiFi logs collected at the Toronto Metropolitan University
campus. The results of the experiments show that the integrated GCLSTM models

Abstract: Distributed learning methods have gained substantial momentum in recent

Gradient compression techniques alleviate communication costs but involve an
inherent trade-off between the empirical efficiency of biased compressors and

a novel Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that leverages biased
compressors to construct statistically unbiased estimates. This approach
effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased methods, combining the
strengths of both. To showcase the versatility of our method, we apply it to

Motivation: The estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) is increasingly adopted across scientific and industrial applications, leading to the expansion of the treatment action space to structured treatment policies with multiple policy factors.

Method: The authors develop a methodology to directly rank subjects using aggregated HTE functions, constructing a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework to incorporate multiple factors satisfying the Naive Bayes assumption.

Result: The algorithms developed improve performance on public datasets.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a generic framework for deep learning of heterogeneous treatment policies, demonstrating improved performance on public datasets.

Abstract: As estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) is increasingly adopted
across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, the treatment
action space can naturally expand, from a binary treatment variable to a
structured treatment policy. This policy may include several policy factors
such as a continuous treatment intensity variable, or discrete treatment
assignments. From first principles, we derive the formulation for incorporating
multiple treatment policy variables into the functional forms of individual and
average treatment effects. Building on this, we develop a methodology to
directly rank subjects using aggregated HTE functions. In particular, we
construct a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework
to incorporate an arbitrary number of factors that satisfies the Naive Bayes
assumption. The factored layer is then applied with continuous treatment
variables, treatment assignment, and direct ranking of aggregated treatment
effect functions. Together, these algorithms build towards a generic framework
for deep learning of heterogeneous treatment policies, and we show their power
to improve performance with public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observational data are often compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single structure prone to overconfidence. The number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable.

Method: Using meta-learning to create an end-to-end model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process (MACE-TNP).

Result: MACE-TNP outperforms strong Bayesian baselines.

Conclusion: MACE-TNP outperforms strong Bayesian baselines and establishes meta-learning as a flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal inference.

Abstract: In scientific domains -- from biology to the social sciences -- many
questions boil down to \textit{What effect will we observe if we intervene on a
particular variable?} If the causal relationships (e.g.~a causal graph) are
known, it is possible to estimate the intervention distributions. In the
absence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from
the available observational data. However, observational data are often
compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single
structure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural
uncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior
distribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.
Unfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with
the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose
to circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end
model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process
(MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged
interventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the
need for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP
outperforms strong Bayesian baselines. Our work establishes meta-learning as a
flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal

### [180] [Mitigating Shortcut Learning with InterpoLated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05527)
*Michalis Korakakis,Andreas Vlachos,Adrian Weller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InterpoLL通过插值学习，削弱shortcut影响，提高模型在少数类上的泛化能力，且不影响多数类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经验风险最小化(ERM)激励模型利用捷径，即输入属性和标签之间的虚假相关性，这些相关性在大多数训练数据中普遍存在，但与手头的任务无关。这种依赖性阻碍了少数例子的泛化，在这些例子中，这种相关性不成立。

Method: 提出了InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL)，通过插值多数类样本的表示来包含来自具有shortcut-mitigating模式的类内少数类样本的特征。

Result: 在多个自然语言理解任务上的实验结果表明，InterpoLL改进了少数类泛化，优于ERM和最先进的shortcut缓解方法。

Conclusion: InterpoLL提高了少数类泛化能力，且不影响多数类的准确性。该方法具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts,
i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are
prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at
hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such
correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are
model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to
improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose
InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of
majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with
shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models
to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples.
Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks
demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and
state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on
majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder,
encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's
broad applicability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对GNN模型的硬件故障攻击GBFA，该攻击通过在存储器中注入故障来修改权重，从而降低预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于硬件的攻击的安全挑战通常被忽略。本文研究了GNN模型对基于硬件的故障攻击的脆弱性。

Method: 提出了一种层感知的位翻转故障攻击GBFA，通过在存储设备中注入故障来修改训练后的权重参数，从而尝试错误分类输出。

Result: GBFA攻击使GraphSAGE在Cora数据集上的预测准确率降低了17%，仅在最后一层进行了一次位翻转。

Conclusion: GBFA攻击显著降低了预测准确率，并且其在不同层的影响变化突出了在GNN中采用层感知攻击策略的重要性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful machine learning
method for graph-structured data. A plethora of hardware accelerators has been
introduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.
However, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally
overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to
hardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output
by modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory
device. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware
bit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight
gradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of
bits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is
created to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted
from memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a
specific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the
selected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node
classification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that
GBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its
impact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a
layer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's
prediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in
the last layer.

Abstract: Jumping connections enable Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to overcome
over-smoothing, while graph sparsification reduces computational demands by
selecting a sub-matrix of the graph adjacency matrix during neighborhood
aggregation. Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical
success across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the
generalization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring
either graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the
first learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping
connections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the
generalization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest
achievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the
proposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification
maintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges
that support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections
lead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a
two-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified
matrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the
best of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of
jumping connections' role in sparsification requirements. We validate our
theoretical results on benchmark datasets in deep GCNs.

Conclusion: LSC-GNN在具有噪声关系结构的设置中，有潜力提高预测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with noisy edges. We propose
Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate
external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train
two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on
a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then
penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint
steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs
subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and
validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein
interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight
LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in
settings with noisy relational structures.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to ergonomic risk
assessment in manual material handling, particularly for estimating carried
load from gait motion data collected from wearable sensors. However, existing
approaches often rely on direct mappings from loaded gait to hand load,
limiting generalization and predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an
enhanced load estimation framework that incorporates auxiliary information,
including baseline gait patterns during unloaded walking and carrying style.
While baseline gait can be automatically captured by wearable sensors and is
thus readily available at inference time, carrying style typically requires
manual labeling and is often unavailable during deployment. Our model
integrates deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks
and bi-directional cross-attention to capture gait dynamics and fuse loaded and
unloaded gait patterns. Guided by domain knowledge, the model is designed to
estimate load magnitude conditioned on carrying style, while eliminating the
need for carrying style labels at inference time. Experiments using real-world
data collected from inertial measurement units attached to participants
demonstrate substantial accuracy gains from incorporating auxiliary information
and highlight the importance of explicit fusion mechanisms over naive feature
concatenation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Humans use experience to learn solutions to unpursued tasks. Multitask Preplay algorithm mimics this to improve AI performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were accessible but not pursued.

Method: Multitask Preplay, a novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.

Result: Multitask preplay better predicts how humans generalize to tasks and enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel worlds.

Conclusion: Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging multitask environments.

Abstract: Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only
pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage
experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were
accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a
novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for
"preplay" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.
Preplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast,
adaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional
planning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better
predicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in
a small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize
to these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a
partially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask
Preplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel
Craftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate
that Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually
learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the
same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging
multitask environments.

Conclusion: 使用近端策略优化（PPO）的无模型强化学习方法，实现了衍射光学处理器的原位训练，并在各种原位学习任务中验证了该方法的有效性，展示了更好的收敛性和性能。

Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information
processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform
for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the
effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is
hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their
inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in
situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the
physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by
slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited
measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning
approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training
of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement
data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster
convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ
learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser,
holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image
classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance.
Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts
for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system
knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under
realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning
approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical
systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.

Abstract: In this work we propose a unified Fourier Spectral Transformer network that
integrates the strengths of classical spectral methods and attention based
neural architectures. By transforming the original PDEs into spectral ordinary
differential equations, we use high precision numerical solvers to generate
training data and use a Transformer network to model the evolution of the
spectral coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the
two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the one dimensional
Burgers' equation. The results show that our spectral Transformer can achieve
highly accurate long term predictions even with limited training data, better
than traditional numerical methods and machine learning methods in forecasting
future flow dynamics. The proposed framework generalizes well to unseen data,
bringing a promising paradigm for real time prediction and control of complex
dynamical systems.

Abstract: Reward hacking in Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems poses a critical threat
to the deployment of autonomous agents, where agents exploit flaws in reward
functions to achieve high scores without fulfilling intended objectives.
Despite growing awareness of this problem, systematic detection and mitigation
approaches remain limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of
reward hacking across diverse RL environments and algorithms. We analyze 15,247
training episodes across 15 RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, custom domains) and
5 algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, A3C, Rainbow), implementing automated detection
algorithms for six categories of reward hacking: specification gaming, reward
tampering, proxy optimization, objective misalignment, exploitation patterns,
and wireheading. Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7%
recall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through
controlled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that
reward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking
frequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through
three simulated application studies representing recommendation systems,
competitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques
reduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find
these trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false
positive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets,
and experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible
research in RL safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how neural networks learn and represent features is a central challenge in deep learning theory.

Method: The paper proves the Features at Convergence Theorem (FACT), which relates the feature matrix to input vectors and loss gradients. It then modifies Recursive Feature Machines (RFM) to obey the FACT, creating FACT-RFM.

Result: The paper validates the FACT empirically and shows that neural features satisfy it at convergence. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on tabular data and captures feature learning behaviors observed in neural network training.

Conclusion: The paper introduces FACT-RFM, a new learning algorithm based on the Features at Convergence Theorem (FACT), and demonstrates its high performance on tabular data and ability to capture feature learning behaviors like grokking and phase transitions.

Abstract: A central challenge in deep learning theory is to understand how neural
networks learn and represent features. To this end, we prove the Features at
Convergence Theorem (FACT), which gives a self-consistency equation that neural
network weights satisfy at convergence when trained with nonzero weight decay.
For each weight matrix $W$, this equation relates the "feature matrix" $W^\top
W$ to the set of input vectors passed into the matrix during forward
propagation and the loss gradients passed through it during backpropagation. We
validate this relation empirically, showing that neural features indeed satisfy
the FACT at convergence. Furthermore, by modifying the "Recursive Feature
Machines" of Radhakrishnan et al. 2024 so that they obey the FACT, we arrive at
a new learning algorithm, FACT-RFM. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on
tabular data and captures various feature learning behaviors that occur in
neural network training, including grokking in modular arithmetic and phase
transitions in learning sparse parities.

whether neurological and orthopedic gait could facilitate gait analysis. Our
investigation focused on optimizing both performance and generalizability in
distinguishing between these gait abnormalities. Variations in sensor

Motivation: Efficient federated training of MoE-structured LAMs is hindered by system-level challenges, particularly in managing heterogeneous client resources and the coordination required for specialized experts. There is a lack of robust quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment.

Conclusion: This paper proposes a conceptual system design for intelligent client-expert alignment in federated MoE-structured LAMs, which can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training mechanisms.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale
artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving
privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured
LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in
managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the
sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This
article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust
quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically
considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load
balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent
client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global
expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these
systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing computational units across hardware in deep learning kernel development requires extensive empirical tuning, and manual tuning of parameters in domain-specific languages like Triton creates barriers to optimal performance.

Method: Introduces AutoTriton, an 8B model dedicated to Triton programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL), using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: AutoTriton achieves performance comparable to mainstream large models on TritonBench and KernelBench. The SFT stage, the RL stage, and the reward design strategy all play crucial roles.

Conclusion: AutoTriton achieves performance comparable to mainstream large models and establishes a foundation for building more efficient AI systems.

Abstract: Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units
across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and
hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although
domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting
low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such
as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,
creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In
this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton
programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming
expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based
reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming
ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of
TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves
performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet
and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial
role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,
and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for
automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance
kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an
important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code
will be available at https://github.com/AI9Stars/AutoTriton.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to
automate everyday mobile and web tasks. These agents interpret raw GUI
screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which
bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing
methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected
trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific
UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to dynamic network conditions.

Method: a hierarchical offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.

Result: The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring the task completion rate.

Conclusion: The proposed approach outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic vehicular environments.

Abstract: With the emergence of compute-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising
complement for vehicular edge computing due to the high mobility and flexible
deployment. However, the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are
insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to
dynamic network conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a dual-layer
UAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed
of the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of
low-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and
coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is
formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring
the task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical
offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method
decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate
offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the
local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.
Simulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and
convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic
vehicular environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: AI-based methods have revolutionized atmospheric forecasting, with recent
successes in medium-range forecasting spurring the development of climate
foundation models. Accurate modeling of complex atmospheric dynamics at high
spatial resolutions and longer lead times requires large neural networks and
gigabyte-sized data samples, making accelerator memory and I/O-bandwidth the
bottlenecks for model training. We introduce WeatherMixer, a
multi-layer-perceptron-based architecture whose workload scales linearly with
input size, allowing the model to learn global weather phenomena at accuracies
similar to numerical weather prediction. To cope with the computational demand,
we propose Jigsaw, a novel model parallelization scheme that employs both
domain and tensor parallelism, eliminating memory redundancy. Jigsaw exceeds
state-of-the-art performance in strong scaling in compute-communication-limited
systems and achieves superscalar weak scaling in I/O-bandwidth-limited systems.
We scale training to 256 GPUs, reaching peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs,
23% and 28% of theoretical peaks, achieving 68% and 72% scaling efficiency
versus 51% without model parallelism.

Abstract: Cardiac diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
worldwide, which requires accurate and timely diagnostic strategies. In this
study, we introduce an innovative approach that combines deep learning image
registration with physics-informed regularization to predict the biomechanical
properties of moving cardiac tissues and extract features for disease
classification. We utilize the energy strain formulation of Neo-Hookean
material to model cardiac tissue deformations, optimizing the deformation field
while ensuring its physical and biomechanical coherence. This explainable
approach not only improves image registration accuracy, but also provides
insights into the underlying biomechanical processes of the cardiac tissues.
Evaluation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset achieved
Dice scores of 0.945 for the left ventricular cavity, 0.908 for the right
ventricular cavity, and 0.905 for the myocardium. Subsequently, we estimate the
local strains within the moving heart and extract a detailed set of features
used for cardiovascular disease classification. We evaluated five
classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support
Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbour, and identified the
most relevant features using a feature selection algorithm. The best performing
classifier obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in the training set and
100% in the test set of the ACDC dataset. By integrating explainable artificial
intelligence, this method empowers clinicians with a transparent understanding
of the model's predictions based on cardiac mechanics, while also significantly
improving the accuracy and reliability of cardiac disease diagnosis, paving the
way for more personalized and effective patient care.
