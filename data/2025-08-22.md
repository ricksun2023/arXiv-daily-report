### [1] [Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904)
*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new co-training framework for LLMs improves content safety with better control, efficiency, and performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current content safety methods in LLMs rely on multi-stage training and lack fine-grained, post-deployment controllability.

Method: A unified co-training framework is proposed to integrate positive, negative, and rejective safety behaviors within a single SFT stage, activated by magic tokens for behavioral switching at inference time.

Result: The co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin, with well-separated response distributions for each safety mode. Experiments show the method matches the safety alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with the 8B model surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in safety performance.

Conclusion: The proposed co-training method provides a scalable, efficient, and highly controllable solution for LLM content safety, matching or surpassing existing methods in safety alignment quality while reducing training complexity and deployment costs.

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The purpose of this report is to share preliminary results with task participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission papers.

Method: MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.

Result: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation Shared Task.

Conclusion: The official WMT25 ranking will be based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the automatic ranking.

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission

### [3] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种LLM驱动的文化本地化框架，用于自动构建具有本地名称、组织和货币的数学单词问题数据集，从而缓解以英语为中心的实体偏差并提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏反映准确的本地实体（如人名、组织名称和货币）的社会文化任务数据集，低资源语言中多语言和文化基础的数学推理落后于英语。

Method: LLM驱动的数学单词问题文化本地化框架，可自动构建具有来自现有来源的本机名称、组织和货币的数据集。

Result: 翻译后的基准可能会掩盖适当的社会文化背景下的真实多语言数学能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于缓解以英语为中心的实体偏差，并在跨各种语言引入本机实体时提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct model for machine translation using DPO training


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced data resources

Method: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset

Result: achieved a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating Wikipedia articles

Conclusion: The fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset generation and more consistently avoids language and formatting errors.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

*Qianli Wang,Tatiana Anikina,Nils Feldhus,Simon Ostermann,Fedor Splitt,Jiaao Li,Yoana Tsoneva,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiCoXQL and Compass, two new multilingual datasets for ConvXAI systems, and proposes a new parsing approach to enhance multilingual parsing performance. The paper evaluates several LLMs and BERT-type models on these datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method. While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users' underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited.

Method: We propose a new parsing approach aimed at enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies.

Result: To bridge these gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one low-resource language. Furthermore, we present Compass, a new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.

Conclusion: We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass, employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,

### [6] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的奖励转移推测抽样（SSS）算法，该算法在测试时以更低的推理成本实现了卓越的黄金奖励分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时对齐技术通常会产生大量的推理成本，限制了它们的实际应用。我们受到推测抽样加速的启发，它利用小型草稿模型来有效地预测未来的token，以解决测试时对齐的效率瓶颈。

Method: 引入了奖励转移推测采样 (SSS) 算法，其中草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，而目标模型保持不变。

Result: 通过修改接受标准和奖励token分布，可以利用对齐的草稿模型和未对齐的目标模型之间的分布偏移来恢复 RLHF 最优解，而无需实际获得它。

Conclusion: 该算法在测试时弱到强对齐实验中以显着降低的推理成本实现了卓越的黄金奖励分数，从而验证了其有效性和效率。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall is a new framework for evaluating the completeness of machine-generated text, which improves accuracy by decomposing answers and verifying their alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring completeness in machine-generated text is crucial, but existing recall metrics have limitations.

Method: A three-stage recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts, narrows candidate matches through lexical and semantic filtering, and verifies alignment through structured entailment checks.

Result: LongRecall demonstrates substantial improvements in recall accuracy on three challenging long-form QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: LongRecall improves recall accuracy on long-form QA benchmarks compared to lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

TL;DR: combine LLMs with combinatorial inference to address hallucinations and complex reasoning problems, addition of symbolic inference leads to more consistent and accurate predictions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive nature.

Method: combining LLMs with combinatorial inference

Result: addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads to increased performance for challenging tasks

Conclusion: structured learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Nemotron-CC-Math, a large, high-quality math corpus extracted from Common Crawl using a new pipeline. Pretraining on this corpus improves performance on math, code, and general reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure.

Method: A novel, domain-agnostic pipeline is used for robust scientific text extraction from Common Crawl, recovering math across various formats and standardizing notation into LaTeX representation.

Result: The Nemotron-CC-Math corpus surpasses all prior open math datasets in size and quality. Pretraining on this corpus yields +4.8 to +12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a new pipeline for extracting high-quality mathematical data from Common Crawl, resulting in the Nemotron-CC-Math corpus. Pretraining a Nemotron-T 8B model on this corpus yields significant performance gains on math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains. The approach leverages external evidence to mitigate hallucinations. Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that incorporating retrieved evidence is beneficial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: answering questions with false assumptions require identifying the false assumptions. LLMs often generate misleading answers because of hallucinations

Method: an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations

Result: Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that incorporating retrieved evidence is beneficial and generating and validating atomic assumptions yields more improvements

Conclusion: incorporating retrieved evidence is beneficial and generating/validating atomic assumptions yields more improvements

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

*Seungmin Han,Haeun Kwon,Ji-jun Park,Taeyang Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了MMDR-Bench基准测试和CoLVLM Agent框架，用于解决复杂多模态对话推理中的挑战。CoLVLM Agent在性能上优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM和LVLM在处理需要深度推理、持续上下文理解、实体跟踪和多步骤指令遵循的复杂、多轮和视觉接地的任务时仍面临重大挑战。现有基准测试通常无法捕捉到真实世界多模态交互的动态性和复杂性，导致上下文丢失和视觉幻觉等问题。

Method: 提出CoLVLM Agent，通过迭代的“记忆-感知-计划-执行”循环增强现有LVLM的推理和指令遵循能力，无需对底层模型进行大量重新训练。

Result: CoLVLM Agent在MMDR-Bench上始终表现出卓越的性能，平均人类评估得分为4.03，超过了GPT-4o（3.92）和Gemini 1.5 Pro（3.85）。该框架在推理深度、指令遵循和错误抑制方面表现出显著优势，并在扩展的对话轮次中保持了稳健的性能。

Conclusion: CoLVLM Agent在复杂多模态交互中表现出色，优于GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro，验证了其模块化设计和迭代方法的有效性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [12] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SemToken，一种语义感知的tokenization框架，可减少token冗余并提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法（例如 Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) 或 WordPiece）纯粹基于频率统计进行操作，忽略了文本的底层语义结构。这导致语义冗余跨度的过度tokenization和上下文连贯性的利用不足，尤其是在长上下文场景中。

Method: 提出 SemToken，一个语义感知tokenization框架，它联合减少token冗余并提高计算效率。SemToken首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，并执行局部语义聚类以合并语义等效的token。然后，它基于语义密度分配异构token粒度，从而允许在内容丰富的区域中进行更细粒度的tokenization，并在重复或低熵跨度中进行更粗糙的压缩。

Result: 在长上下文语言建模基准（例如 WikiText-103 和 LongBench）上的实验表明，SemToken 在 token 计数方面实现了高达 2.4 倍的减少和 1.9 倍的加速，而困惑度和下游准确性方面的下降可忽略不计或没有下降。

Conclusion: 语义结构为优化大型语言模型中的tokenization和计算提供了一个有希望的新维度。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

*Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-PRM, a domain-specialized reward model for financial reasoning, outperforms general PRMs and improves downstream model performance in financial tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or STEM domains and fall short in domain-specific contexts such as finance.

Method: A domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM (Fin-PRM) is introduced to evaluate intermediate reasoning steps in financial tasks, integrating step-level and trajectory-level reward supervision.

Result: Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality, with downstream models trained with Fin-PRM yielding gains of 12.9% in supervised learning, 5.2% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1% in test-time performance.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized reward modeling is valuable for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Fin-PRM outperforms general-purpose PRMs and strong domain baselines, leading to substantial improvements in downstream models.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

*Huanxuan Liao,Yixing Xu,Shizhu He,Guanchen Li,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK 是一种通过在通道级别剪枝 KV 缓存来减少内存使用量的方法，它在长序列处理中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 中的长上下文推理越来越多地受到 KV 缓存瓶颈的限制：内存使用量随着序列长度线性增长，而注意力计算则呈二次方增长。现有方法通过令牌驱逐或合并等策略沿时间轴压缩 KV 缓存来解决此问题，以减少内存和计算开销。然而，这些方法通常忽略了特征维度（即通道轴）上的细粒度重要性变化，从而限制了它们有效平衡效率和模型准确性的能力。

Method: SPARK，一种无需训练的即插即用方法，它通过在通道级别剪枝 KV 应用非结构化稀疏性，并在注意力分数计算期间动态恢复剪枝条目。

Result: 对于相同长度的序列，与基于驱逐的方法相比，SPARK 不仅可以保持或提高模型准确性，还可以减少超过 30% 的 KV 缓存存储。

Conclusion: SPARK 通过在通道级别剪枝 KV 并动态恢复剪枝条目，减少了通道级别的冗余，从而在相同的内存预算内处理更长的序列。即使采用 80% 的激进剪枝率，SPARK 也能保持性能，与基线驱逐方法相比，性能下降小于 5%，证明了其稳健性和有效性。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

TL;DR: S2K 是一种经济高效的框架，它通过选择性微调和自选择策略来内化领域知识，从而优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在通用 QA 中表现良好，但通常在特定领域的场景中表现不佳。检索增强生成 (RAG) 引入了外部知识，但由于检索嘈杂而导致幻觉和延迟。持续的预训练使领域知识内在化，但成本高昂且缺乏跨领域灵活性。我们将这一挑战归因于领域知识的长尾分布，这使得部分但有用的内部知识未得到充分利用。我们进一步认为，知识获取应该是渐进的，模仿人类的学习：首先理解概念，然后将它们应用于复杂的推理。

Method: 通过内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调，S2K 是一种经济高效的框架，可以通过该框架内化领域知识。我们还引入了一个结构化的推理数据生成管道，并集成了 GRPO 以增强推理能力。

Result: S2K在医疗、法律和金融 QA 基准测试中始终优于现有方法，并且以显着更低的成本与领域预训练的 LLM 相匹配。

Conclusion: S2K在医疗、法律和金融 QA 基准测试中始终优于现有方法，并且以显着更低的成本与领域预训练的 LLM 相匹配。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

TL;DR: SEER通过从动态更新的经验池中学习，提高了大型语言模型在复杂工具使用场景中的性能，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著的成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步骤工具使用中，面临工具选择、参数生成和工具链规划的挑战。现有方法依赖于手动设计的特定任务演示或从精选库中检索，需要大量专家工作，并且随着工具多样性和任务难度的增加，prompt工程变得越来越复杂和低效。

Method: 提出了一种名为Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER) 的自引导方法，该方法从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度的逐步检索。

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单问题上平均提高了6.1%，在难题上平均提高了4.7%。在τ-bench上，由Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-72B模型驱动，SEER分别 демонстрирует显著的准确性提升7.44%和23.38%。

Conclusion: SEER在ToolQA和τ-bench基准测试中表现出显著的准确性提升，证明了其在复杂工具使用场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effectiveness of checklists in evaluating generative tasks using large language models, finding that selective checklist use improves pairwise evaluation but has inconsistent benefits for direct scoring. The study also reveals potential inconsistencies in human evaluation, highlighting the need for clearer evaluation criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored.

Method: automatic checklist generation using six methods

Result: effectiveness across eight model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human evaluations. Experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring tasks.

Conclusion: Selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in direct scoring. Even checklist items with low correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human and automatic evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor 是一种用于减小小型语言模型中词汇相关组件内存占用量的新框架，它通过动态词汇选择和混合策略，在几乎不影响性能的情况下显著减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型 (SLM) 在资源受限的环境中具有计算优势，但内存限制仍然是边缘设备部署的关键瓶颈。SLM 的大部分内存占用源于词汇相关组件，特别是嵌入和语言建模 (LM) 头，这是由于词汇量大造成的。现有的静态词汇修剪虽然减少了内存使用量，但存在设计僵化、一刀切的问题，导致预填充阶段的信息丢失，并且缺乏灵活性。

Method: VocabTailor，一种新颖的解耦动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入来解决内存限制，并为 LM Head 实施混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，从而能够按需加载词汇组件。

Result: VocabTailor 实现了词汇相关组件高达 99% 的内存使用量减少，同时任务性能几乎没有下降，大大优于现有的静态词汇修剪方法。

Conclusion: VocabTailor 实现了词汇相关组件高达 99% 的内存使用量减少，同时任务性能几乎没有下降，大大优于现有的静态词汇修剪方法。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

*Lekshmi R Nair,Arun Sankar,Koninika Pal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pipeline to extract temporal commonsense, creates the TComQA dataset, and shows that models trained on it outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the creation of robust language models because LLMs struggle in generating text that require reasoning with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text

Method: propose a temporal commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs

Result: TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing and achieves over 80% precision in extracting temporal commonsense

Conclusion: The model trained with TComQA outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on an existing dataset.

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

Conclusion: Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using translated data, showing the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data to improve LLM alignment in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching (CS) poses significant challenges for multilingual speech technology.  Systems capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of suitable datasets. The paper aims to resolve the dataset scarcity issue.

Method: Utilizes Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS) algorithm to generate CS speech by replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts of speech.  The UniCoM pipeline is used to construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS).

Result: Constructed Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech-to-text translation (S2TT).

Conclusion: CS-FLEURS achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics.  The approach is expected to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual systems.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangla faces digital under-representation due to limited resources and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages like Bangla.

Method: Conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches.

Result: Highlights a significant gap in the existing literature, the discontinuity from previous research, the scarcity of accessible implementations, and critiques the evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: Advocates for robust Bangla stemmers and continued research to enhance language analysis and processing.

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict.

Method: introducing Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation (CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward the more reliable knowledge source.

Result: CARE effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks

Conclusion: CARE effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many speech processing tasks require pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated our development of CUPE

Method: CUPE processes short, fixed-width windows independently

Conclusion: effective universal speech processing is possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length windows

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparing KGC models across multiple datasets and metrics is challenging due to inconsistencies and conflicting rankings.

Method: KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS)

Result: EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR demonstrate the effectiveness of EDAS.

Conclusion: KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Conclusion: 当前基准测试存在数据污染导致的分数膨胀、文化和语言偏见导致的不公平评估，以及缺乏对过程可信度和动态环境的评估

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

TL;DR: MultiTrust-X benchmark reveals trustworthiness vulnerabilities in MLLMs. RESA improves safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trustworthiness of MLLMs is a concern, and existing approaches are narrow and overlook risks introduced by multimodality.

Method: Propose MultiTrust-X, a benchmark with a three-dimensional framework, including 32 tasks and 28 datasets for holistic evaluations and in-depth analysis.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal vulnerabilities in current models and limitations in existing mitigation strategies. Reasoning improves safety and performance.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have significant vulnerabilities, with mitigation strategies often introducing trade-offs. A Reasoning-Enhanced Safety Alignment (RESA) approach improves trustworthiness.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### [30] [Confidence-Modulated Speculative Decoding for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15371)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a confidence-modulated drafting method for speculative decoding, which dynamically adjusts the number of generated tokens and verification process based on uncertainty measures. It achieves significant speedups with maintained or improved performance in machine translation and summarization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing methods rely on static drafting lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across varying model uncertainties and input complexities

Method: an information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each iteration. Additionally, the verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens

Result: Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or improving BLEU and ROUGE scores.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a principled, plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under varying conditions of uncertainty.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

### [31] [Exploiting Vocabulary Frequency Imbalance in Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15390)
*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 更大的词汇量通过降低常见词的不确定性来减少交叉熵，从而提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用tokenizers进行训练，由此产生的token分布高度不平衡：少数单词主导了数据流，而大多数单词很少出现。最近的做法倾向于越来越大的词汇量，但这种好处的来源尚不清楚。

Method: 通过在保持数据、计算和优化固定的情况下，将语言模型的词汇量从24K扩展到196K来进行受控研究。量化了token化文本的复杂性，并通过Kolmogorov复杂性进行形式化，并表明更大的词汇量降低了这种复杂性。通过词级损失分解来分析不同词汇量大小对损失的影响。限制输入和输出嵌入范数以减弱token频率不平衡的影响。

Result: 更大的词汇量降低了token化文本的复杂性。在24K以上，每个常见词都已经是一个token，因此进一步的增长主要加深了相对token频率的不平衡。词级损失分解表明，更大的词汇量几乎完全通过降低2500个最常见词的不确定性来减少交叉熵，即使罕见尾部的损失上升。因为相同的常见词覆盖了下游基准测试中大约77%的token，所以这种训练优势完整地转移了。

Conclusion: 更大的词汇量通过降低最常见词的不确定性来减少交叉熵，从而提高性能。通过限制输入和输出嵌入范数来减弱token频率不平衡的影响会逆转这种增益，直接表明该模型利用了而不是遭受了不平衡。扩大具有固定词汇量的模型参数也会产生相同的常见词优势。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to

benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics

*Cheng Wang,Gelei Deng,Xianglin Yang,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LALMs在音频和文本信息冲突时更信任文本，这会损害其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型(LALMs)增强了音频感知能力，能够有效地处理和理解结合了音频和文本的多模态输入。然而，它们在处理音频和文本模态之间冲突信息方面的性能在很大程度上仍未得到检验。

Method: 提出了MCR-BENCH，一个综合性的基准测试，专门用于评估LALMs在面对不一致的音频-文本对时如何优先排序信息。

Result: 揭示了一个令人担忧的现象：当模态之间存在不一致时，LALMs表现出对文本输入的显著偏见，经常忽略音频证据。这种倾向导致以音频为中心的任务的性能大幅下降，并引起了对现实世界应用的重要可靠性担忧。

Conclusion: LALMs在处理不一致的音频文本对时，会显著偏向文本输入，忽略音频证据，导致音频任务性能下降。需要改进训练中的模态平衡和更复杂的融合机制。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

TL;DR: LLaSO是第一个完全开放的、端到端的语音语言建模框架，它提供数据、基准和模型，以促进LSLM研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语音语言模型(LSLM)的开发因架构分散和缺乏透明度而受到阻碍，从而阻碍了研究的系统比较和可重复性。与视觉语言领域不同，LSLM领域存在一个普遍现象，即在不发布相应训练数据和配置的情况下发布模型权重。

Method: 构建并发布了一个3.8B参数的参考模型LLaSO-Base，该模型完全基于公共数据进行训练。

Result: LLaSO-Base的标准化得分为0.72，建立了一个强大的、可重复的基线，超过了同类模型。分析表明，虽然更广泛的训练覆盖可以提高性能，但在未见过的任务上，特别是在纯音频场景中，仍然存在显著的泛化差距。

Conclusion: LLaSO通过发布完整的数据、基准和模型，建立了一个基础的开放标准，以统一研究工作并加速LSLM中社区驱动的进展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

The dataset goes beyond traditional labels by identifying not only help-seeking
activity but also specific mental health disorders and their underlying causes,
such as relationship challenges or financial stressors. AI models trained on
M-Help can address three key tasks: identifying help-seekers, diagnosing mental
health conditions, and uncovering the root causes of issues.

Method: PyTOD生成可执行代码来跟踪对话状态，并使用策略和执行反馈进行有效的错误纠正。PyTOD采用了一种简单的约束解码方法，使用语言模型代替语法规则来遵循API模式。

Result: PyTOD在具有挑战性的SGD基准上实现了最先进的状态跟踪性能。

Conclusion: PyTOD在对话过程中超越了强大的基线，在准确性和稳健的用户目标估计方面都表现出色，证明了执行感知状态跟踪的有效性。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,

TL;DR: RadReason 是一种用于放射学报告的新型评估框架，它输出细粒度的子分数和人类可读的理由，在 ReXVal 基准测试中优于所有先前的离线指标，并且与基于 GPT-4 的评估达到同等水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏临床基础、可解释和细粒度的指标，评估自动生成的放射学报告仍然是一项根本性的挑战。现有方法要么产生粗略的总体分数，要么依赖于不透明的黑盒模型，限制了它们在现实世界临床工作流程中的实用性。

Method: RadReason 建立在 Group Relative Policy Optimization 的基础上，并结合了两个关键创新：(1) 子分数动态加权，它根据实时 F1 统计自适应地优先考虑临床上具有挑战性的错误类型；(2) 多数引导优势缩放，它根据从子分数协议导出的提示难度来调整策略梯度更新。

Result: RadReason 不仅输出跨六种临床定义的错误类型的细粒度子分数，而且还生成人类可读的理由，解释每个分数背后的理由。

Conclusion: RadReason 在 ReXVal 基准测试中优于所有先前的离线指标，并且与基于 GPT-4 的评估达到同等水平，同时保持可解释性、成本效益和适用于临床部署。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 个性化营销已成为提高客户参与度和推动业务增长的关键策略。先前的研究表明，执行良好的个性化策略可以将收入提高多达 40%，这突显了开发智能的、数据驱动的报价生成方法的重要性。

Method: 通过微调预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型（Google 的 T5-Small 60M），使用对比学习方法开发了个性化报价生成的生成式 AI 模型 SLM4Offer。SLM4Offer 采用 InfoNCE 损失，以在共享嵌入空间中将客户角色与相关报价对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，报价接受率比监督微调基线提高了 17%，突显了对比目标在推进个性化营销方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SLM4Offer 模型在个性化营销中，通过对比学习目标，实现了比监督微调基线高 17% 的报价接受率，证明了其在推进个性化营销方面的有效性。

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Motivation: question the perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic browsing of websites or apps

Method: clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model)

Result: a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs

Conclusion: HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters, and a higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved alignment.

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved

*Loris Schoenegger,Lukas Thoma,Terra Blevins,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Curriculum learning becomes competitive if we replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curriculum learning has shown limited success for pre-training language models

Method: sorting training examples by their training data influence

Result: Models trained on our curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10 percentage points in benchmarks

Conclusion: curriculum learning is beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric notion of difficulty is adopted

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

TL;DR: 创建了首个多标签希伯来语社会身份检测语料库 (HebID)，并使用希伯来语调整的 LLM 获得了最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的群体和身份检测数据集主要以英语为中心，单标签，并且侧重于粗略的身份类别。政治语言与社会身份密切相关，而社会身份通常受特定文化背景的影响，并通过特定的语言使用来表达。

Method: 创建了第一个多标签希伯来语语料库 HebID，用于社会身份检测，包含 5,536 句来自以色列政治家 Facebook 帖子的句子，并手动注释了 12 个细微的社会身份。

Result: 希伯来语调整的 LLM 提供了最佳结果 (macro-$F_1$ = 0.74)。将分类器应用于政治家 Facebook 帖子和议会演讲，评估了身份表达在受欢迎程度、时间趋势、聚类模式和性别相关变化方面的差异。

Conclusion: HebID语料库为研究希伯来语中的社会身份提供了全面的基础，并可作为其他非英语政治背景下类似研究的模型。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a structured prediction framework to replace Soft-argmax for facial landmark detection. The method achieves state-of-the-art results with faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: revisit the long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the only way to achieve strong performance.

Method: an alternative training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework

Result: achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像分类方法，该方法结合了GCN和Voronoi图，以提高效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCNs为处理复杂数据结构提供了强大的框架，图像分类的快速进展主要由GCNs的采用所驱动。

Method: 集成了GCNs与Voronoi图，将图像表示为图，并使用Delaunay三角剖分优化图的表示。

Result: 在各种基准数据集上，预处理效率和分类精度均有显着提高，尤其是在复杂场景和细粒度类别中。

Conclusion: 结合GCNs与Voronoi图在图像分类中有效，并在复杂场景和细粒度类别上超越了现有方法，扩展了图学习在计算机视觉中的应用。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces YOPO, a single-stage, query-based framework for category-level 9-DoF pose estimation from a single RGB image. It achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the category level

Method: a single-stage, query-based framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of 2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost.

Result: it achieves 79.6% $\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric on the REAL275 dataset

Conclusion: YOPO sets a new state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6% $\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems.

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified approach for detecting both physical and digital face spoofing attacks, achieving state-of-the-art results with a lightweight and efficient framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern face recognition systems are vulnerable to both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries, and traditionally these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models, increasing system complexity and leaving systems exposed to combined attack vectors.

Method: The paper proposes a unified training approach called Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework that leverages automatically matched pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.

Result: The proposed method achieves an ACER of 2.10 percent on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital Attack Detection benchmark. The framework is lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour.

Conclusion: The proposed Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital Attack Detection benchmark, with an ACER of 2.10 percent.

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种高效的对抗图像生成方法，它利用扩散模型，通过少量采样步骤和选择性的RGB通道策略，在保证图像质量的同时，实现了高成功率的攻击，并且对防御机制具有很强的抵抗性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成模型对抗攻击通常产生低质量图像且需要大量计算资源，而扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但对抗生成通常需要数百个采样步骤。

Method: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒方法，通过在混合步骤间隔中注入扰动，并结合选择性的RGB通道策略，利用无条件扩散模型生成对抗图像。

Result: TAIGen仅需3-20个采样步骤即可生成对抗样本，在ImageNet上针对不同模型取得了70.6%到97.8%的攻击成功率，速度比现有基于扩散的攻击快10倍，并且实现了最低的鲁棒准确率。

Conclusion: TAIGen在保持视觉质量的同时，能够高效且具有影响力地生成对抗样本，对防御机制的抵抗性强。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

TL;DR: RUN++ 是一种用于隐藏视觉感知的可逆展开网络，它利用扩散模型来处理不确定区域，并在实际退化下保持有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐藏视觉感知 (CVP) 方法通常利用可逆策略来减少不确定性，但这些策略通常仅限于掩码域，RGB 域的潜力未得到充分挖掘。

Method: 提出了一种具有生成细化的可逆展开网络 RUN++，该网络将 CVP 任务 формулируется 为数学优化问题，并将迭代解决方案展开为多阶段深度网络。每个阶段包含 CORE、CARE 和 FINE 三个模块。

Result: RUN++ 能够高效地处理不确定区域，显著减少假阳性和假阴性。引入了一种构建鲁棒 CVP 系统的新范例，该系统在实际退化下仍然有效，并将这一概念扩展到更广泛的双层优化框架中。

Conclusion: RUN++ 通过展开网络和扩散模型的协同作用，能够高效地处理不确定区域，显著减少假阳性和假阴性。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

TL;DR: CurveFlow 是一种新的流动匹配框架，通过引入曲率引导来学习平滑的非线性轨迹，从而提高文本到图像生成的语义一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的修正流动模型基于数据和噪声分布之间的线性轨迹。这种线性强制零曲率，可能会无意中迫使图像生成过程通过数据流形的低概率区域。一个关键问题仍未得到充分探索：这些轨迹的曲率与生成的图像及其相应标题之间的语义对齐（即指令依从性）如何相关？

Method: 提出 CurveFlow，一种新颖的流动匹配框架，旨在通过将曲率引导直接纳入流动路径来学习平滑的非线性轨迹。该方法采用鲁棒的曲率正则化技术，惩罚轨迹内在动力学的突变。

Result: 在 MS COCO 2014 和 2017 上的大量实验表明，CurveFlow 在文本到图像生成方面实现了最先进的性能，显著优于标准修正流动变体和其他非线性基线（如修正扩散）。改进在语义一致性指标（如 BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE 和 CLAIR）中尤其明显。

Conclusion: CurveFlow通过引入曲率感知建模，显著提高了模型在保持高图像质量的同时，忠实地遵循复杂指令的能力。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据集偏差和对主观标签的依赖继续阻碍了它们（无参考图像质量评估 (NR-IQA)）的泛化性能。

Method: HiRQA，分层排序和质量对齐），一个自我监督的、与意见无关的框架，通过结合排序和对比学习，提供分层的、质量感知的嵌入。

Result: HiRQA推广到真实的降级，通过对各种失真的评估证明，如镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊和低光条件。对于实时部署，我们引入了 HiRQA-S，一个轻量级的变体，每个图像的推理时间仅为 3.5 毫秒。

Conclusion: HiRQA在合成和真实基准测试中验证了最先进的 (SOTA) 性能、强大的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于投资组合理论的边缘资源管理策略，用于在系统中断下实现可靠的多视图3D重建，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图3D重建应用正在彻底改变需要快速态势感知的关键用例，例如应急响应、战术场景和公共安全。在许多情况下，它们近乎实时的延迟要求和对计算资源的临时需求需要采用“Just-in-time”边缘环境，其中系统是动态设置的，以在任务生命周期内支持应用程序。然而，可靠性问题可能源于这种边缘环境的内在动态性和操作不利因素，导致时空相关的中断，这些中断会影响相机操作，从而导致重建质量的持续下降。

Method: 使用遗传算法解决投资组合理论优化问题。

Result: 使用公开可用的和定制的3D数据集，我们证明了所提出的相机选择策略在保证可靠的3D重建方面优于传统的基线策略，尤其是在时空中断下。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的投资组合理论启发的边缘资源管理策略，用于在可能的系统中断下实现可靠的多视图3D重建。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在DR检测中缺乏透明性和可解释性，阻碍了临床应用。

Method: 集成了专用医学视觉编码器和LVLM核心，并采用多任务提示工程和多阶段微调。

Result: 在DDR数据集上实现了最先进的性能，疾病诊断的平衡准确率为84.55%，F1分数为79.92%，概念检测的平衡准确率为77.95%，F1分数为66.88%。人类评估确认了解释的高流畅性、准确性和临床实用性。

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM在DR诊断和概念检测方面表现出色，并通过生成高质量的解释弥合了自动化诊断和临床需求之间的差距。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网格模型在越来越多的城市中变得越来越容易获得；然而，缺乏真实的纹理限制了它们在虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种名为MeSS（基于网格的场景合成）的方法，用于生成高质量、风格一致的室外场景，其中城市网格模型作为几何先验。

Result: 该方法通过使用级联外绘ControlNets生成几何上一致的稀疏视图，然后通过名为AGInpaint的组件传播更密集的中间视图，并使用GCAlign模块全局消除视觉不一致性（例如，不同的曝光），从而增强图像扩散模型，从而改进跨视图一致性。与生成同时，通过在网格表面上初始化高斯球来重建3D高斯溅射（3DGS）场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在几何对齐和生成质量方面优于现有方法。合成后，可以通过重新照明和风格转换技术以不同的风格渲染场景。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

TL;DR: Introduces SurgWound, the first open-source surgical wound dataset and benchmark, and proposes WoundQwen, a three-stage learning framework for surgical wound diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common and costly healthcare-associated infection. Progress in using deep learning for surgical wound screening is hindered by data privacy concerns and high annotation costs. There's a lack of a public dataset and open-source tool for surgical wound screening.

Method: A three-stage learning framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, five independent MLLMs predict surgical wound characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as knowledge inputs to two MLLMs for diagnosing outcomes. In the third stage, a MLLM integrates the diagnostic results to produce a comprehensive report.

Result: The paper introduces SurgWound, the first open-source dataset of surgical wound images, and a benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, including VQA and report generation tasks.

Conclusion: A three-stage learning framework, WoundQwen, can analyze detailed surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Conclusion: DyMorph-B2I 优于单独的经典方法和简单组合，可以实现卓越的实例分离，并有助于在肾脏病理工作流程中进行更准确的形态测量分析。

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Conclusion: STAGNet模型在三个公开数据集上进行的实验表明，无论是在给定的数据集上进行交叉验证，还是在不同的数据集上进行训练和测试，该模型都比以前的方法实现了更高的平均精度和平均碰撞时间值。

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriMM is a feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from multi-modalities (RGB, RGBD, and point cloud) to generate high-quality 3D assets with enhanced texture and geometric detail, achieving competitive performance even with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing 3D-native generative architectures either operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms or restrict themselves to 3D structures, limiting the scope of available training datasets.

Method: TriMM introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision, and a triplane latent diffusion model.

Result: TriMM achieves superior quality in generating 3D assets, enhancing both the texture and the geometric detail. It also achieves competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite utilizing a small amount of training data.

Conclusion: TriMM effectively leverages multi-modality to achieve competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite utilizing a small amount of training data. It also demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的聚类框架，该框架使用软原型对比模块和双重一致性学习模块，在五个数据集上优于 SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习因其判别性表示而被广泛应用于聚类任务中。然而，类之间的冲突问题很难有效解决。现有的方法试图通过原型对比来解决这个问题，但是硬原型的计算与真实的聚类中心之间存在偏差。

Method: 一个以中心为导向的原型对比聚类框架，该框架由一个软原型对比模块和一个双重一致性学习模块组成。

Result: 软原型对比模块使用样本属于聚类中心的概率作为权重来计算每个类别的原型，同时避免类间冲突，减少原型漂移。双重一致性学习模块分别对齐同一样本的不同变换和不同样本的邻域，确保特征具有变换不变的语义信息和紧凑的簇内分布，同时为原型的计算提供可靠的保证。

Conclusion: 在五个数据集上的大量实验表明，与 SOTA 相比，该方法是有效的。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Motivation: Achieving reliable UAV-VLN performance is challenging due to extended trajectories and complex maneuverability, often requiring human intervention or overly detailed instructions. This paper aims to harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility for multi-grained perspectives while maintaining a manageable motion space for learning.

Method: The paper proposes a dual-UAV collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, with a high-altitude UAV using Pilot-LLM and a low-altitude UAV using a multi-stage policy.

Result: The paper introduces the HaL-13k dataset and the AeroDuo framework to support the training and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN task.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a dual-UAV collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where a high-altitude UAV uses a multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, and a low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and target grounding. The two UAVs collaborate efficiently by exchanging minimal coordinate information.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces skipped-step sampling to accelerate diffusion model inference while maintaining high generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have a drawback in their sequential generation process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. There remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian processes.

Method: The paper introduces skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps in the iterative generation process.

Result: The proposed method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling steps on popular pretrained diffusion models.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. The proposed method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling steps.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Result: The proposed Comp-X demonstrates impressive textual interaction capability and maintains comparable compression performance.

Conclusion: Comp-X can understand coding requests efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability, while maintaining comparable compression performance.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue

built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and
provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two
lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization,
outperforming competing models.

Conclusion: RATopo策略可以无缝集成到现有的拓扑推理框架中，持续提高lane-lane和lane-traffic的拓扑性能。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

*Darya Taratynova,Alya Almsouti,Beknur Kalmakhanbet,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) for fetal CHD classification in ultrasound videos, improving accuracy and calibration using temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not account for prediction calibration.

Method: Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies classification uncertainty.

Result: achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to 58.62%).

Conclusion: Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RAG-SEG，一种无训练的COD方法，它使用检索增强生成（RAG）生成提示，然后使用SAM进行分割细化，在个人笔记本电脑上实现了具有竞争力的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对象和背景之间的高度相似性，伪装对象检测（COD）在计算机视觉中提出了一个重大挑战。现有方法通常依赖于繁重的训练和大量的计算资源。虽然诸如Segment Anything Model（SAM）等基础模型提供了强大的泛化能力，但如果没有微调，它们仍然难以处理COD任务，并且需要高质量的提示才能产生良好的性能。然而，手动生成此类提示的成本高昂且效率低下。

Method: 提出了一种无训练范式，将COD解耦为两个阶段：用于生成粗糙掩码作为提示的检索增强生成（RAG），然后是基于SAM的分割（SEG）用于细化。RAG-SEG通过无监督聚类构建了一个紧凑的检索数据库，实现了快速有效的特征检索。在推理过程中，检索到的特征产生伪标签，这些伪标签使用SAM2指导精确的掩码生成。

Result: RAG-SEG的性能与现有技术水平的方法相当或超过。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG在基准COD数据集上表现与现有最佳方法相当或超过，所有实验均在个人笔记本电脑上进行，突出了该方法的计算效率和实用性。附录中提供了进一步的分析，包括局限性、显著目标检测扩展和可能的改进。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

TL;DR: VideoEraser是一种免训练框架，可防止T2V扩散模型生成具有不良概念的视频，即使在明确提示这些概念时也是如此。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于文本到视频（T2V）扩散模型可能被滥用于生成有害或误导性内容，因此引起了人们对隐私、版权和安全的担忧。这些模型通常在大量数据集上进行训练，包括未经授权的个人身份、艺术创作和有害材料，这可能导致此类内容的 uncontrolled production 和传播。

Method: VideoEraser，一个免训练框架，通过选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）和对抗性噪声引导（ARNG）的两阶段过程，无缝集成到代表性的T2V扩散模型中。

Result: 在四个任务（包括对象擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和显式内容擦除）中进行了广泛的评估。实验结果表明，在功效、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面，VideoEraser始终优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: VideoEraser在抑制T2V生成过程中不良内容方面实现了最先进的性能，与基线相比，在四个任务上的平均降低了46%。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

TL;DR: Systematic study of Video-LLMs' internal mechanisms using attention knockouts, revealing insights into layer functionality and attention reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited understanding of the internal mechanisms of Video-LLMs despite their strong video question answering capabilities.

Method: Attention knockouts (Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and Language-to-Video Knockout) on different layers.

Result: Key findings: 1) Video information extraction occurs in early layers; 2) Certain intermediate layers have an outsized impact; 3) Spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval.

Conclusion: This study uncovers how Video-LLMs process and understand video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives.

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

Motivation: 现有的3DGS压缩方法存在两个局限性：(1) 它们仅将中等规模的场景压缩到兆字节范围，这对于大规模场景或广泛的场景集合仍然是不切实际的；(2) 它们缺乏适应长期存档后场景变化的机制。

Method: 我们提出了一个图像条件高斯溅射量化器（ICGS-Quantizer），它通过共同利用高斯间和属性间的相关性，并使用跨所有训练场景的共享码本，从而提高量化效率。在解码时，ICGS-Quantizer根据捕获的图像调节场景解码。

Result: ICGS-Quantizer有效地将3DGS的存储需求降低到千字节范围，同时保持了视觉保真度。

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和适应场景变化方面始终优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: DriveSplat, a high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling, achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric representation.

Method: a high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near, middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation. Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors, whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network. The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures.

Result: demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Conclusion: The method has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,

TL;DR: This paper analyzes why the DIO model fails to solve RPM problems effectively and proposes three improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unresolved bottleneck in abstract reasoning of current deep learning models, using Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as a benchmark.

Method: The paper adopts a ``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes $\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency $\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture of the baseline model DIO is designed.

Result: Experiments reveal that the optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option, fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning logic.

Conclusion: This paper identifies limitations in the DIO model for solving RPM problems, specifically its failure to genuinely acquire human reasoning logic due to the tightness of the lower bound in mutual information maximization and the inability of mutual information to capture causal relationships. To address these limitations, the paper proposes three progressive improvement methods.

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Motivation: MAEs require extensive hyperparameter tuning when applied to novel datasets, and the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on downstream tasks is relatively unexplored.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE

TL;DR: BIRD: A bidirectional temporal propagation method for moving infrared small target detection, outperforming existing methods with faster speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based multi-frame methods use sliding windows, ignoring joint optimization and global temporal information, leading to redundant computation and sub-optimal performance.

Method: A Bidirectional temporal information propagation method (BIRD) with Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) and Global Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) modules, jointly optimized by detection loss and Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) loss.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and fast inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed BIRD method achieves state-of-the-art performance and fast inference speed.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究系统地研究了输入分辨率对三种突出的基于深度学习的人脸检测器（YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN）的准确性和鲁棒性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸检测是许多人工智能驱动的应用中的一个关键组成部分，例如监控、生物特征认证和人机交互。然而，低分辨率图像等现实条件带来了显著的挑战，降低了检测性能。

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，我们对多个图像分辨率（160x160、320x320和640x640）进行了广泛的评估，并使用精确率、召回率、mAP50、mAP50-95和推理时间等指标评估了每个模型的性能。

Result: 结果表明，YOLOv11在检测精度方面优于YOLOv12和MTCNN，尤其是在较高分辨率下，而YOLOv12表现出稍微好一点的召回率。MTCNN虽然在landmark定位方面有竞争力，但在实时推理速度方面滞后。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning solution using YOLOv8 to automatically detect microscopic dents on car exteriors, improving speed and precision compared to manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing car damage inspection is labor-intensive and misses microscopic imperfections.

Method: Utilized YOLOv8 object recognition framework with custom dataset and real-time data augmentation.

Result: YOLOv8m-t42 model achieved 0.86 precision, 0.84 recall, and 0.85 F1-score, outperforming YOLOv8m-t4.

Conclusion: YOLOv8m-t42 demonstrates superior accuracy for dent detection, making it suitable for practical applications despite slower convergence.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频到视频时刻检索(Vid2VidMR)需要语义帧级别对齐和建模查询和目标视频之间的复杂依赖关系。

Method: 双阶段序列对齐的Transformer模型（MATR）。

Result: MATR在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上，R@1提升13.1%，mIoU提升8.1%。在SportsMoments数据集上，R@1提升14.7%，mIoU提升14.4%。

Conclusion: MATR在ActivityNet-VRL和SportsMoments数据集上显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的 SfM-free 3DGS 方法，用于从极稀疏视图中进行相机姿态估计和 3D 重建，通过密集立体模块、相干视图插值和多尺度正则化来提高几何结构和渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) 在新视角合成中表现出了卓越的实时性能，但其有效性在很大程度上依赖于具有精确已知相机姿势的密集多视图输入，这在现实场景中很少见。当输入视图变得非常稀疏时，3DGS 依赖于初始化的 Structure-from-Motion (SfM) 方法无法准确地重建场景的 3D 几何结构，从而导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于 SfM-free 3DGS 的方法，该方法可以从极稀疏视图输入中联合估计相机姿势并重建 3D 场景。具体来说，我们提出了一种密集立体模块，以逐步估计相机姿势信息并重建用于初始化的全局密集点云，而不是 SfM。我们提出了一种相干视图插值模块，该模块基于训练视图对插值相机姿势，并生成视点一致的内容作为额外的训练监督信号。此外，我们引入了多尺度拉普拉斯一致正则化和自适应空间感知多尺度几何正则化，以提高几何结构和渲染内容的质量。

Result: 该方法在极稀疏视图条件下显著优于其他最先进的基于3DGS的方法，在使用仅2个训练视图的情况下，PSNR 实现了显著的 2.75dB 改进。该方法合成的图像表现出最小的失真，同时保留了丰富的高频细节，与现有技术相比具有卓越的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在极稀疏视图条件下显著优于其他最先进的基于3DGS的方法，在使用仅2个训练视图的情况下，PSNR 实现了显著的 2.75dB 改进。该方法合成的图像表现出最小的失真，同时保留了丰富的高频细节，与现有技术相比具有卓越的视觉质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

Motivation: 现有的轻量级模型通常以牺牲性能来换取效率，并且很少采用计算成本高的注意力机制，严重限制了它们的全局上下文感知能力。此外，当前的架构忽略了医学成像中相同卷积核下的通道冗余问题，这阻碍了有效的特征提取。

Method: LGMSNet采用异构层内核来提取局部高频信息，同时减轻通道冗余。此外，该模型集成了稀疏transformer-卷积混合分支来捕获低频全局信息。

Result: LGMSNet在六个公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能。在四个未见数据集的zero-shot泛化测试中保持了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: LGMSNet在六个公共数据集上表现出色，并在四个未见数据集的零样本泛化测试中保持了卓越的性能，证明了其在资源有限的医疗场景中实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

Method: 我们引入了目标导向或目的状态的结构，定义为目标等效经验分布的类别。目的状态从行为策略和期望的经验特征之间的统计差异方面，为目标导向学习提供了一个简约的解释。

Conclusion: 我们提出了认知代理中有目的状态表征的计算框架，其中世界模型的描述性和规范性方面来自agent与环境的交互序列或经验。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using LLMs to control agent movement in crowds, enabling more realistic simulations with emergent group behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human navigation and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing work does not consider these dimensions.

Method: A novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to control agents' movement, with two main components: a dialogue system and language-driven navigation.

Result: Grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur, and the method serves as an information-passing mechanism within the crowd.

Conclusion: The proposed method produces more realistic crowd simulations with emergent group behaviors arising naturally from any environmental setting.

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours

TL;DR: 大型语言模型的推理预算增加会损害置信度校准，而信息获取是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 避免大型语言模型作为问答工具部署时过度自信，需要强大的校准。

Method: 使用 ClimateX 数据集，并将其扩展到人类和行星健康，系统地评估了推理能力和预算如何影响置信度评估的准确性。

Result: 增加推理预算会损害校准，扩展推理会导致系统性过度自信，而检索相关证据的搜索增强生成优于纯推理，达到 89.3% 的准确率。

Conclusion: 信息获取是提高知识密集型任务置信度校准的关键瓶颈，而不是推理深度或预算。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA 通过修剪不安全的权重更新来提高 LoRA 调整的 LLM 的安全性，而无需访问原始模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用 LoRA 等参数高效微调 (PEFT) 技术调整大型语言模型 (LLM) 已经实现了基于 LLM 的代理的强大功能。然而，这些调整可能会无意中损害安全对齐，从而导致不安全或不稳定的行为，尤其是在代理规划任务中。现有的安全感知调整方法通常需要访问基础模型和指令调整模型检查点，但在实践中通常不可用，从而限制了它们的适用性。

Method: S3LoRA，一种轻量级、无数据且与模型无关的框架，通过仅检查微调的权重更新来降低 LoRA 适配模型中的安全风险。它包括 MAS-SVD 和 SSI。

Result: S3LoRA 在代理规划和语言生成任务中持续改进安全指标，同时保持或改进效用指标，并显着降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA 是一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，可在资源受限和安全至关重要的现实环境中安全地部署基于 LLM 的代理。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Motivation: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting, the paper introduces Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce PuzzleClone

Method: a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction mechanism.

Result: Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges to current state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Training on PuzzleClone yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from 52.5 to 65.0).

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical

span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and

TL;DR: LLM4Sweat is the first open-source LLM framework for hyperhidrosis, addressing data scarcity with a three-stage pipeline of data augmentation, fine-tuning, and expert evaluation. It outperforms baselines and offers a generalizable approach for other rare diseases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying LLMs to rare medical conditions like hyperhidrosis is hindered by scarce and unreliable datasets. Hyperhidrosis affects 2-3% of the population and impacts well-being, yet no LLMs have been tailored for it.

Method: a three-stage pipeline: data augmentation using a frontier LLM to generate synthetic vignettes, fine-tuning an open-source foundation model on the augmented dataset, and expert evaluation to iteratively enrich the dataset.

Result: LLM4Sweat outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: LLM4Sweat outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench是一个评估LLM在资源约束项目调度问题（RCPSP）上的性能的框架。研究表明，约束交互是LLM性能的主要瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高约束条件下进行有效调度是跨部门大规模规划的基础，例如资本项目、制造、物流和IT舰队转型。然而，大型语言模型（LLM）在高约束条件下进行推理时的可靠性尚未得到充分表征。

Method: R-ConstraintBench，一个可扩展的框架，用于评估资源约束项目调度问题（RCPSP）模型，这是一个NP完全可行性类，同时难度通过约束的线性增长而增加。R-ConstraintBench逐步增加有向无环图（DAG）中非冗余的优先级约束，然后引入停机时间、时间窗口和析取约束。

Result: 强大的模型在仅有优先级的DAG上接近上限，但是当停机时间、时间窗口和析取约束相互作用时，可行性性能会崩溃，这意味着约束交互，而不是图深度，是主要的瓶颈。在干净的合成斜坡上的性能也不能保证转移到基于领域的场景，突出了有限的泛化。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在高约束条件下推理时的可靠性不足；当停机时间、时间窗口和析取约束相互作用时，可行性性能会崩溃，这意味着约束交互，而不是图深度，是主要的瓶颈。在干净的合成斜坡上的性能也不能保证转移到基于领域的场景，突出了有限的泛化。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required for flowcharts.

Method: The system runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes edits, multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates, and a Judge VLM selects the best candidate.

Result: The method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs, accurately composing primitives without inserting unwanted text. Outputs are programmatic SVGs, readily extensible to presentation tools.

Conclusion: The paper introduces See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic system that converts rough hand sketches into precise, compositional diagrams by coupling a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The method outperforms frontier closed-source image generation LLMs in reconstructing layout and structure from flowchart sketches.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

Conclusion: The multiple memory system (MMS) effectively utilizes historical data by processing short-term memory into long-term memory fragments and constructing retrieval and contextual memory units. Experiments show its effectiveness, rationality, and robustness.

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

Result: 该模型将环境信息归纳为粗粒度的焦点，以指导训练任务中的经验收集，然后从每个经验中归纳出可操作的混合粒度提示。

Conclusion: 在推理时，该模型检索与任务相关的经验和技巧来支持规划。当面对环境异常时，LLM将当前情况归结为细粒度的关键信息，从而实现灵活的自我问答反思和计划修正。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于搜索的偏好加权（SPW）方案，以统一专家演示和偏好这两种反馈源，从而实现更准确的信用分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常依赖于定义良好的奖励函数，而奖励函数的设计既困难又昂贵。人类反馈是一种有吸引力的替代方案，但它的两种常见形式，专家演示和偏好，具有互补的局限性。演示提供逐步监督，但收集成本高昂，并且通常反映有限的专家行为模式。相比之下，偏好更容易收集，但尚不清楚行为的哪些部分对轨迹段的贡献最大，从而使信用分配悬而未决。

Method: 引入了一种基于搜索的偏好加权（SPW）方案，以统一这两种反馈源。对于偏好标记轨迹中的每个转换，SPW搜索来自专家演示的最相似状态-动作对，并直接基于它们的相似性得分导出逐步重要性权重。然后，这些权重用于指导标准偏好学习，从而实现更准确的信用分配，这是传统方法难以实现的。

Result: SPW实现了从偏好和演示中进行有效的联合学习，优于先前在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务中利用这两种反馈类型的方法。

Conclusion: SPW实现了从偏好和演示中进行有效的联合学习，优于先前在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务中利用这两种反馈类型的方法。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RETAIL, a new dataset for real-world travel planning, and proposes TGMA, a topic-guided multi-agent framework, to address the limitations of current systems in handling implicit queries, environmental factors, user preferences, and detailed POI information. Experiments show TGMA significantly outperforms existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First, they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one plans with rich details

Method: a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed TGMA

Result: even the strongest existing model achieves merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved performance 2.72%

Conclusion: TGMA demonstrates substantially improved performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel planning.

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text

handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that allows LLMs to adjust their reasoning length dynamically based on the complexity of the task, improving efficiency and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excessively long chains of thought in LLMs can lead to overthinking, computational waste, and slower responses. The paper aims to address whether LLMs can dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes based on task complexity.

Method: The paper proposes a three-stage pipeline: Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning.

Result: The paper establishes a block-structured paradigm where the model predicts a reasoning budget and partitions reasoning accordingly. The adaptive model adjusts its reasoning depth to problem difficulty and allows dynamic control of reasoning depth at inference time.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a Think in Blocks framework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust reasoning length based on task complexity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying the cooperative behavior of autonomous AI agents is increasingly relevant, inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory.

Method: We devised a virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game to simulate internal team dynamics and external competition.

Result: This blend substantially boosts both overall and initial cooperation levels.

Conclusion: Intergroup competition can lead to more cooperative behavior, which is crucial for designing future multi-agent AI systems.

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based

complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

Motivation: 全息声明性记忆(HDM)是ACT-R的声明性记忆(DM)系统的向量符号替代方案，可以带来可扩展性和DM块之间架构定义的相似性等优势。

Method: 将HDM调整为与ACT-R最全面和广泛使用的实现(Lisp ACT-R)一起使用

Result: 我们开发了基于向量的常用ACT-R函数版本，建立了一个文本处理管道，以将大型文档的内容添加到ACT-R内存中，最重要的是，创建了一种有用且新颖的机制，可以仅使用令牌的向量表示来检索整个内存块。

Conclusion: HDM可以保持向量符号的优势(例如，无需存储实际块即可进行块召回，以及缩放方面的其他优势)，同时也可以扩展它，以便以前的ACT-R模型可以在系统中使用，而无需对模型的实际过程和声明性内存部分进行少量(或可能没有)修改。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

Motivation: 为了可靠地部署多智能体强化学习（MARL）系统，理解团队中各个智能体的行为至关重要。之前的研究通常基于显式奖励信号或学习的价值函数来评估整体团队表现，但目前尚不清楚在没有任何价值反馈的情况下如何推断智能体的贡献。

Method: 提出了Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs)，一种基于信息论Shapley值的方法，用于量化每个agent对其合作者工具性赋权的影响。

Result: 通过比较策略和价值函数之间的行动效果，该方法可以识别哪些智能体行为有益于团队成功，无论是通过促进确定性决策还是通过保持未来行动选择的灵活性。在合作和竞争的MARL环境中进行的分析揭示了智能体采用相似或不同策略的程度。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解MARL系统中的合作动态和提高可解释性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

Abstract: We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine
reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be

TL;DR: 本文测量了Gemini AI助手服务的环境影响，发现其能耗低于预期，并通过软件效率和清洁能源显著降低了能耗和碳足迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户采用的加速，理解和减轻AI服务的环境影响的需求也在增加。然而，没有研究测量过生产环境中AI服务的环境指标。

Method: 提出并执行了一种综合方法，用于测量大型AI生产环境中AI推理工作负载的能源使用、碳排放和用水量。

Result: Gemini Apps文本提示的能耗中位数为0.24 Wh，低于许多公开估计。谷歌的软件效率努力和清洁能源采购在一年内使Gemini Apps文本提示的能源消耗降低了33倍，碳足迹降低了44倍。Gemini Apps文本提示的能量消耗低于观看9秒电视，用水量相当于5滴水。

Conclusion: 对AI服务的环境影响进行全面测量对于准确比较模型至关重要，并能适当地激励整个AI服务堆栈提高效率。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

TL;DR: 与AI代理的准社会关系是有害的。我们创建了一个框架来实时识别对话中的准社会线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与AI代理发展准社会关系对人类福祉有严重的影响，在某些情况下甚至是悲剧性的影响。然而，防止这种动态是具有挑战性的：准社会线索通常在私人对话中逐渐出现，并非所有形式的情感参与本质上都是有害的。

Method: 通过重新利用最先进的语言模型创建了一个简单的响应评估框架，该框架可以实时评估正在进行的对话中的准社会线索

Result: 通过五阶段测试的迭代评估成功识别了所有准社会对话，同时在宽松的一致性规则下避免了误报，检测通常发生在最初的几次交流中。

Conclusion: 评估智能体可以为预防准社会关系提供可行的解决方案

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

TL;DR: LGT 使用多智能体大型语言模型和自然语言推理来优化配置，优于传统方法，同时保持高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 配置优化仍然是机器学习中的一个关键瓶颈，需要在模型架构、训练策略、特征工程和超参数之间进行协调调整。传统方法独立地处理这些维度，缺乏可解释性，而最近的自动化方法难以适应动态适应性和对优化决策的语义推理。

Method: 引入了语言引导调整 (LGT)，这是一种新颖的框架，它采用多代理大型语言模型，通过自然语言推理来智能地优化配置。LGT 协调三个专门的代理：一个提出配置更改的顾问，一个评估进度的评估员，以及一个改进决策过程的优化器，从而创建一个自我改进的反馈循环。

Result: LGT 证明了优于传统优化方法的实质性改进，在保持高可解释性的同时实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: LGT在六个不同的数据集上进行了全面的评估，与传统的优化方法相比，LGT 取得了显著的改进，在保持高可解释性的同时实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

*Daichi Amagata*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于空间范围连接随机抽样的高效算法，该算法优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间范围连接在许多应用中都有应用，但计算成本高，结果集过大。返回连接结果的随机样本是一种缓解这些问题的实用方法，但有效计算随机样本并非易事。

Method: 提出了一种新的数据结构来解决该问题，并设计了高效的算法。

Result: 提出的算法在$\tilde{O}(n + m + t)$预期时间和$O(n+m)$空间内运行，显著优于基线算法。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在时间和空间效率上优于现有方法，通过真实空间数据集的实验验证了这一点。

Abstract: Spatial range joins have many applications, including geographic information
systems, location-based social networking services, neuroscience, and
visualization. However, joins incur not only expensive computational costs but
also too large result sets. A practical and reasonable approach to alleviating
these issues is to return random samples of the join results. Although this is
promising and sufficient for many applications involving spatial range joins,
efficiently computing random samples is not trivial. This is because we must
obtain random join samples without running spatial range joins. We address this
challenging problem for the first time and aim at designing a time- and
space-efficient algorithm. First, we design two baseline algorithms that employ
existing techniques for random sampling and show that they are not efficient.
Then, we propose a new data structure that can deal with our problem in
$\tilde{O}(n + m + t)$ expected time and $O(n+m)$ space, where $n$ and $m$ are
the sizes of two point sets and $t$ is the required number of samples. We
conduct extensive experiments using four real spatial datasets, and the results
demonstrate that our algorithm is significantly faster than the baselines in
most tests.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CoreT的新算法，用于解决时间k核查询问题，该算法通过动态记录顶点或边进入k核的最早时间戳来实现高效的计算和显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间图中查询有凝聚力的子图对于理解现实世界网络的动态结构至关重要，例如社交平台中不断发展的社区、Web上不断变化的超链接结构以及呼叫网络中瞬时的通信模式。最近，研究集中在时间$k$-core查询上，该查询旨在识别给定查询间隔内所有可能的时间子间隔中的所有$k$-core。

Method: 提出了一种名为CoreT的新算法，该算法动态记录每个顶点或边进入k核的最早时间戳。该策略能够大量修剪冗余计算，只需要对查询间隔进行一次扫描，并实现了改进的时间复杂度，该时间复杂度在查询间隔内的时间边数和间隔持续时间上都是线性的。

Result: CoreT算法的时间复杂度在查询间隔内的时间边数和间隔持续时间上都是线性的，使得它对于长期时间分析具有高度可扩展性。在大型真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，与现有的最先进的OTCD相比，CoreT实现了高达四个数量级的加速。

Conclusion: CoreT算法在时间k核分析中表现出高效性和可扩展性，通过在大型真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，与现有的最先进的OTCD相比，CoreT实现了高达四个数量级的加速。

Abstract: Querying cohesive subgraphs in temporal graphs is essential for understanding
the dynamic structure of real-world networks, such as evolving communities in
social platforms, shifting hyperlink structures on the Web, and transient
communication patterns in call networks. Recently, research has focused on the
temporal $k$-core query, which aims to identify all $k$-cores across all
possible time sub-intervals within a given query interval. The state-of-the-art
algorithm OTCD mitigates redundant computations over overlapping sub-intervals
by exploiting inclusion relationships among $k$-cores in different time
intervals. Nevertheless, OTCD remains limited in scalability due to the
combinatorial growth in interval enumeration and repeated processing. In this
paper, we revisit the temporal $k$-core query problem and introduce a novel
algorithm CoreT, which dynamically records the earliest timestamp at which each
vertex or edge enters a $k$-core. This strategy enables substantial pruning of
redundant computations. As a result, CoreT requires only a single pass over the
query interval and achieves improved time complexity, which is linear in both
the number of temporal edges within the query interval and the duration of the
interval, making it highly scalable for long-term temporal analysis.
Experimental results on large real-world datasets show that CoreT achieves up
to four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the existing state-of-the-art
OTCD, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for temporal $k$-core
analysis.

Motivation: Query ambiguity is a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL generation.

Method: an interactive system that automatically detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice questions to clarify their intent. introduces a fine-grained ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities.

Result: AmbiSQL achieves 87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by 50%.

Conclusion: AmbiSQL achieves 87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by 50%.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

TL;DR: Proposes a cloud-edge-device collaborative query processing method to improve query performance when edge resources are limited by using a collaborative scan operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It is difficult to implement collaborative operators that can flexibly switch between the cloud and the edge during query execution. Thus, in this paper, we aim to improve the query performance when the edge resources reach a bottleneck.

Method: We propose a CQ processing method by establishing a CED collaborative framework based on the collaborative scan operator.

Result: CED collaborative scan operator can effectively alleviate the performance degradation of scan operators caused by high I/O load and CPU wait time at the edge.

Conclusion: The CED collaborative scan operator can effectively alleviate the performance degradation of scan operators caused by high I/O load and CPU wait time at the edge, and achieves balanced resource scheduling between the cloud and edge.

Abstract: In cloud-edge-device (CED) collaborative query (CQ) processing, by leveraging
CED collaboration, the advantages of both cloud computing and edge resources
can be fully integrated. However, it is difficult to implement collaborative
operators that can flexibly switch between the cloud and the edge during query
execution. Thus, in this paper, we aim to improve the query performance when
the edge resources reach a bottleneck. To achieve seamless switching of query
execution between the cloud and edge, we propose a CQ processing method by
establishing a CED collaborative framework based on the collaborative scan
operator, so that query execution can be transferred to the cloud at any time
when the edge resources are saturated. Extensive experiments show that, under
sufficient network download bandwidth, the CED collaborative scan operator can
effectively alleviate the performance degradation of scan operators caused by
high I/O load and CPU wait time at the edge. It also achieves balanced resource
scheduling between the cloud and edge.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Gorgeous prioritizes graph structure over vectors, boosting average query throughput by over 60% and reducing query latency by over 35%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Similarity-based vector search underpins many important applications, but a key challenge is processing massive vector datasets (e.g., in TBs). To reduce costs, some systems utilize SSDs as the primary data storage. They employ a proximity graph, which connects similar vectors to form a graph and is the state-of-the-art index for vector search. However, these systems are hindered by sub-optimal data layouts that fail to effectively utilize valuable memory space to reduce disk access and suffer from poor locality for accessing disk-resident data. Through extensive profiling and analysis, we found that the structure of the proximity graph index is accessed more frequently than the vectors themselves, yet existing systems do not distinguish between the two.

Method: design the Gorgeous system with the principle of prioritizing graph structure over vectors. Specifically, Gorgeous features a memory cache that keeps the adjacency lists of graph nodes to improve cache hits and a disk block format that explicitly stores neighbors' adjacency lists along with a vector to enhance data locality.

Result: Gorgeous consistently outperforms two state-of-the-art disk-based systems for vector search, boosting average query throughput by over 60% and reducing query latency by over 35%.

Conclusion: Gorgeous consistently outperforms two state-of-the-art disk-based systems for vector search, boosting average query throughput by over 60% and reducing query latency by over 35%.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: GoVector是一种I/O高效的缓存策略，专为基于磁盘的图索引设计，可显著提高查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图的高维向量索引已成为大规模近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）的主流解决方案。然而，它们的大量内存占用通常需要在辅助设备上存储，频繁按需加载图和向量数据导致I/O成为主要的瓶颈，占查询延迟的90％以上。现有的静态缓存策略仅通过预加载入口点和多跳邻居来缓解初始导航阶段的问题，但它们在第二阶段（必须动态访问依赖于查询的节点以实现高召回率）中失败。

Method: GoVector结合了静态缓存（存储入口点和频繁访问的邻居）和动态缓存（自适应捕获具有高空间局部性的节点），并重新排序磁盘上的节点。

Result: 在90%的召回率下，GoVector平均减少了46%的I/O操作，查询吞吐量提高了1.73倍，查询延迟降低了42%。

Conclusion: GoVector通过结合静态缓存和动态缓存，并重新排列磁盘上的节点，显著提高了查询性能，并降低了I/O开销。

Abstract: Graph-based high-dimensional vector indices have become a mainstream solution
for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). However, their
substantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where
frequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the
dominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\% of query latency. Existing static
caching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by
preloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second
phase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high
recall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for
disk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores
entry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that
adaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search
phase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,
GoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the
same or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves
substantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations
by 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query
latency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.

Motivation: 针对小众和动态社区的推荐系统面临来自数据稀疏、冷启动用户和物品以及隐私约束的持续挑战。传统的协同过滤和基于内容的方法在这些设置中表现不佳，要么需要侵入性的用户数据，要么在没有偏好历史时失败。

Method: 提出DeepNaniNet，一个基于归纳图的深度神经推荐框架，结合用户-物品交互、物品-物品关系和来自BERT的丰富文本评论嵌入。

Result: DeepNaniNet在CiteULike基准测试中取得了最先进的冷启动结果，在用户召回率方面与DropoutNet相匹配，而不会降低矩阵外用户的性能，并且在AnimeULike的warm start中，Recall@100分别比加权矩阵分解（WMF）和DropoutNet高出7倍和1.5倍。

Conclusion: DeepNaniNet在数据稀疏和冷启动环境中提供高质量、保护隐私的推荐，同时有效整合异构内容源。

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural
recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive
graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations,
and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"
user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen
users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted
Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x
and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet
delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold
start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content
sources.

Motivation: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition.

Method: a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks

Result: achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an F-1 Score of 0.8786 in an ideal environment and achieving an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to 0.7866 in a noisy environment

Conclusion: This research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous

Conclusion: 该方法缩小甚至消除了生成模型和现代ID模型之间的性能差距，同时保留了生成模型的优势。

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true preferences and eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical.

Method: a generalized utility-based framework that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. A novel utility-based active sampling strategy for preference elicitation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm for personalized ranking.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm for personalized ranking.

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

Motivation: 传统的依赖于单模态特征或将多模态特征视为补充的方法难以将用户的动态偏好与作者的多模态属性对齐，从而限制了准确性和可解释性。

Method: MSPA（多模态自校正偏好对齐），一个个性化的作者推荐框架，包含两个组成部分：(1) 多模态偏好组合器，它使用MLLM从用户的打赏历史中生成结构化的偏好文本和嵌入；(2) 自校正偏好对齐推荐器，它将这些偏好与作者的多模态特征对齐，以提高准确性和可解释性。

Result: MSPA在准确率、召回率和文本质量方面都显著提高。

Conclusion: MSPA显著提高了动态直播场景中的准确率、召回率和文本质量，优于基线。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of live streaming platforms, personalized
recommendation systems have become pivotal in improving user experience and
driving platform revenue. The dynamic and multimodal nature of live streaming
content (e.g., visual, audio, textual data) requires joint modeling of user
behavior and multimodal features to capture evolving author characteristics.
However, traditional methods relying on single-modal features or treating
multimodal ones as supplementary struggle to align users' dynamic preferences
with authors' multimodal attributes, limiting accuracy and interpretability. To
address this, we propose MSPA (Multimodal Self-Corrective Preference
Alignment), a personalized author recommendation framework with two components:
(1) a Multimodal Preference Composer that uses MLLMs to generate structured
preference text and embeddings from users' tipping history; and (2) a
Self-Corrective Preference Alignment Recommender that aligns these preferences
with authors' multimodal features to improve accuracy and interpretability.
Extensive experiments and visualizations show that MSPA significantly improves
accuracy, recall, and text quality, outperforming baselines in dynamic live
streaming scenarios.

TL;DR: CAU是一种用于session-based recommendation的课程近似遗忘框架，它通过多目标优化和课程学习来解决现有方法的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在session-based recommendation中应用梯度上升进行近似遗忘时，存在两个挑战：直接应用梯度上升可能导致推荐性能下降；同时处理多个遗忘请求时，忽略样本顺序会导致次优性能和遗忘效果。

Method: CAU框架，包含基于梯度上升的遗忘项、保留性能的保留项，以及课程学习序列。

Result: 提出了两种度量遗忘难度的指标（梯度遗忘难度和嵌入遗忘难度），并设计了两种采样策略（硬采样和软采样）。

Conclusion: CAU通过多目标优化和课程学习策略，在session-based recommendation中实现了有效的近似遗忘，同时尽量减少了对推荐性能的负面影响。

Abstract: Approximate unlearning for session-based recommendation refers to eliminating
the influence of specific training samples from the recommender without
retraining of (sub-)models. Gradient ascent (GA) is a representative method to
conduct approximate unlearning. However, there still exist dual challenges to
apply GA for session-based recommendation. On the one hand, naive applying of
GA could lead to degradation of recommendation performance. On the other hand,
existing studies fail to consider the ordering of unlearning samples when
simultaneously processing multiple unlearning requests, leading to sub-optimal
recommendation performance and unlearning effect. To address the above
challenges, we introduce CAU, a curriculum approximate unlearning framework
tailored to session-based recommendation. CAU handles the unlearning task with
a GA term on unlearning samples. Specifically, to address the first challenge,
CAU formulates the overall optimization task as a multi-objective optimization
problem, where the GA term for unlearning samples is combined with retaining
terms for preserving performance. The multi-objective optimization problem is
solved through seeking the Pareto-Optimal solution, which achieves effective
unlearning with trivial sacrifice on recommendation performance. To tackle the
second challenge, CAU adopts a curriculum-based sequence to conduct unlearning
on batches of unlearning samples. The key motivation is to perform unlearning
from easy samples to harder ones. To this end, CAU first introduces two metrics
to measure the unlearning difficulty, including gradient unlearning difficulty
and embedding unlearning difficulty. Then, two strategies, hard-sampling and
soft-sampling, are proposed to select unlearning samples according to
difficulty scores.

TL;DR: MMQ：一种用于推荐系统的多模态混合量化框架，可有效统一多模态协同、特异性和行为适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的推荐系统使用独特的标识符 (ItemIDs) 来表示项目，但这种方法难以处理大型、动态的项目语料库和稀疏的长尾数据，从而限制了可扩展性和泛化。语义 ID 从文本和图像等多模态内容中派生，通过将项目映射到共享语义空间，提供了一种有希望的替代方案，从而实现知识转移并改进对新项目或稀有项目的推荐。然而，现有方法面临两个关键挑战：(1) 平衡跨模态协同与模态特定独特性，以及 (2) 弥合语义-行为差距，其中语义表示可能与实际用户偏好不一致。

Method: 我们提出了多模态混合量化 (MMQ)，这是一个训练新型多模态分词器的两阶段框架。首先，共享-特定分词器利用具有模态特定和模态共享专家的多专家架构，使用正交正则化来捕获全面的多模态信息。其次，行为感知微调动态地调整语义 ID 以适应下游推荐目标，同时通过多模态重建损失保留模态信息。

Result: 大量的离线实验和在线 A/B 测试表明 MMQ 的有效性。

Conclusion: MMQ有效地统一了多模态协同、特异性和行为适应，为生成式检索和判别式排序任务提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

Conclusion: FSAP生成的对抗性文档始终优于可信的、事实准确的文档。这些对抗性输出表现出强大的立场一致性和低可检测性，对神经检索系统构成了现实和可扩展的威胁。FSAP还可以有效地推广到专有和开源的LLM。

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: MLLMRec achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 38.53% over the best baselines.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation typically combines the user behavioral data with
the modal features of items to reveal user's preference, presenting superior
performance compared to the conventional recommendations. However, existing
methods still suffer from two key problems: (1) the initialization methods of
user multimodal representations are either behavior-unperceived or
noise-contaminated, and (2) the KNN-based item-item graph contains noisy edges
with low similarities and lacks audience co-occurrence relationships. To
address such issues, we propose MLLMRec, a novel MLLM-driven multimodal
recommendation framework with two item-item graph refinement strategies. On the
one hand, the item images are first converted into high-quality semantic
descriptions using an MLLM, which are then fused with the textual metadata of
items. Then, we construct a behavioral description list for each user and feed
it into the MLLM to reason about the purified user preference containing
interaction motivations. On the other hand, we design the threshold-controlled
denoising and topology-aware enhancement strategies to refine the suboptimal
item-item graph, thereby enhancing the item representation learning. Extensive
experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that MLLMRec
achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 38.53%
over the best baselines.

Motivation: 传统方法常常受到信息交互不足的困扰，最近的生成推荐模型通过直接生成项目预测来部分解决这个问题。为了更好地捕捉用户意图，最近的研究将推理过程引入到生成推荐中，显著提高了推荐性能。然而，这些方法受到项目语义表示的奇异性的限制，面临着推理路径多样性有限和推理过程可靠性不足等挑战。

Method: REG4Rec利用基于MoE的并行量化密码本(MPQ)为每个项目生成多个无序语义token，从而构建更大规模的多样化推理空间。此外，为了提高推理的可靠性，我们提出了一个训练推理增强阶段，包括用于推理的偏好对齐(PARS)和多步奖励增强(MSRA)策略。在推理过程中，提出了面向一致性的自反思修剪(CORP)，以丢弃不一致的推理路径，防止错误推理的传播。

Result: REG4Rec提供了出色的性能和巨大的实用价值。

Conclusion: REG4Rec在真实世界数据集和在线评估中表现出色，具有显著的实际价值。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next action in large-scale
recommender systems. While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient
information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially
address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture
user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into
generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance.
However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic
representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning
pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these
issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that
constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a
self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations.
Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook
(MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby
constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance
the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement
stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a
Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions
tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA
introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During
inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed
to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of
erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy
for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online
evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial
practical value.

Conclusion: DiffuMIN在离线和在线A/B测试中均表现出色，表明其优越性。

Abstract: CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction, crucial for recommender systems and
online advertising, etc., has been confirmed to benefit from modeling long-term
user behaviors. Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of
noise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness.
Recent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models.
However, current two-stage models often filter out significant information,
resulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the
complete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and
generative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest
Network) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user
interest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest
extraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain
interest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between
interest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user
interests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and
interest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented
interest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with
the latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted
interest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the
generated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive
offline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial
dataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN.
Moreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B
testing. Our source code is available at

Abstract: CTR models play a vital role in improving user experience and boosting
business revenue in many online personalized services. However, current CTR
models generally encounter bottlenecks in performance improvement. Inspired by
the scaling law phenomenon of LLMs, we propose a new paradigm for improving CTR
predictions: first, constructing a CTR model with accuracy scalable to the
model grade and data size, and then distilling the knowledge implied in this
model into its lightweight model that can serve online users. To put it into
practice, we construct a CTR model named SUAN (Stacked Unified Attention
Network). In SUAN, we propose the UAB as a behavior sequence encoder. A single
UAB unifies the modeling of the sequential and non-sequential features and also
measures the importance of each user behavior feature from multiple
perspectives. Stacked UABs elevate the configuration to a high grade, paving
the way for performance improvement. In order to benefit from the high
performance of the high-grade SUAN and avoid the disadvantage of its long
inference time, we modify the SUAN with sparse self-attention and parallel
inference strategies to form LightSUAN, and then adopt online distillation to
train the low-grade LightSUAN, taking a high-grade SUAN as a teacher. The
distilled LightSUAN has superior performance but the same inference time as the
LightSUAN, making it well-suited for online deployment. Experimental results
show that SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning
three orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled
LightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher. More
importantly, the distilled LightSUAN has been integrated into an online

TL;DR: TrackRec is a framework designed to enhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs for RS by accurately inferring recommendation CoT (RecCoT) for user preference using the knowledge from LLMs. It consists of a RecCoT generator and a RecCoT validator with an alternating feedback learning mechanism.

Conclusion: TrackRec continuously improves the user preference analysis capability of G and the validation capacity of V. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, TrackRec has been deployed on a lagre advertising platform with hundreds of millions of users, achieving substantial gains.

Abstract: The extensive world knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recommendation
systems (RS). Specifically, The chain of thought (CoT) has been shown to
improve the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks for RS. However, due
to the fact that LLMs often suffer from hallucination issues, there is no
guarantee that their reasoning CoT is effective. A key challenge is to further
enhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs through effective CoT
reasonings. Therefore, we propose \textbf{TrackRec}, a framework designed to
enhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs for RS. TrackRec specifically focuses on
accurately inferring recommendation CoT \textbf{(RecCoT)} for user preference
using the knowledge from LLMs. This RecCoT can serve both as an explanation for
the LLM's completion of recommendation tasks and as auxiliary features to
assist recommendation models in accomplishing recommendation tasks. TrackRec
consists of a RecCoT generator $(G)$ and a RecCoT validator $(V)$. Furthermore,
we design alternating feedback learning mechanism that $G$ undergoes direct
preference optimization via feedback from $V$ to produce increasingly accurate
RecCoT aligned with $V$'s standards. Meanwhile, $V$ is fine-tuned using the
inference feedback from $G$ to enhance its validation capabilities in alignment
with recommendation tasks. Through iterative alternating feedback learning
between $G$ and $V$, TrackRec continuously improves the user preference
analysis capability of $G$ and the validation capacity of $V$. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it
surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, TrackRec has been deployed on a
lagre advertising platform with hundreds of millions of users, achieving
substantial gains.

Motivation: 检索增强生成（RAG）已成为知识密集型NLP任务的标准框架，但大多数RAG管道仍然将检索和推理视为孤立的组件，限制了复杂任务的性能。

Method: 本文对集成了反馈的先进检索和排序机制进行了结构化概述，并根据反馈信号的来源和作用对其进行分类，以改进查询、检索到的上下文或文档池。

Result: 本文对检索增强生成（RAG）中的反馈机制进行了分类和总结。

Conclusion: 本文综述了先进的检索和排序机制，这些机制集成了反馈，旨在弥合信息检索（IR）和自然语言处理（NLP）的视角，并将检索视为端到端RAG系统的动态、可学习的组成部分。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the robustness of MEL models under adversarial attacks, finds they are vulnerable, and proposes LLM-RetLink to improve their resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies have not systematically investigated the impact of visual adversarial attacks on MEL models.

Method: The paper proposes LLM-RetLink, a two-stage process involving extracting initial entity descriptions using large vision models (LVMs) and then dynamically generating candidate descriptive sentences via web-based retrieval.

Result: Experimental results show that current MEL models generally lack sufficient robustness against visual perturbations. LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by 0.4%-35.7%.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the lack of robustness of current MEL models against visual perturbations and proposes LLM-RetLink to improve the model's anti-interference ability. The proposed model improves the accuracy of MEL and shows significant advantages under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: The explosive growth of multimodal data has driven the rapid development of
multimodal entity linking (MEL) models. However, existing studies have not
systematically investigated the impact of visual adversarial attacks on MEL
models. We conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of
mainstream MEL models under different adversarial attack scenarios, covering
two core tasks: Image-to-Text (I2T) and Image+Text-to-Text (IT2T). Experimental
results show that current MEL models generally lack sufficient robustness
against visual perturbations. Interestingly, contextual semantic information in
input can partially mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations. Based on
this insight, we propose an LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking
(LLM-RetLink), which significantly improves the model's anti-interference
ability through a two-stage process: first, extracting initial entity
descriptions using large vision models (LVMs), and then dynamically generating
candidate descriptive sentences via web-based retrieval. Experiments on five
datasets demonstrate that LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by
0.4%-35.7%, especially showing significant advantages under adversarial
conditions. This research highlights a previously unexplored facet of MEL
robustness, constructs and releases the first MEL adversarial example dataset,
and sets the stage for future work aimed at strengthening the resilience of
multimodal systems in adversarial environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems can reinforce existing biases, leading to unfair exposure and reduced diversity.

Method: a multi-stage bias evaluation framework using the Book-Crossing dataset

Result: thematic bias originates from content imbalances and is amplified by user engagement patterns. Users with niche interests receive less personalised recommendations, whereas users with diverse interests receive more consistent recommendations.

Conclusion: Recommender systems should be carefully designed to accommodate a broader range of user interests, and this work lays the groundwork for extending thematic bias analysis to other domains.

Abstract: Recommender systems help users discover new content, but can also reinforce
existing biases, leading to unfair exposure and reduced diversity. This paper
introduces and investigates thematic bias in book recommendations, defined as a
disproportionate favouring or neglect of certain book themes. We adopt a
multi-stage bias evaluation framework using the Book-Crossing dataset to
evaluate thematic bias in recommendations and its impact on different user
groups.
  Our findings show that thematic bias originates from content imbalances and
is amplified by user engagement patterns. By segmenting users based on their
thematic preferences, we find that users with niche and long-tail interests
receive less personalised recommendations, whereas users with diverse interests
receive more consistent recommendations. These findings suggest that
recommender systems should be carefully designed to accommodate a broader range
of user interests. By contributing to the broader goal of responsible AI, this
work also lays the groundwork for extending thematic bias analysis to other
domains.

Motivation: 自动驾驶汽车在减少交通事故死亡和提高交通效率方面具有广阔前景，但其广泛应用取决于将稳健的伦理推理嵌入到日常和紧急操作中。

Method: 分层安全强化学习 (Safe RL) 框架，该框架将道德考量与标准驾驶目标明确结合。

Result: 该方法在降低伦理风险和保持驾驶性能方面优于基线方法。这是首次通过实际场景中的安全强化学习对自动驾驶汽车的伦理决策进行研究。

Conclusion: 结合形式控制理论和数据驱动学习，以在复杂的人机混合交通环境中推进符合伦理的自主性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

Motivation: 由于患者群体和临床环境的巨大差异，准确的肺癌风险预测仍然具有挑战性——没有一个单一模型对所有队列都表现最佳。

Method: 结合队列特定知识与现代检索和推理技术，为每个患者动态选择最合适的模型。

Result: 该智能体通过结合基于FAISS的相似性搜索和大型语言模型（LLM）的提示，实现了动态的、队列感知的风险预测，并根据每个患者的 profile 进行了个性化。

Conclusion: 该智能体支持跨不同临床人群的灵活的、由队列驱动的模型选择，为现实世界肺癌筛查中的个体化风险评估提供了一条实用途径。

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HHNAS-AM, a hierarchical hybrid neural architecture search method with adaptive mutation policies, to efficiently explore diverse architectural configurations for text classification, achieving significant accuracy improvements on the Spider dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NAS models for text classification lack a hybrid hierarchical structure and have no restriction on the architecture structure, leading to a large and redundant search space that existing RL models cannot navigate effectively.

Method: The paper proposes HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive Mutation Policies), which employs mutation strategies that dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using Q-learning.

Result: The HHNAS-AM model achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines on the Spider dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed HHNAS-AM model consistently discovers high-performing architectures and achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy on the Spider dataset.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

TL;DR: LPO是一种新的偏好对齐框架，它通过梯度解耦、偏移约束和可控的拒绝抑制来解决DPO的过度拟合和崩溃问题。


<details>

Motivation: DPO（直接偏好优化）由于其简单性和训练稳定性而成为一种广泛使用的离线偏好优化算法。但是，DPO容易过度拟合和崩溃。为了应对这些挑战

Method: 我们提出了线性偏好优化（LPO），这是一种新颖的对齐框架，具有三个关键创新。首先，我们通过用绝对差分损失代替log-sigmoid函数来引入梯度解耦，从而隔离了优化动态。其次，我们通过偏移约束结合正则化项来提高稳定性，以保持所选响应质量。第三，我们使用梯度分离和直接估计以及线性调节拒绝概率下降的可调系数来实现可控的拒绝抑制。

Result: LPO在各种任务中持续提高了性能，包括通用文本任务、数学任务和文本到语音（TTS）任务。

Conclusion: LPO在各种任务中持续提高了性能，包括通用文本任务、数学任务和文本到语音（TTS）任务。这些结果证明LPO是偏好对齐的稳健且可调的范例。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告依赖于精确的推荐模型，最近的进展使用预训练的大规模基础模型（LFMs）来捕获用户在多个场景和任务中的一般兴趣。然而，现有方法存在关键限制：它们仅提取和转移用户表示（URs），忽略了有价值的项目表示（IRs）和用户-项目交叉表示（CRs）；并且它们仅将UR用作下游应用程序中的特征，这未能弥合上游-下游差距并忽略了更多的转移粒度。

Method: 提出了LFM4Ads，这是一个用于广告推荐的全表示多粒度转移框架。它首先全面转移用户表示（URs），项目表示（IRs）和用户-项目交叉表示（CRs），即预训练基础模型中所有可用的表示。为了有效利用CRs，它识别最佳提取层并将它们聚合为可转移的粗粒度形式。此外，我们通过多粒度机制增强了可转移性：用于特征级转移的非线性适配器，用于模块级转移的同构交互模块以及用于模型级转移的独立检索。

Result: 自2024年第四季度投入生产部署以来，LFM4Ads已在各种广告场景中实现了超过10次的成功生产发布，包括诸如微信朋友圈和频道等主要场景。这些发布在整个平台上实现了2.45%的整体GMV提升，转化为估计每年数亿美元的收入增长。

Conclusion: LFM4Ads在腾讯的工业级广告平台上成功部署，并在各种广告场景中实现了超过10次的成功发布。这些发布在整个平台上实现了2.45%的GMV提升，转化为估计每年数亿美元的收入增长。

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Motivation: 来自多普勒激光雷达、雷达和辐射仪等遥感仪器的精确大气剖面经常被低信噪比门、距离折叠和虚假不连续性破坏。传统的间隙填充会模糊精细结构，而深度模型缺乏置信度估计。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的基于深度学习的工作流程，可以实现高保真重建，从而增强对流诊断，支持实时数据同化，并改进长期气候再分析。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

TL;DR: 使用深度平衡层，本文缩小了NOs理论和实践之间的差距，证明了GEO可以有效解决凸优化问题，并在多个应用中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理论和实践之间存在显著差距：通用逼近定理的最坏情况参数界限表明，NO可能需要不切实际的大量参数来解决大多数算子学习问题，这与大量实验证据直接矛盾。

Method: 使用有限维深度平衡层

Result: 当输入损失位于合适的无限维紧集中时，GEO可以一致地逼近相应解，且rank, depth, 和width 仅以逼近误差倒数的对数形式增长。在三个应用中验证了理论结果和GEO的可训练性：(1)非线性PDE，(2)随机最优控制问题，(3)流动性约束下金融数学中的对冲问题。

Conclusion: GEO可以一致地逼近相应解，且rank, depth, 和width 仅以逼近误差倒数的对数形式增长。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的系统，该系统结合了静态编译器分析和蒙特卡洛树搜索，以解决在分布式加速器系统上划分大型机器学习模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式加速器系统上划分大型机器学习模型是一个复杂的过程，需要一系列相互依赖的决策，这些决策因内部分片歧义而进一步复杂化。因此，现有的自动分区器经常出现内存不足错误，或者在探索可能分区的指数级大空间时速度慢得令人望而却步。为了缓解这种情况，他们人为地限制了搜索空间，但这种方法经常产生违反设备内存约束或导致次优性能的不可行解决方案。

Method: 该系统结合了一种新颖的静态编译器分析与蒙特卡洛树搜索。该分析通过识别 (i) 需要相同分片的张量维度，以及 (ii) 需要解决的分区“冲突”来构建高效的决策空间。

Result: 该系统在各种硬件平台和模型架构上显着优于最先进的工业方法。

Conclusion: 该系统优于最先进的工业方法，能够发现以前未知的更优解决方案，并且即使对于复杂的大型模型，该过程也是完全自动化的。

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络已通过利用分子图中编码的丰富结构信息，在预测分子特性方面取得了显着成功。然而，它们的黑盒性质降低了解释性，这限制了对药物发现和材料设计等重要应用中预测的信任。此外，由于纠缠的消息传递动力学，现有的解释技术通常无法可靠地量化单个原子或子结构的贡献。

Method: SEAL（通过归因学习的子结构解释），一种新的可解释图神经网络，可将模型预测归因于有意义的分子子图。SEAL将输入图分解为化学相关的片段，并估计它们对输出的因果影响。片段贡献和模型预测之间的强对齐是通过显式减少我们提出的模型架构中的片段间消息传递来实现的。

Result: 在合成基准和真实分子数据集上的大量评估表明，SEAL在定量归因指标和人工对齐的可解释性方面优于其他可解释性方法。用户研究进一步证实，SEAL为领域专家提供了更直观和值得信赖的解释。

Conclusion: SEAL在定量归因指标和人工对齐的可解释性方面优于其他可解释性方法，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了一个有希望的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes, where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes.

Method: a resampling-based training procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing regularization that favors flatter solutions.

Result: improve calibration and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps

Conclusion: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot) improves calibration and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Conclusion: 联邦学习持续提高任何单个客户端的收敛性，因为参与的客户端数量增加。

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing computational costs of training deep neural networks, and the limitations of traditional layer-freezing methods.

Method: It proposes similarity-aware channel augmentation and a progressive compression strategy.

Result: The solution achieves significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with a minor time overhead.

Conclusion: This paper provides a systematic solution to challenges in caching feature maps for layer-freezing, achieving significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

TL;DR: Studies robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates, providing minimax rates for mean estimation and linear regression, suggesting that samples beyond a corruption threshold may be discarded.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring structural heterogeneity in settings like distributed and federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks where samples may be independently corrupted with known but non-identical probabilities.

Method: Provides tight minimax rates for mean estimation of multivariate bounded distributions and univariate Gaussian distributions, and establishes minimax rate for squared error (up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$) for multivariate Gaussian mean estimation and linear regression.

Result: Gives tight minimax rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns in mean estimation for multivariate bounded distributions and univariate gaussian distributions. Establishes the minimax rate for squared error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$ for multivariate gaussian mean estimation and linear regression.

Conclusion: Optimal estimators may discard samples beyond a certain corruption threshold, determined by the empirical distribution of corruption rates.

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

Motivation: 传统的CVR预测方法将模型训练限制为来自单一生产关键归因机制的标签，丢弃了替代归因视角中的补充信号。

Conclusion: MAL在离线指标上实现了+0.51% GAUC的提升，在线实验表明，MAL实现了+2.6%的ROI增长。

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Motivation: 现代优化算法的有效性通常对超参数的选择非常敏感，特别是步长。调整这些参数通常很困难，资源密集且耗时。因此，最近的努力 направлены на 提高优化器在各种超参数选择中的稳定性。

Method: 提出了一种NGN步长方法的新颖改编，即动量版本（NGN-M）。

Result: 实验证明，NGN步长与动量的结合，增强了对步长超参数选择的鲁棒性，同时提供了与其它state-of-the-art优化器相当或超过的性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一种动量版本的NGN算法（NGN-M），在不那么严格的假设下，达到了标准的收敛速度，并且不需要插值条件或有界随机梯度或迭代的假设。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Result: 发现DNNs在过度参数化状态下会发生输出特征空间的坍缩。虽然这种坍缩提高了网络的泛化能力，但添加更多的层最终会导致退化状态，模型通过将不同的输入映射到相同的输出来学习trivial解，从而导致零损失。新提出的“虫洞”解决方案可以绕过这种退化。

Conclusion: DNNs在过度参数化状态下会坍缩输出特征空间，虽然这提高了泛化能力，但添加更多层会导致模型学习到trivial解，将不同的输入映射到相同的输出，从而导致零损失。可以使用新提出的“虫洞”解决方案绕过这种退化。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Motivation: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed to mitigate this issue.

Method: Introducing a fine-grained concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance to evaluate monosemanticity. Using Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks.

Result: SAEs reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. Greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often impairs downstream performance. SAEs enable more precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Conclusion: SAEs reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability, enabling more precise concept-level control, especially with the proposed APP intervention method.

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Method: Hydra 整合了 Mamba 风格的结构化状态空间模型 (SSM) 主干，具有间歇性稀疏全局注意力、块级 MoE 前馈路由和双重（工作区加事实 PKM）记忆。

Result: 我们形式化了组件接口，给出了透明的参数和复杂性计算，并概述了一个旨在稳定激活各个部分的阶段性课程。我们用说明性的玩具规模原型测量（在合成数据上数千万个参数）来配合规范，其唯一目的是证明实现的可行性和定性的缩放行为（例如，长上下文吞吐量交叉和可控的专家路由），而不是声称具有竞争力的完整规模性能。

Conclusion: Hydra 通过结合 SSM 效率、选择性稀疏注意力、MoE 容量和可学习记忆，勾勒出通往模块化、输入自适应长上下文语言模型的路径；在目标规模上验证最终任务收益仍然是未来的工作。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习变得越来越普遍，并且数据隐私法规不断发展，从训练模型中删除私有或受版权保护信息的能力正成为一项日益关键的要求。现有的遗忘方法通常依赖于在遗忘过程中访问整个训练数据集的假设。然而，在原始训练数据可能无法访问的实际场景中，这种假设可能不成立，即无源设置。

Method: 提出了一种估计未知剩余训练数据 Hessian 的方法，这是高效遗忘所需的一个关键组成部分。

Result: 在各种数据集上进行的大量实验验证了我们方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保持剩余数据性能的同时，实现高效的零样本遗忘，并为遗忘性能提供可靠的理论保证。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize RL using category theory and universal coalgebras.

Method: Introduces a categorial generalization of RL, termed universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on mathematical abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous parallel distributed computation.

Result: The space of algorithms for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain category forms a topos.

Conclusion: URL generalizes the problem of finding fixed points in RL to determining the final coalgebra asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Result: Varied results, with some methods standing up to scrutiny and others faltering when tested outside their initial experimental conditions.

Conclusion: The paper conducts a reproducibility and replicability (R+R) experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques, revealing that some methods hold up while others falter under different experimental conditions.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeLLM是一种基于unlearning的防御框架，它可以从LLM中消除有害知识，同时保持语言流畅性和通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak攻击通过设计对抗性prompt绕过对齐机制，导致模型生成有害、受限或有偏见的内容，对大型语言模型 (LLM) 的安全构成严重威胁。

Method: SafeLLM采用三阶段流程：(1) 使用混合方法进行动态不安全输出检测，该方法将外部分类器与模型内部评估相结合；(2) 通过前馈网络 (FFN) 激活进行token级有害内容追踪，以定位有害知识；(3) 约束优化以抑制不安全行为，同时不降低整体模型质量。

Result: 在多个jailbreak基准测试中，对 prominent LLM (Vicuna、LLaMA 和 GPT-J) 进行的广泛实验表明，SafeLLM 在保持高通用性能的同时，显著降低了攻击成功率。与监督微调和直接偏好优化等标准防御方法相比，SafeLLM 提供了更强的安全保证，对有害行为的更精确控制，以及对未知攻击的更强鲁棒性。此外，SafeLLM 在有害知识被遗忘后，仍能保持通用性能。

Conclusion: SafeLLM通过不可逆地消除负责有害生成途径的FFN子结构，实现了有针对性的、不可逆的遗忘。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

TL;DR: FairPrep是一个评估公平性预处理技术的基准测试框架，它填补了公平性基准测试领域的空白，并为推进数据级公平性研究奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统越来越多地集成到高风险决策过程中，确保算法结果的公平性已成为一个关键问题。减轻偏差的方法通常分为三类：预处理、处理中和后处理。虽然后两者受到了极大的关注，但预处理方法在数据层面运作，并具有模型不可知论和改进的隐私合规性等优势，但受到的关注相对较少，并且缺乏标准化评估工具。

Method: 我们介绍了FairPrep，这是一个可扩展的模块化基准测试框架，旨在评估表格数据集上的公平性预处理技术。FairPrep构建于AIF360平台之上，允许无缝集成数据集、公平性干预措施和预测模型。它具有批量处理界面，可以实现高效的实验和公平性以及效用指标的自动报告。

Result: FairPrep提供标准化管道并支持可重复的评估

Conclusion: FairPrep填补了公平性基准测试领域的关键空白，并为推进数据级公平性研究提供了实践基础。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs algorithm significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex multi-scale problems. The effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm are validated through extensive numerical experiments.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Method: 该研究提出了一种名为SleepDIFFormer的多元差分Transformer模型，用于联合学习脑电图（EEG）和眼动图（EOG）的表征。

Result: 该方法在五个不同的睡眠分期数据集上取得了state-of-the-art的性能。通过特征分布对齐，减轻了空间和时间注意力噪声，从而能够推广到未见过的目标数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究发现对睡眠脑电图特征进行差分注意力分析，可以有效提升睡眠阶段分类的准确率，并有助于睡眠质量评估。

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

TL;DR: This paper introduces a more scalable framework for synthesizing interpretations of black-box models with local optimality guarantees, balancing accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models involves balancing accuracy and explainability. Existing techniques lack formal guarantees on Pareto-optimality or have scalability limitations.

Method: A framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more scalable synthesis of interpretations.  It verifies local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem, which is solved using a SAT solver. It begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability.

Result: The approach demonstrates efficacy on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the Pareto-optimal front of interpretations.

Conclusion: The approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods offering global guarantees.

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a poly-window contrastive learning framework for ECG analysis that outperforms conventional methods with fewer pre-training epochs and reduced computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis are often constrained by limited access to annotated data. Most existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods generate only pairwise augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG recordings.

Method: poly-window contrastive learning framework. It extracts multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired by the principle of slow feature analysis, this approach explicitly encourages the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features that persist across time.

Result: Poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock pre-training time reduction.

Conclusion: Poly-window contrastive learning is a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis and provides a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

TL;DR: CSG在知识图谱链接预测中效果不好，其他指标可能更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解数据集复杂性是评估和比较知识图谱（KG）上的链接预测模型的根本。CSG度量作为一种与分类器无关的复杂性度量，据称可随类基数缩放并与下游性能相关，但到目前为止，尚未在KG设置中对其进行评估。

Method: 通过transformer获得的嵌入，在多关系链接预测的背景下，批判性地检验CSG，并引入和基准测试了一组结构和语义KG复杂性指标。

Result: CSG对参数化高度敏感，并且不能随着类的数量稳健地缩放。此外，它与标准性能指标（如平均倒数排名（MRR）和Hit@1）的相关性较弱或不一致。关系熵、节点级最大关系多样性和关系类型基数与MRR和Hit@1呈强烈的负相关，表明这些是任务难度的更可靠指标。相反，图连通性度量（如平均度数、度数熵、PageRank和特征向量中心性）与Hit@10呈正相关。

Conclusion: CSG在知识图谱链接预测中表现不佳，需要更稳定、可解释和任务对齐的复杂性度量。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the robustness of the ExBigBang model on a benchmark persona classification dataset. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of combining text and tabular data. Explainable AI techniques provide insights into the model's predictions.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

TL;DR: End-users can reduce unfairness in machine learning models by strategically relabeling their own data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data, leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Recognizing that many models rely on user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training process.

Method: We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets.

Result: Our findings show that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a small impact on the overall prediction error.

Conclusion: A subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a small impact on the overall prediction error.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

TL;DR: EvoFormer通过结构感知Transformer模块和进化敏感时间模块，克服了动态图嵌入中的结构访问偏差和突发进化盲区问题，并在多个任务上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临两个关键但未被充分探索的问题：结构访问偏差，其中随机游走抽样不成比例地强调高学位节点，导致冗余和噪声结构表示；以及突发进化盲区，由于刚性或过于简单的时间建模策略，未能有效检测到突然的结构变化，导致不一致的时间嵌入。

Method: EvoFormer，一个为动态图级表示学习量身定制的进化感知Transformer框架。

Result: EvoFormer在五个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EvoFormer在图相似度排序、时间异常检测和时间分割任务中实现了最先进的性能，验证了其在纠正结构和时间偏差方面的有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of large-scale benchmark datasets for heterogeneous text-attributed graphs hinders the development and fair comparison of representation learning methods.

Method: introduce CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph

Result: provides (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across diverse modeling paradigms.

Conclusion: This paper introduces CITE, the first and largest heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials, comprising over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, and establishes standardized evaluation procedures and conducts extensive benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a clustering method within Federated Learning that adapts dynamically and does not require pre-selection of the number of clusters.

Method: Evolving Fuzzy System within Federated Learning, implemented using PyTorch.

Result: The proposed method outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI datasets.

Conclusion: Evolving Fuzzy System within Federated Learning outperforms established classification methods on UCI datasets, but is computationally intensive.

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

*Jun Choi,Chang-Ock Lee,Minam Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to accelerate DeepONet training


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: accelerate DeepONet training. building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into two smaller, more manageable subproblems one for the branch network and one for the trunk network and solves them separately.

Method: an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method

Result: Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form.

Conclusion: The method is generalized to a broader type of  L^2  loss with a regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用可穿戴设备的人类活动识别（HAR）近年来已取得显著进展，但当模型部署到新用户时，其泛化能力仍然有限。这种性能下降主要是由于用户引起的。概念漂移（UICD），突显了个性化效率的重要性。

Method: 提出了一种混合框架，该框架首先在用户之间进行泛化，然后使用设备上的少样本学习快速适应个体用户。通过仅使用用户特定数据更新分类器层，我们的方法以最小的计算和内存开销实现了稳健的个性化。

Conclusion: 快速、轻量级和有效的个性化在嵌入式平台上是可行的，为在野外部署的可扩展和用户感知HAR系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild
