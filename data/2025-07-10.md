TL;DR: The Gemini 2.X model family, including 2.5 Pro and Flash, achieves state-of-the-art performance in coding and reasoning, with varying trade-offs between capability and cost, suitable for agentic problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: achieving SoTA performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks and unlock new agentic workflows

Method: introducing the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite models

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost

Conclusion: The Gemini 2.X model generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic problem solving.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and
Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite
models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA
performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its
incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that
excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours
of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and
reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini
2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute
and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high
performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model
generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing
users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic
problem solving.

### [2] [Humans overrely on overconfident language models, across languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06306)
*Neil Rathi,Dan Jurafsky,Kaitlyn Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型在全球环境中的安全性，发现用户过度依赖于自信的模型生成内容，并且这种依赖行为在不同语言之间存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在全球部署，因此校准它们在各种语言中的响应至关重要，以准确传达不确定性和局限性。先前的研究表明，LLM在英语中具有语言上的过度自信，导致用户过度依赖自信的生成内容。然而，认知标记（例如，“It's definitely”，“I think”）的使用和解释可能在不同语言之间存在很大差异。因此，本研究旨在评估LLM在全球环境中的安全性。

Method: 分析了LLM生成的认知标记的分布，并测量了不同语言的人类依赖率。

Result: LLM在跨语言上过度自信，但对已记录的语言变异也很敏感。例如，模型在日语中生成最多的不确定性标记，在德语和普通话中生成最多的确定性标记。用户在所有语言中都强烈依赖于自信的LLM生成内容，但依赖行为在跨语言上有所不同：例如，用户对日语中不确定性表达的依赖程度明显高于英语。

Conclusion: 跨语言地，用户过度依赖于自信的模型生成内容，这带来了高风险。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are
linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident
generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,
'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we
study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,
and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a
global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first
analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that
while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to
documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers
of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and
Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that
while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,
reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely
significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.
Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident
model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of
multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and
linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Extend at Test-Time (ETT) to extend the context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs with constant memory and linear computation overhead, achieving up to 30% accuracy improvement on LongBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences.

Method: Extend at Test-Time (ETT): efficiently fine-tuning the model's parameters on the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences.

Result: Extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32 times (increasing from 1k to 32k tokens) on LongBench results in up to a 30 percent improvement in the model's accuracy.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in the models' accuracy.

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase
quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses
challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we
introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the
context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory
requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the
context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on
the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT
on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32
times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent
improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in
LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study,
we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at
test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs
is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in
the models' accuracy.

Conclusion: 提出了一个通过 words-as-classifiers 统一语义的模型草图。

Abstract: Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each
have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of
language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models
of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal,
distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the
case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is
paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded
semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional
language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within
interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the
words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science,
and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics
unified through words-as-classifiers.

TL;DR: evaluate tokenizer quality by morphological alignment


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate tokenizer quality

Method: expand MorphScore to support a total of 70 languages and correlate alignment scores with downstream task performance for five pre-trained languages models on seven tasks

Result: morphological alignment does not explain very much variance in model performance

Conclusion: morphological alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to model performance

Abstract: While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model
training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate
tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to
which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token
boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore
(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a
total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in
evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We
then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five
pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of
the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not
explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological
alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to
model performance.

TL;DR: This paper shows how syntactic structures can be formulated using colored operads and hypermagmas, unifying various linguistic principles and movement rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma.

Method: the structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions, and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure of theta roles.

Result: the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad generators.

Conclusion: Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored operads and a transduction of colored operads.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERK 是一种可扩展的方法，用于学习使用梯度更新在测试时将长输入上下文编码到轻量级模型适配器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究表明，使用测试时学习将上下文直接编码到模型参数中可以有效地实现对噪声信息的推理。然而，用于启用测试时学习的元学习方法对内存的要求过高，阻止了它们在长文本环境中的应用。

Method: PERK 采用在元训练阶段的两个嵌套优化循环。内部循环将上下文快速编码到低秩适配器 (LoRA) 中，该适配器充当基本模型的参数高效内存模块。同时，外部循环学习使用更新后的适配器来准确地回忆和推理来自编码长文本上下文的相关信息。

Result: PERK 在多个长文本推理任务中显著优于标准的基于 prompt 的长文本基线，对于较小的模型 (GPT-2) 实现了高达 90% 的平均绝对性能提升，对于我们评估的最大的模型 Qwen-2.5-0.5B 实现了高达 27% 的提升。PERK 通常对推理复杂性、长度外推和上下文中相关信息的位置更具鲁棒性。虽然 PERK 在训练期间需要大量内存，但它在推理时比基于 prompt 的长文本推理更有效地扩展。

Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information
in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using
test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can
effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning
methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,
preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose
PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for
learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight
model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization
loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a
low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for
the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter
to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long
context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK
significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,
achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models
(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In
general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and
the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while
PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at
inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

*Pankayaraj Pathmanathan,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的奖励模型REFORM，通过自我改进来增强鲁棒性，并在实验中证明了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励建模（RM）被越来越多地用于模型微调、响应过滤和排序等任务中，以捕捉人类偏好来对齐大型语言模型（LLM）。然而，由于人类偏好的内在复杂性和可用数据集的有限覆盖，奖励模型经常在分布偏移或对抗性扰动下失败。现有的识别这种失败模式的方法通常依赖于关于偏好分布或失败属性的先验知识，限制了它们在无法获得此类信息的实际环境中的实用性。

Method: 提出了一种可处理的、偏好分布不可知的、通过奖励引导的控制解码来发现奖励模型失败模式的方法，并在此基础上引入了REFORM，这是一个自我改进的奖励建模框架，通过使用奖励模型本身来指导错误评分的响应生成，从而增强鲁棒性。这些对抗性示例然后用于扩充训练数据并修补奖励模型的错位行为。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的偏好数据集Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH)和PKU Beavertails上评估了REFORM，并证明了它在不牺牲奖励质量的情况下显著提高了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: REFORM显著提高了鲁棒性，同时没有牺牲奖励质量，在直接评估和下游策略训练中保持了性能，并通过消除虚假相关性进一步提高了对齐质量。

Abstract: Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large
language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model
finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent
complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,
reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial
perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically
rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,
limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is
unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution
agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided
controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving
reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model
itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial
examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward
model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference
datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate
that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.
Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in
downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing
spurious correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications of LLMs in clinical text generation face challenges due to unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered patient data, as well as long and semantically dense clinical notes.

Method: The study introduces CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a domain-specific framework that incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy and a task-specific dual-stage retrieval mechanism.

Result: CLI-RAG achieves an 87.7% alignment score, surpassing the 80.7% baseline from real clinician-authored notes, and demonstrates high consistency across LLMs.

Conclusion: The study shows that CLI-RAG preserves temporal and semantic alignment across visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7% baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also demonstrate high consistency across LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms,
have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However,
real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly
unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2)
clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting
infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting
clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a
domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text
generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy
that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific
dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types
using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content
within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual
hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset.
Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across
visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7%
baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also
demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior
essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

Method: 提出了一种集合式段落选择方法，并引入了 SETR，它通过 Chain-of-Thought 推理显式地识别查询的信息需求，并选择一个能够共同满足这些需求的最佳段落集合。

Result: 在多跳 RAG 基准测试中，SETR 在答案正确性和检索质量方面均优于专有的基于 LLM 的重排序器和开源基线。

Conclusion: SETR 在多跳 RAG 基准测试中，在答案正确性和检索质量方面均优于专有的基于 LLM 的重排序器和开源基线，为 RAG 系统中传统的重排序器提供了一种有效且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved
passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a
comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on
their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of
complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a
set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly
identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy
those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR
outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in
terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and
efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems. The code is

Conclusion: DETM 是一个可扩展且有效的工具，可用于分析全球政策讨论的演变。

Abstract: Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing
global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal
analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to
evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance
strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as
manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the
complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing
relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,
particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.
In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded
topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.
A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over
time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the
postponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals
shifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to
recent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,
finance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,
including preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word
distributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for
analyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the
implications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and
refinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.

Result: SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing energy consumption. Introduces Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset. Proposes two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD) and Precision at R (P@R).

Conclusion: SCoRE is an efficient, modular, and scalable RE system suitable for real-world applications, outperforming existing methods with lower energy consumption.

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging
external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE),
particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable
and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained
large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective
sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no
finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining
supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance
despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE
evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),
measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,
and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also
release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where
only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show
that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model
complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the
advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and
scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

TL;DR: They propose Perception-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO) to improve the perception of visual inputs and overall performance on multimodal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning has a major source of error in the perception of visual inputs. RLVR's design and optimizations remain tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when applied to multimodal reasoning tasks.

Method: They propose Perception-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal supervision signals. They introduce the Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO objective.

Result: PAPO yields significant overall improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. They also observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO.

Conclusion: This work introduces a deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages visually grounded reasoning. They also identify a unique loss hacking issue, which they rigorously analyze and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust
multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain
tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when
applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major
source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of
visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy
Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages
the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal
supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,
external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the
Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO
objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall
improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more
pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also
observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating
improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis
of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze
and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a
deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning

TL;DR: Time normalization is framed as code generation using SCATE and LLMs, enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones after data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time normalization systems have limited expressivity and struggle with complex temporal expressions.

Method: Formulation of time normalization as code generation with SCATE framework and LLM-based data augmentation.

Result: Small models achieve strong performance in time normalization, outperforming LLMs.

Conclusion: Small models trained on augmented data outperform LLMs in time normalization.

Abstract: Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal
expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream
applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical
decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit
expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional,
event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a
novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in
the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and
compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library
and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE
code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation
pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level
validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained
on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their
LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time
normalization.

Method: 系统地评估各种线性注意力模型在生成中的应用，包括向量递归到高级门控机制，无论是独立使用还是混合使用。训练并开源了72个模型：36个3.4亿参数和36个13亿参数，涵盖了六种线性注意力变体和五种混合比例。

Result: 优秀的独立线性模型不一定在混合模型中表现出色。虽然语言建模在从线性到完全注意力的比率中保持稳定，但召回率随着完全注意力层的增加而显着提高，尤其是在低于3：1的比率下。选择性门控、分层递归和受控遗忘对于有效的混合模型至关重要。

Conclusion: 结合线性注意力模型和完整注意力层的混合架构，为了达到Transformer级别的效率，推荐使用HGRN-2或GatedDeltaNet等架构，线性与完整比例在3:1和6:1之间。

Abstract: Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,
prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden
states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,
leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.
Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention
component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various
linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced
gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this
comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M
parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six
linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on
standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone
linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling
remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly
improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.
Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled
forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures
such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1
to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的水下图像增强方法，该方法利用 CLIP 模型来提高感知质量和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像的质量受到光吸收和散射的严重影响。现有的基于深度学习的水下图像增强 (UIE) 方法通常忽略考虑人类感知，并且在解决方案空间内缺乏足够的约束。

Method: 提出了一种具有对比语言-图像预训练 (CLIP) 感知损失模块和课程对比正则化的 UIE 方法。

Result: 通过利用 CLIP 模型的视觉语义特征提取能力，学习适当的提示对来映射和评估水下图像的质量，从而开发出更符合人类视觉感知的水下图像感知模型。该模型被整合到增强网络中作为感知损失模块，以提高增强图像的感知质量。此外，CLIP 感知模型与课程对比正则化相结合，以增强对 CLIP 感知空间内增强图像的约束，从而减轻欠增强和过增强的风险。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉质量和泛化能力方面优于当前最优方法。

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks
and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater
images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep
learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved
good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human
perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.
Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual
quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE
method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss
module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a
perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual
perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model
is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the
quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated
as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the
perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model
is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the
constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,
mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.
Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize
the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,
ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and
negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and
generalization ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARC: Sparse Autoencoders for Aligned Representation of Concepts, a new framework that learns a single, unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts, such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model interpretability.

Method: a new framework that learns a single, unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g., vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism, ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages semantic consistency between models.

Result: On Open Images, SPARC dramatically improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than tripling the alignment compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: SPARC creates a shared sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal retrieval.

*Rushil Desai,Frederik Warburg,Trevor Darrell,Marissa Ramirez de Chanlatte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesSDF 是一种用于量化神经隐式 SDF 模型中不确定性的概率框架，它优于现有的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对神经隐式 3D 表示中的不确定性进行量化仍然是一个巨大的挑战，特别是在那些利用有符号距离函数 (SDF) 的情况下，由于计算效率低下、可扩展性问题和几何不一致性。现有的方法通常忽略直接几何积分，导致校准不良的不确定性图。需要精确的表面几何形状和对保真表面几何不确定性的认识。

Method: BayesSDF 利用拉普拉斯近似，通过基于 Hessian 的指标量化局部表面不稳定性，从而实现计算高效的、表面感知的不确定性估计。

Result: 不确定性预测与重建不良的几何形状密切相关，为下游使用提供可操作的置信度度量。在合成和真实世界数据集上的大量评估表明，BayesSDF 在校准和几何一致性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BayesSDF在校准和几何一致性方面优于现有方法，为不确定性感知 3D 场景重建、模拟和机器人决策奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

TL;DR: LIRA improves segmentation and comprehension in large multi-modal models by fusing semantic and pixel-level features and generating local descriptions based on segmentation masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) still struggle with inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of fine-grained perception.

Method: LIRA, a framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced Feature Extractor (SEFE); (2) Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC).

Result: The precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. LIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension tasks.

Conclusion: LIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension tasks.

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in
applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form

hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation
techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We
systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent
advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key
academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct,

and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps
and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VOTE的高效通用框架，用于优化和加速VLA模型，通过无分词器的微调和集成投票策略，显著提高了推理速度和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模视觉语言动作（VLA）模型在自然语言引导的机器人操作任务中表现出卓越的性能。然而，当应用于训练分布之外的新物体或不熟悉的环境时，它们的泛化能力仍然有限。为了解决这个问题，许多现有的方法集成了额外的组件，如深度估计、分割，甚至扩散，以提高泛化能力，但代价是增加了大量的计算开销，导致效率低下。这促使人们探索有效的行动预测方法，这种方法独立于额外的高级视觉表征或扩散技术。

Method: 提出了一种新的无分词器的微调方法，用于并行精确的动作预测，并采用了一种集成投票策略进行动作采样。

Result: VOTE方法实现了最先进的性能，推理速度提高了35倍，吞吐量达到了145 Hz。

Conclusion: VOTE方法实现了最先进的性能，推理速度提高了35倍，吞吐量达到了145 Hz。

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: CCPDA方法通过数值分析验证了其在缓解小规模手动标注训练数据集相关困难方面的有效性，并且在改进火灾类别分割性能方面优于其他增强策略。

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

Motivation: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications.

Method: AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean and corrupted images, encourages the model to maintain consistent attention even under input perturbations.

Conclusion: The proposed Multi-Source DPPs method with Tangent Normalization effectively addresses the CDR-CA task, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified

Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for

Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture

Conclusion: PCL-Former在三个数据集上优于当前最优的TAL方法，分别超出2.8%、1.2%和4.8%。

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures
in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the
rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage
architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This
exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer
architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated
transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the
Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may
contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories
within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the
temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate
the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three
challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.
We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each
individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art
TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS
datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: THOR uses thermal sensing and adaptive RGB frame sampling to efficiently capture and classify hand-object interactions with minimal data processing and power consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous processing of RGB images from wearable cameras consumes significant power, generates a large volume of unnecessary video data, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial computational resources.

Method: A real-time adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. It uses low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches from one hand-related activity to another, and adjusts the RGB frame sampling rate.

Result: Using only 3% of the original RGB video data, the method captures all the activity segments, and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to using the entire RGB video (94%).

Conclusion: The method captures all activity segments using only 3% of the original RGB video data, and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to using the entire RGB video (94%). This provides a more practical path for the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and health-risk behaviors in real time.

Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional
tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related
activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging
of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,
continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant
power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video
data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial
computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time
adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal
sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use
low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches
from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling
rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during
periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the
hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in
each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part
of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate
our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30
activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9
countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3%
of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments,
and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to
using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for
the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and
health-risk behaviors in real time.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an event autoencoder for efficient event data compression and reconstruction, achieving comparable accuracy to YOLO-v4 with fewer parameters and higher speed, ideal for real-time edge computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional frame-based vision systems are limited by motion blur, high latency, and redundant data processing in dynamic environments. Event cameras offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object detection due to sparse and noisy event streams.

Method: The paper proposes an event autoencoder architecture with convolutional encoding, adaptive threshold selection, and a lightweight classifier.

Result: The proposed approach achieves comparable accuracy to YOLO-v4 on the SEFD dataset while utilizing up to 35.5x fewer parameters. Implementations on Raspberry Pi 4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano show high frame rates, and the classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The proposed event autoencoder architecture achieves comparable accuracy to YOLO-v4 with significantly fewer parameters and higher FPS on embedded platforms, making it suitable for low-power, high-speed real-time edge computing applications.

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8
FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the
state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance,
making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge
computing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-RTS improves video reasoning with data-efficient RL and adaptive video TTS, achieving better accuracy with significantly fewer training samples, avoiding costly supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based video reasoning methods with LLMs rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations, making them costly and hard to scale.

Method: The method combines data-efficient RL with a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. It employs efficient pure-RL training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or extensive fine-tuning, skipping the resource-intensive SFT step.

Result: Video-RTS surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy using only 3.6% training samples. It achieves a 4.2% improvement on Video-Holmes and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Video-RTS, which combines data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time scaling (TTS) strategy to improve video reasoning capability. The approach surpasses existing models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy using only 3.6% training samples.

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and
adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong
reasoning performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Mask6D预训练策略，结合2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图，以提高在杂乱和遮挡条件下使用单目RGB图像进行6D物体姿态估计的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用单目RGB图像在杂乱或遮挡条件下进行鲁棒的6D物体姿态估计仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务。一个原因是当前的姿态估计网络难以使用2D特征骨干提取有区分性的、姿态感知的特征，特别是当由于杂乱场景中的目标遮挡导致可用的RGB信息有限时。

Method: 提出了一种名为Mask6D的姿态估计特定预训练策略，该策略结合了姿态感知的2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图作为额外的模态信息，并与RGB图像结合用于基于重建的模型预训练。

Result: 经验证，该方法优于先前的端到端姿态估计方法。

Conclusion: 该方法优于先前的端到端姿态估计方法。

Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using
monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current
pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware
features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB
information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate
this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named
Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and
visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB
images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D
correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the
pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the
integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard
cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training
loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the
background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware
network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose
prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous
end-to-end pose estimation methods.

Motivation: 目前还没有一种媒介可以在课堂环境中模拟这些网络，并评估线下计划和线上决策的性能。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了一个名为医疗后送兵棋推演倡议 (MEWI) 的三维多人模拟系统，该系统在 Unity 中开发，复制了战场约束和不确定性，并准确地模拟了患者在伤员收集点、救护车交换点、医疗设施和后送平台上的互动。

Conclusion: MEWI 显著提高了对医疗后送课程的理解和协同决策能力，是医疗教育高保真训练工具领域的一大进步，为改进联合部队的医疗后送教育和行动提供了重要的见解。

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and
critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating
the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing
a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and
treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to
simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline
planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the
Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer
simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and
uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty
collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and
evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious
island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road
and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as
many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during
didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations
of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical
Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from
student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning
decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify
general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially
improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative
decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of
high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings
offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and
operations across the joint force.

By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative representation that is amenable to optimization.

Result: This paper demonstrates PDL's utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent.

Motivation: modeling an agent updating a knowledge base seeking consistency

Result: q-dialectical systems are strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems

Conclusion: q-dialectical systems are strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and research communities.

Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent
updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by
Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working
mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.
Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an
automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief
management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:
(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be
inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding
a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an
open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are
strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known
to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights
the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief
revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and
research communities.

Motivation: SCC-recursive semantics such as \

Method: The authors propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite setting and systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's established criteria.

Result: The authors show that directionality fails in general, but some of their semantics satisfy directionality in finitary frameworks.

Conclusion: This paper advances the theory of infinite argumentation and lays the groundwork for reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a foundational tool in artificial
intelligence for modeling structured reasoning and conflict. SCC-recursiveness
is a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is
decomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack
graph, proceeding recursively from "higher" to "lower" components. While
SCC-recursive semantics such as \cft and \stgt have proven effective for finite
AFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to
generalize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.
  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite
setting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's
established criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in
general. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks,
where we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results
advance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for
reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

Conclusion: InfinityInstruct-Subject数据集提升了模型在指令跟随能力上的表现，并展示出比同类合成数据集更大的覆盖范围和深度。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.
Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage
and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work
lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous
evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to
qualitative improvement.

Method: 该系统维护可能的SQL输出上的分布，并通过用户交互来解决不确定性。在每个交互步骤中，系统选择一个分支决策并制定一个旨在消除查询的歧义的澄清问题。我们采用基于预期信息增益的原则性决策标准来识别在期望中将最大程度地减少SQL分布中的不确定性的澄清。

Result: 该系统通过用户交互来解决不确定性，在每个交互步骤中，系统选择一个分支决策并制定一个旨在消除查询的歧义的澄清问题。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一个交互式的Text-to-SQL框架，该框架将SQL生成建模为多个候选查询上的概率推理过程，并通过用户交互来解决不确定性。

Abstract: Relational databases are foundational to numerous domains, including business
intelligence, scientific research, and enterprise systems. However, accessing
and analyzing structured data often requires proficiency in SQL, which is a
skill that many end users lack. With the development of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) technology, the Text-to-SQL systems attempt to bridge this gap
by translating natural language questions into executable SQL queries via an
automated algorithm. Yet, when operating on complex real-world databases, the
Text-to-SQL systems often suffer from ambiguity due to natural ambiguity in
natural language queries. These ambiguities pose a significant challenge for
existing Text-to-SQL translation systems, which tend to commit early to a
potentially incorrect interpretation. To address this, we propose an
interactive Text-to-SQL framework that models SQL generation as a probabilistic
reasoning process over multiple candidate queries. Rather than producing a
single deterministic output, our system maintains a distribution over possible
SQL outputs and seeks to resolve uncertainty through user interaction. At each
interaction step, the system selects a branching decision and formulates a
clarification question aimed at disambiguating that aspect of the query.
Crucially, we adopt a principled decision criterion based on Expected
Information Gain to identify the clarification that will, in expectation, most
reduce the uncertainty in the SQL distribution.

TL;DR: QUEST通过新颖的优化策略，显著降低了非结构化文档分析中LLM的使用成本，并提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统通常借用关系数据库中流行的查询优化原则来生成查询执行计划，但不幸的是，这些计划在最小化LLM成本方面无效。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了QUEST。

Method: QUEST提出了一种基于索引的策略来最小化每个提取操作的成本。此外，设计了一种证据增强的检索策略，以减少遗漏相关片段的可能性。此外，还开发了一种实例优化的查询执行策略。

Result: QUEST通过采用索引、证据增强检索和实例优化查询执行等创新策略，在非结构化文档分析方面实现了显著的成本节约和性能提升。

Conclusion: QUEST在三个真实世界的数据集上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明QUEST具有优越性，与最先进的基线相比，成本节省了30%-6倍，同时F1评分提高了10%-27%。

Abstract: Most recently, researchers have started building large language models (LLMs)
powered data systems that allow users to analyze unstructured text documents
like working with a database because LLMs are very effective in extracting
attributes from documents. In such systems, LLM-based extraction operations
constitute the performance bottleneck of query execution due to the high
monetary cost and slow LLM inference. Existing systems typically borrow the
query optimization principles popular in relational databases to produce query
execution plans, which unfortunately are ineffective in minimizing LLM cost. To
fill this gap, we propose QUEST, which features a bunch of novel optimization
strategies for unstructured document analysis. First, we introduce an
index-based strategy to minimize the cost of each extraction operation. With
this index, QUEST quickly retrieves the text segments relevant to the target
attributes and only feeds them to LLMs. Furthermore, we design an
evidence-augmented retrieval strategy to reduce the possibility of missing
relevant segments. Moreover, we develop an instance-optimized query execution
strategy: because the attribute extraction cost could vary significantly
document by document, QUEST produces different plans for different documents.
For each document, QUEST produces a plan to minimize the frequency of attribute
extraction. The innovations include LLM cost-aware operator ordering strategies
and an optimized join execution approach that transforms joins into filters.
Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of
QUEST, achieving 30%-6x cost savings while improving the F1 score by 10% -27%
compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

### [44] [USD: A User-Intent-Driven Sampling and Dual-Debiasing Framework for Large-Scale Homepage Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06503)
*Jiaqi Zheng,Cheng Guo,Yi Cao,Chaoqun Hou,Tong Liu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Unified framework for homepage recommendation sampling and debiasing, improving UCTR by addressing exposure and click biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale homepage recommendations suffer from pseudo-negative samples due to exposure bias and overlook pseudo-positive samples like marketing portal visits.

Method: A unified framework with user intent-aware negative sampling and intent-driven dual-debiasing.

Result: Achieved UCTR improvements of 35.4% and 14.5% in two Taobao homepage marketing block variants.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves user click-through rates (UCTR) on Taobao homepage marketing blocks.

Abstract: Large-scale homepage recommendations face critical challenges from
pseudo-negative samples caused by exposure bias, where non-clicks may indicate
inattention rather than disinterest. Existing work lacks thorough analysis of
invalid exposures and typically addresses isolated aspects (e.g., sampling
strategies), overlooking the critical impact of pseudo-positive samples - such
as homepage clicks merely to visit marketing portals. We propose a unified
framework for large-scale homepage recommendation sampling and debiasing. Our
framework consists of two key components: (1) a user intent-aware negative
sampling module to filter invalid exposure samples, and (2) an intent-driven
dual-debiasing module that jointly corrects exposure bias and click bias.
Extensive online experiments on Taobao demonstrate the efficacy of our
framework, achieving significant improvements in user click-through rates
(UCTR) by 35.4\% and 14.5\% in two variants of the marketing block on the
Taobao homepage, Baiyibutie and Taobaomiaosha.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a core approach for enhancing Large
Language Models (LLMs), where the effectiveness of the retriever largely
determines the overall response quality of RAG systems. Retrievers encompass a
multitude of hyperparameters that significantly impact performance outcomes and
demonstrate sensitivity to specific applications. Nevertheless, hyperparameter
optimization entails prohibitively high computational expenses. Existing
evaluation methods suffer from either prohibitive costs or disconnection from
domain-specific scenarios. This paper proposes SEARA (Subset sampling
Evaluation for Automatic Retriever Assessment), which addresses evaluation data
challenges through subset sampling techniques and achieves robust automated
retriever evaluation by minimal retrieval facts extraction and comprehensive
retrieval metrics. Based on real user queries, this method enables fully
automated retriever evaluation at low cost, thereby obtaining optimal retriever
for specific business scenarios. We validate our method across classic RAG
applications in rednote, including knowledge-based Q&A system and

TL;DR: 这项研究通过在更广泛的数据集上复制和扩展先前的研究，分析了儿童的推荐算法消费模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童经常接触由推荐算法策划的项目。然而，研究很少将儿童作为一个用户群体来考虑，而且当它这样做时，它锚定在儿童代表性不足的数据集上，有可能忽视他们的兴趣，而偏袒大多数人，即主流用户。

Method: 在电影、音乐和书籍领域更广泛的数据集上复制和重复先前的研究，并使用受欢迎程度偏差指标扩展了原始研究的见解。

Result: 揭示了跨领域一致的儿童-推荐者互动模式和方面，以及数据中某些用户样本特有的模式和方面。

Conclusion: 揭示了儿童与其他年龄组之间由于内在差异以及特定于特定数据集或领域的差异而产生的消费模式和差异。

Abstract: Children are often exposed to items curated by recommendation algorithms.
Yet, research seldom considers children as a user group, and when it does, it
is anchored on datasets where children are underrepresented, risking
overlooking their interests, favoring those of the majority, i.e., mainstream
users. Recently, Ungruh et al. demonstrated that children's consumption
patterns and preferences differ from those of mainstream users, resulting in
inconsistent recommendation algorithm performance and behavior for this user
group. These findings, however, are based on two datasets with a limited child
user sample. We reproduce and replicate this study on a wider range of datasets
in the movie, music, and book domains, uncovering interaction patterns and
aspects of child-recommender interactions consistent across domains, as well as
those specific to some user samples in the data. We also extend insights from
the original study with popularity bias metrics, given the interpretation of
results from the original study. With this reproduction and extension, we
uncover consumption patterns and differences between age groups stemming from
intrinsic differences between children and others, and those unique to specific
datasets or domains.

Motivation: dense retrieval methods consistently underperform on queries with explicit temporal constraints, Existing approaches to Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) improve temporal reasoning but often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced performance on non-temporal queries.

Method: Time-Specifier Model Merging (TSM), a novel method that enhances temporal retrieval while preserving accuracy on non-temporal queries. TSM trains specialized retrievers for individual time specifiers and merges them in to a unified model

Result: TSM significantly improves performance on temporally constrained queries while maintaining strong results on non-temporal queries, consistently outperforming other baseline methods.

Conclusion: TSM significantly improves performance on temporally constrained queries while maintaining strong results on non-temporal queries, consistently outperforming other baseline methods.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of digital information and knowledge across structured
and unstructured sources has heightened the importance of Information Retrieval
(IR). While dense retrieval methods have substantially improved semantic
matching for general queries, they consistently underperform on queries with
explicit temporal constraints--often those containing numerical expressions and
time specifiers such as ``in 2015.'' Existing approaches to Temporal
Information Retrieval (TIR) improve temporal reasoning but often suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced performance on non-temporal
queries. To address this, we propose Time-Specifier Model Merging (TSM), a
novel method that enhances temporal retrieval while preserving accuracy on
non-temporal queries. TSM trains specialized retrievers for individual time
specifiers and merges them in to a unified model, enabling precise handling of
temporal constraints without compromising non-temporal retrieval. Extensive
experiments on both temporal and non-temporal datasets demonstrate that TSM
significantly improves performance on temporally constrained queries while
maintaining strong results on non-temporal queries, consistently outperforming
other baseline methods. Our code is available at

*Huishi Luo,Yiqing Wu,Yiwen Chen,Fuzhen Zhuang,Deqing Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了因果域聚类（CDC）以提高跨多个领域的推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于显着的域间差异，在统一模型中训练所有域会导致性能下降。现有的基于业务逻辑或数据相似性的域分组方法，通常无法捕捉到最佳分组所需的真实转移关系。

Method: 提出了因果域聚类（CDC）。CDC使用两种不同的效应来模拟大量域中的域转移模式：用于模拟非交互域转移的隔离域亲和力矩阵，以及用于考虑联合训练下动态域协同或干扰的混合域亲和力矩阵。为了整合这两种转移效应，我们引入了因果发现来计算一个基于内聚力的系数，该系数自适应地平衡它们的贡献。一种协同优化动态聚类算法迭代地优化目标域聚类和源域选择以进行训练。

Result: CDC显著提高了公共数据集和工业环境中50多个领域的性能，在线eCPM提高了4.9%。

Conclusion: CDC显著提高了公共数据集和工业环境中50多个领域的性能，在线eCPM提高了4.9%。

Abstract: Multi-domain recommendation leverages domain-general knowledge to improve
recommendations across several domains. However, as platforms expand to dozens
or hundreds of scenarios, training all domains in a unified model leads to
performance degradation due to significant inter-domain differences. Existing
domain grouping methods, based on business logic or data similarities, often
fail to capture the true transfer relationships required for optimal grouping.
To effectively cluster domains, we propose Causal Domain Clustering (CDC). CDC
models domain transfer patterns within a large number of domains using two
distinct effects: the Isolated Domain Affinity Matrix for modeling
non-interactive domain transfers, and the Hybrid Domain Affinity Matrix for
considering dynamic domain synergy or interference under joint training. To
integrate these two transfer effects, we introduce causal discovery to
calculate a cohesion-based coefficient that adaptively balances their
contributions. A Co-Optimized Dynamic Clustering algorithm iteratively
optimizes target domain clustering and source domain selection for training.
CDC significantly enhances performance across over 50 domains on public
datasets and in industrial settings, achieving a 4.9% increase in online eCPM.

Motivation: Deployment cost associated with the large parameter volume of LLMs still hinders their real-world applications.

Method: A three-stage pruning strategy that progressively prunes parameters at different levels and parts of the model, moving from intra-layer to layer-wise pruning, or from width to depth. Each stage also includes a performance restoration step using distillation techniques

Result: Achieve an average of 88% of the original model's performance while pruning more than 95% of the non-embedding parameters across three datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed pruning method significantly reduces resource requirements without greatly compromising recommendation quality, achieving an average of 88% of the original model's performance while pruning more than 95% of the non-embedding parameters.

Abstract: LLM-based recommender systems have made significant progress; however, the
deployment cost associated with the large parameter volume of LLMs still
hinders their real-world applications. This work explores parameter pruning to
improve parameter efficiency while maintaining recommendation quality, thereby
enabling easier deployment. Unlike existing approaches that focus primarily on
inter-layer redundancy, we uncover intra-layer redundancy within components
such as self-attention and MLP modules. Building on this analysis, we propose a
more fine-grained pruning approach that integrates both intra-layer and
layer-wise pruning. Specifically, we introduce a three-stage pruning strategy
that progressively prunes parameters at different levels and parts of the
model, moving from intra-layer to layer-wise pruning, or from width to depth.
Each stage also includes a performance restoration step using distillation
techniques, helping to strike a balance between performance and parameter
efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach:
across three datasets, our models achieve an average of 88% of the original
model's performance while pruning more than 95% of the non-embedding
parameters. This underscores the potential of our method to significantly
reduce resource requirements without greatly compromising recommendation
quality. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/zheng-sl/PruneRec

Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established intervention for Parkinson's
disease (PD), but conventional open-loop systems lack adaptability, are
energy-inefficient due to continuous stimulation, and provide limited
personalization to individual neural dynamics. Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a
closed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to
dynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds
promise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample
complexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited
deployability on resource-constrained hardware.
  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses
the core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a
predictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs
Gumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in
binary action spaces. Together, these components improve sample efficiency,
exploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained
neuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic
simulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster
convergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and
resilience to post-training FP16 quantization. Our results show that SEA-DBS
offers a practical and effective RL-based aDBS framework for real-time,
resource-constrained neuromodulation.

Motivation: Predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes plays a vital role in drug discovery. Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. Self-supervised learning, especially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to break the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast unlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes.

Abstract: We study geometric properties of the gradient flow for learning deep linear
convolutional networks. For linear fully connected networks, it has been shown
recently that the corresponding gradient flow on parameter space can be written
as a Riemannian gradient flow on function space (i.e., on the product of weight
matrices) if the initialization satisfies a so-called balancedness condition.
We establish that the gradient flow on parameter space for learning linear
convolutional networks can be written as a Riemannian gradient flow on function
space regardless of the initialization. This result holds for $D$-dimensional
convolutions with $D \geq 2$, and for $D =1$ it holds if all so-called strides
of the convolutions are greater than one. The corresponding Riemannian metric
depends on the initialization.

Motivation: Complex neural networks require substantial memory to store a large number of synaptic weights.

Method: WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis.

Conclusion: WINGs achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss. This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge applications.

accuracy. WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for
dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models
to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing
full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also
preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using
PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity-aware design also offers
an added level of security, as any bit-flip attack with weights in compressed
layers has an amplified and readily detectable effect on accuracy. WINGs
achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST
dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss.
This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower
energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge
applications.

### [58] [KPFlow: An Operator Perspective on Dynamic Collapse Under Gradient Descent Training of Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06381)
*James Hazelden,Laura Driscoll,Eli Shlizerman,Eric Shea-Brown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper decomposes the gradient flow in recurrent models into two operators, K and P, and demonstrates their applications in understanding low-dimensional latent dynamics and multi-task training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There remains a need for theoretical tools to rigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations, especially in finite, non-linear models.

Method: The gradient flow is decomposed into a Parameter Operator, K, and a Linearized Flow Propagator, P.

Result: The interplay of K and P gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under GD, and the operators can be used to measure how objectives relevant to individual sub-tasks align for multi-task training.

Conclusion: This work moves towards building a next stage of understanding of GD learning in non-linear recurrent models.

Abstract: Gradient Descent (GD) and its variants are the primary tool for enabling
efficient training of recurrent dynamical systems such as Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), Neural ODEs and Gated Recurrent units (GRUs). The dynamics
that are formed in these models exhibit features such as neural collapse and
emergence of latent representations that may support the remarkable
generalization properties of networks. In neuroscience, qualitative features of
these representations are used to compare learning in biological and artificial
systems. Despite recent progress, there remains a need for theoretical tools to
rigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations,
especially in finite, non-linear models. Here, we show that the gradient flow,
which describes how the model's dynamics evolve over GD, can be decomposed into
a product that involves two operators: a Parameter Operator, K, and a
Linearized Flow Propagator, P. K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in
feed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal
control theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we
show how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under
GD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure,
over and above the nature of the underlying task. Second, for multi-task
training, we show that the operators can be used to measure how objectives
relevant to individual sub-tasks align. We experimentally and theoretically
validate these findings, providing an efficient Pytorch package, \emph{KPFlow},
implementing robust analysis tools for general recurrent architectures. Taken
together, our work moves towards building a next stage of understanding of GD
learning in non-linear recurrent models.

Conclusion: CNN, ResNet, and hybrid Transformer-CNN models achieve high accuracy in tamper detection, while hybrid CNN-Transformer Siamese network achieves perfect accuracy in identity verification.

Abstract: With the proliferation of wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) systems for health
monitoring and authentication, protecting signal integrity against tampering is
becoming increasingly important. This paper analyzes the performance of CNN,
ResNet, and hybrid Transformer-CNN models for tamper detection. It also
evaluates the performance of a Siamese network for ECG based identity
verification. Six tampering strategies, including structured segment
substitutions and random insertions, are emulated to mimic real world attacks.
The one-dimensional ECG signals are transformed into a two dimensional
representation in the time frequency domain using the continuous wavelet
transform (CWT). The models are trained and evaluated using ECG data from 54
subjects recorded in four sessions 2019 to 2025 outside of clinical settings
while the subjects performed seven different daily activities. Experimental
results show that in highly fragmented manipulation scenarios, CNN,
FeatCNN-TranCNN, FeatCNN-Tran and ResNet models achieved an accuracy exceeding
99.5 percent . Similarly, for subtle manipulations (for example, 50 percent
from A and 50 percent from B and, 75 percent from A and 25 percent from B
substitutions) our FeatCNN-TranCNN model demonstrated consistently reliable
performance, achieving an average accuracy of 98 percent . For identity
verification, the pure Transformer-Siamese network achieved an average accuracy
of 98.30 percent . In contrast, the hybrid CNN-Transformer Siamese model
delivered perfect verification performance with 100 percent accuracy.

*Mingcheng Zhu,Yu Liu,Zhiyao Luo,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KnowRare是一种基于领域自适应的深度学习框架，用于预测ICU中罕见疾病的临床结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据稀缺和条件内部异质性，ICU中包括公认的罕见疾病和低患病率疾病在内的罕见疾病仍然服务不足。

Method: 我们开发了一个基于领域自适应的深度学习框架KnowRare，用于预测ICU中罕见疾病的临床结果。

Result: 在两个ICU数据集上评估了五个临床预测任务，KnowRare始终优于现有的最先进模型。与包括APACHE IV和IV-a在内的已建立的ICU评分系统相比，KnowRare表现出卓越的预测性能。

Conclusion: KnowRare是一种强大而实用的解决方案，有潜力支持临床决策并改善ICU中罕见疾病的护理。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised critical care for common
conditions. Yet, rare conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), including
recognised rare diseases and low-prevalence conditions in the ICU, remain
underserved due to data scarcity and intra-condition heterogeneity. To bridge
such gaps, we developed KnowRare, a domain adaptation-based deep learning
framework for predicting clinical outcomes for rare conditions in the ICU.
KnowRare mitigates data scarcity by initially learning condition-agnostic
representations from diverse electronic health records through self-supervised
pre-training. It addresses intra-condition heterogeneity by selectively
adapting knowledge from clinically similar conditions with a developed
condition knowledge graph. Evaluated on two ICU datasets across five clinical
prediction tasks (90-day mortality, 30-day readmission, ICU mortality,
remaining length of stay, and phenotyping), KnowRare consistently outperformed
existing state-of-the-art models. Additionally, KnowRare demonstrated superior
predictive performance compared to established ICU scoring systems, including
APACHE IV and IV-a. Case studies further demonstrated KnowRare's flexibility in
adapting its parameters to accommodate dataset-specific and task-specific
characteristics, its generalisation to common conditions under limited data
scenarios, and its rationality in selecting source conditions. These findings
highlight KnowRare's potential as a robust and practical solution for
supporting clinical decision-making and improving care for rare conditions in
the ICU.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个名为eegFloss的开源Python包，它可以提高睡眠研究的分析精度和严谨性以及结果的准确性和可靠性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑电图(EEG)可以监测大脑活动，为了解决脑电信号容易受到伪影的影响，导致错误的睡眠评分的问题。

Method: 该论文介绍了一个名为eegFloss的开源Python包，它利用了一种新的机器学习(ML)模型eegUsability，该模型旨在检测睡眠脑电图记录中包含伪影的片段。此外，eegFloss还提供自动time-in-bed检测等功能，过滤掉某些伪影，并生成睡眠图和睡眠统计数据。

Result: eegUsability在从15名参与者超过127个夜晚收集的手工标记伪影的脑电数据上进行了训练和评估，它展示了可靠的整体分类性能(F1-score约为0.85, Cohens kappa为0.78)，在识别通道方面实现了约94%的高召回率可用的脑电数据，并扩展到Zmax之外。

Conclusion: eegFloss通过解决睡眠研究面临的根本挑战，可以提高其分析的精确性和严谨性，以及结果的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) allows monitoring of brain activity, providing
insights into the functional dynamics of various brain regions and their roles
in cognitive processes. EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the
primary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However,
EEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific)
factors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are
becoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly
susceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper
addresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package
to utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect
segments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained
and evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15
participants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid
overall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens
kappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in
identifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax.
Additionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection
using another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and
generating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental
challenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and
rigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their
outcomes.

TL;DR: 可解释性可以预测OOD模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可解释性研究通常旨在预测模型将如何响应针对特定机制的定向干预。然而，它很少预测模型将如何响应看不见的输入数据。本文探讨了可解释性作为预测超出分布 (OOD) 模型行为的工具的前景和挑战。

Method: 对数百个独立训练的Transformer模型进行相关分析，这些模型在合成分类任务上进行训练。

Result: 当分布内的注意力呈现出分层模式时，该模型很可能在OOD数据上进行分层推广——即使根据消融测试，规则的实现并不依赖于这些分层模式。

Conclusion: 简单的可解释性工具可以预测OOD性能。当分布内的注意力呈现出分层模式时，该模型很可能在OOD数据上进行分层推广——即使根据消融测试，规则的实现并不依赖于这些分层模式。

Abstract: Interpretability research often aims to predict how a model will respond to
targeted interventions on specific mechanisms. However, it rarely predicts how
a model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and
challenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution
(OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between
attention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models
independently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit
several distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse
population for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple
observational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In
particular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the
model is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the
rule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according
to ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further
interpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.

Conclusion: FedPhD在保证模型性能的同时，显著降低了通信成本和计算资源消耗。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed learning paradigm, trains models
over distributed clients' data. FL is particularly beneficial for distributed
training of Diffusion Models (DMs), which are high-quality image generators
that require diverse data. However, challenges such as high communication costs
and data heterogeneity persist in training DMs similar to training Transformers
and Convolutional Neural Networks. Limited research has addressed these issues
in FL environments. To address this gap and challenges, we introduce a novel
approach, FedPhD, designed to efficiently train DMs in FL environments. FedPhD
leverages Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation and
selection policy to tackle data heterogeneity while reducing communication
costs. The distributed structured pruning of FedPhD enhances computational
efficiency and reduces model storage requirements in clients. Our experiments
across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedPhD achieves high model
performance regarding Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores while reducing
communication costs by up to $88\%$. FedPhD outperforms baseline methods
achieving at least a $34\%$ improvement in FID, while utilizing only $56\%$ of
the total computation and communication resources.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) encode rich biological information, yet their
internal neuron representations are poorly understood. We introduce the first
automated framework for labeling every neuron in a PLM with biologically
grounded natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches relying on
sparse autoencoders or manual annotation, our method scales to hundreds of
thousands of neurons, revealing individual neurons are selectively sensitive to
diverse biochemical and structural properties. We then develop a novel neuron
activation-guided steering method to generate proteins with desired traits,
enabling convergence to target biochemical properties like molecular weight and
instability index as well as secondary and tertiary structural motifs,
including alpha helices and canonical Zinc Fingers. We finally show that
analysis of labeled neurons in different model sizes reveals PLM scaling laws
and a structured neuron space distribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces binary stochastic forward-forward algorithms that reduce energy consumption in machine learning with minimal performance loss compared to real-valued alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing energy consumption in machine learning is a pressing need, but backpropagation poses challenges for custom hardware accelerators. Alternatives like forward-forward algorithms exist, but their main bottleneck is matrix multiplication.

Method: Derivation of forward-forward algorithms for binary, stochastic units, using binarization to transform matrix multiplications into indexing operations and tied weights to bypass the information bottleneck.

Result: Evaluation on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets shows performance close to real-valued forward-forward with an estimated energy savings of about one order of magnitude.

Conclusion: The proposed binary stochastic forward-forward algorithms achieve performance close to real-valued forward-forward while saving about one order of magnitude in energy.

Abstract: Reducing energy consumption has become a pressing need for modern machine
learning, which has achieved many of its most impressive results by scaling to
larger and more energy-consumptive neural networks. Unfortunately, the main
algorithm for training such networks, backpropagation, poses significant
challenges for custom hardware accelerators, due to both its serial
dependencies and the memory footprint needed to store forward activations for
the backward pass. Alternatives to backprop, although less effective, do exist;
here the main computational bottleneck becomes matrix multiplication. In this
study, we derive forward-forward algorithms for binary, stochastic units.
Binarization of the activations transforms matrix multiplications into indexing
operations, which can be executed efficiently in hardware. Stochasticity,
combined with tied weights across units with different biases, bypasses the
information bottleneck imposed by binary units. Furthermore, although slow and
expensive in traditional hardware, binary sampling that is very fast can be
implemented cheaply with p-bits (probabilistic bits), novel devices made up of
unstable magnets. We evaluate our proposed algorithms on the MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing that its performance is close to
real-valued forward-forward, but with an estimated energy savings of about one
order of magnitude.
