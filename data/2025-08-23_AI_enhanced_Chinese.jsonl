To address this, we propose a personalized lung\ncancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate\nmodel for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern\nretrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured\nmetadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the\nagent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search\nacross nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient\npopulation from a multi-institutional database.

Recently, research has focused on the\ntemporal $k$-core query, which aims to identify all $k$-cores across all\npossible time sub-intervals within a given query interval. The state-of-the-art\nalgorithm OTCD mitigates redundant computations over overlapping sub-intervals\nby exploiting inclusion relationships among $k$-cores in different time\nintervals.

This strategy enables substantial pruning of\nredundant computations.

Motivated\nby the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the\ncategory level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and\n9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional\ndata? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based\nframework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of\n2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose\nhead, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian\nmatching cost.

Gradient ascent (GA) is a representative method to\nconduct approximate unlearning. However, there still exist dual challenges to\napply GA for session-based recommendation. On the one hand, naive applying of\nGA could lead to degradation of recommendation performance. On the other hand,\nexisting studies fail to consider the ordering of unlearning samples when\nsimultaneously processing multiple unlearning requests, leading to sub-optimal\nrecommendation performance and unlearning effect. To address the above\nchallenges, we introduce CAU, a curriculum approximate unlearning framework\ntailored to session-based recommendation. CAU handles the unlearning task with\na GA term on unlearning samples. Specifically, to address the first challenge,\nCAU formulates the overall optimization task as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem, where the GA term for unlearning samples is combined with retaining\nterms for preserving performance. The multi-objective optimization problem is\nsolved through seeking the Pareto-Optimal solution, which achieves effective\nunlearning with trivial sacrifice on recommendation performance. To tackle the\nsecond challenge, CAU adopts a curriculum-based sequence to conduct unlearning\non batches of unlearning samples.

Diffusion models, though\ncapable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps\nfor adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free\nblack-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces\nadversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional\ndiffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the\nmixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing\nall timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies\nattention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on\ngreen and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing\nmisclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR\nabove 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,\nTAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%\nagainst ShuffleNet.

In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an\nAll-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.\nIt first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available\nrepresentations in the pre-trained foundation model.

While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient\ninformation interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially\naddress this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture\nuser intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into\ngenerative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance.\nHowever, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic\nrepresentations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning\npathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these\nissues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that\nconstructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a\nself-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations.\nSpecifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook\n(MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby\nconstructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance\nthe reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement\nstage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a\nMulti-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions\ntailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA\nintroduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization.

This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can\ninadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability\nregions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does\nthe curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment\nbetween generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional\ncompliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching\nframework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly\nincorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a\nrobust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the\ntrajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017\ndemonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in\ntext-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified\nflow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The\nimprovements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as\nBLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR.

Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of\nnoise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness.\nRecent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models.\nHowever, current two-stage models often filter out significant information,\nresulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the\ncomplete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and\ngenerative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest\nNetwork) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user\ninterest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest\nextraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain\ninterest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between\ninterest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user\ninterests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and\ninterest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented\ninterest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with\nthe latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted\ninterest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the\ngenerated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive\noffline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial\ndataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN.\nMoreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B\ntesting.

To address this, this paper proposes MeSS\n(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent\noutdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While\nimage and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth\nmaps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective\nviews, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion\nmodels excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but\noften struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with\nrendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to\nguarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned\nresults when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach\nenhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The\npipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically\nconsistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we\npropagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and\nthird, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)\nusing the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh\nsurface.

However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either\noperate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the\ncomplementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D\nstructures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To\nholistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the\nfirst feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic\nmulti-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud).

A substantial portion of SLMs' memory\nfootprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and\nlanguage modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static\nvocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,\none-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage\nand a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles\nunderlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,\nthe observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any\nsingle inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between\nvocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce\nVocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that\naddresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a\nhybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling\non-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across\ndiverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of\nup to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or\nno degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static\nvocabulary pruning.", "AI": {"tldr": "VocabTailor \u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bcd\u6c47\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002SLM \u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u5173\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\uff08LM\uff09\u5934\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u5927\u9020\u6210\u7684\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9759\u6001\u8bcd\u6c47\u4fee\u526a\u867d\u7136\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u50f5\u5316\u3001\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa VocabTailor\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8bcd\u6c47\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5378\u8f7d\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u4e3a LM Head \u5b9e\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u9759\u6001-\u52a8\u6001\u8bcd\u6c47\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "VocabTailor \u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe 99% \u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u5173\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5927\u5927\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9759\u6001\u8bcd\u6c47\u4fee\u526a\u3002", "conclusion": "VocabTailor \u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u5173\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In contrast,\npreferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior\ncontribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.\nIn this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to\nunify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled\ntrajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert\ndemonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their\nsimilarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference\nlearning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches\nstruggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning\nfrom preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage\nboth feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSPW\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4e24\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e2\u56f0\u96be\u53c8\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e24\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u6f14\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u9010\u6b65\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f46\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u53cd\u6620\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u54ea\u4e9b\u90e8\u5206\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u6bb5\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u504f\u597d\u52a0\u6743\uff08SPW\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u6e90\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u6807\u8bb0\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2atransition\uff0cSPW\u4ece\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u6839\u636e\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u5bfc\u51fa\u9010\u6b65\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6743\u91cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u6807\u51c6\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "SPW\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u504f\u597d\u548c\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SPW\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u504f\u597d\u548c\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Using\nGemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs\nreduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,\ngreater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often\nimpairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate\nconcept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and\npartial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more\nprecise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,\nwe propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention\nmethod that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted\nsuppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper evaluates sparse autoencoders (SAEs) against base models concerning monosemanticity, showing that SAEs reduce polysemanticity and enable more precise concept-level control.

These models are often trained on\nnumerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic\ncreations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and\ndistribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a\ntraining-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating\nvideos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those\nconcepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly\nintegrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:\nSelective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise\nGuidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including\nobject erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content\nerasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms\nprior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and\ngeneralizability.

Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source\nof the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the\nlanguage model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and\noptimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,\nformalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce\nthis complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so\nfurther growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A\nword-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce\ncross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most\nfrequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and\noutput embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance\nreverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers\nfrom imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in\ndownstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show\nthat enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same\nfrequent-word benefit.

However, manual inspection of EEG\ncharacteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.\nAlthough machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively\ndeveloped, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and\nvariability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)\nsignals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets.

Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG\nsignals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for\ntime series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial\nand temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG\nrepresentation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling\ngeneralization to unseen target datasets.

While prior\nwork typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward\nsignals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent\ncontributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted\nthat are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing\nthe policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents\ntend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the\nlikelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a\nmethod based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each\nagent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.\nSpecifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies\nby assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment.

Using\ncross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and\nphilosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim\nis that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of\nbecoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.\nTo address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian\nphilosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the\nAI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and\nindividuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the\nself-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens\npersonalisation, and expands application domains.

To address these limitations, we propose an\nImage-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially\nenhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes\nafter archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly\nexploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared\ncodebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to\npreviously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.\nThis approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the\nkilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to\npost-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images\ncaptured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes\nare trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized\nrepresentations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding.

When input views become extremely sparse,\nthe Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization\nfails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,\nresulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel\nSfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs\n3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we\npropose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose\ninformation and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To\naddress the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view\nsettings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates\ncamera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent\ncontent as additional supervision signals for training.

However,\nexisting lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and\nrarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely\nrestricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,\ncurrent architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same\nconvolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature\nextraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel\nlightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet\nemploys heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency\ninformation while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model\nintegrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture\nlow-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public\ndatasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art\nmethods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot\ngeneralization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for\nreal-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios.

It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such\nas remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant\nadvancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality\nmisalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.\nTo address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for\ntask-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.\nAdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet\nTransform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba\nBlocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-\nand low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,\nenabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency\ncharacteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks\nfacilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing\nthis process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to\nensure robust fusion across diverse modalities.

In the first stage, the input\nsketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are\ndefined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In\nthe second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which\nrefines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,\nleveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates\nspecialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to\nimprove temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\napproach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,\ntemporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus\nexpanding the practical applications of sketch animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "GroupSketch \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u8349\u56fe\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u5bf9\u8c61\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u906d\u53d7\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "GroupSketch \u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8fd0\u52a8\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ec6\u5316\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d2\u503c\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u7565\u52a8\u753b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u7f51\u7edc (GDN)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u573a\u6765\u7ec6\u5316\u7c97\u7565\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002GDN \u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6761\u4ef6\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a (CCFE)\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "GroupSketch \u5728\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GroupSketch \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8349\u56fe\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}
