However, real-world adoption remains elusive due to the limited ability of traditional relational query operators to capture query semantics. The emergence of foundation models, particularly the large language models (LLMs), opens up new opportunities to develop flexible, semantic-aware data analytics systems that transcend the relational paradigm.\n  We present Nirvana, a multi-modal data analytics framework that incorporates programmable semantic operators while leveraging both logical and physical query optimization strategies, tailored for LLM-driven semantic query processing. Nirvana addresses two key challenges. First, it features an agentic logical optimizer that uses natural language-specified transformation rules and random-walk-based search to explore vast spaces of semantically equivalent query plans -- far beyond the capabilities of conventional optimizers. Second, it introduces a cost-aware physical optimizer that selects the most effective LLM backend for each operator using a novel improvement-score metric. To further enhance efficiency, Nirvana incorporates computation reuse and evaluation pushdown techniques guided by model capability hypotheses. Experimental evaluations on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that Nirvana is able to reduce end-to-end runtime by 10%--85% and reduces system processing costs by 76% on average, outperforming state-of-the-art systems at both efficiency and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Nirvana\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(llm)\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7269\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u7cfb\u67e5\u8be2\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u6355\u83b7\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5904\u7406\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "Nirvana\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u6570\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684LLM\u540e\u7aef\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0cNirvana\u8fd8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u63a8\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNirvana\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1110%--85%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u6210\u672c\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e76%\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "Nirvana\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

To appear", "summary": "Diverse types of edge data, such as 2D geo-locations and 3D point clouds, are collected by sensors like lidar and GPS receivers on edge devices. On-device searches, such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search and radius search, are commonly used to enable fast analytics and learning technologies, such as k-means dataset simplification using kNN. To maintain high search efficiency, a representative approach is to utilize a balanced multi-way KD-tree (BMKD-tree). However, the index has shown limited gains, mainly due to substantial construction overhead, inflexibility to real-time insertion, and inconsistent query performance. In this paper, we propose UnIS to address the above limitations. We first accelerate the construction process of the BMKD-tree by utilizing the dataset distribution to predict the splitting hyperplanes. To make the continuously generated data searchable, we propose a selective sub-tree rebuilding scheme to accelerate rebalancing during insertion by reducing the number of data points involved. We then propose an auto-selection model to improve query performance by automatically selecting the optimal search strategy among multiple strategies for an arbitrary query task. Experimental results show that UnIS achieves average speedups of 17.96x in index construction, 1.60x in insertion, 7.15x in kNN search, and 1.09x in radius search compared to the BMKD-tree. We further verify its effectiveness in accelerating dataset simplification on edge devices, achieving a speedup of 217x over Lloyd's algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aUnIS\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u8defKD\u6811\uff08BMKD-tree\uff09\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u6784\u5efa\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u63d2\u5165\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684BMKD-tree\u7d22\u5f15\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6784\u5efa\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u63d2\u5165\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u4ee5\u53ca\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5272\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u52a0\u901fBMKD-tree\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5b50\u6811\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u63d2\u5165\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u67e5\u8be2\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u591a\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0eBMKD-tree\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cUnIS\u5728\u7d22\u5f15\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u63d2\u5165\u3001kNN\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u534a\u5f84\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u9762\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u574717.96\u500d\u30011.60\u500d\u30017.15\u500d\u548c1.09\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cUnIS\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7b80\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4Lloyd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86217\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "UnIS\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7d22\u5f15\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u63d2\u5165\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u6570\u636e\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7b80\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose SCoTER (Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation), a unified framework that treats pattern discovery and structure-aware transfer as a jointly optimized problem. Specifically, SCoTER operationalizes this through two synergistic components: a GVM pipeline for automated pattern discovery and a structure-preserving integration architecture that transfers stepwise logic to efficient models.

While edge-DP, which protects privacy at the edge level, has been extensively studied, node-DP, offering stronger protection for entire nodes and their incident edges, remains largely underexplored due to its technical challenges. A natural way to bridge this gap is to develop a general framework for reducing node-DP graph analytical tasks to edge-DP ones, enabling the reuse of existing edge-DP mechanisms. A straightforward solution based on group privacy divides the privacy budget by a given degree upper bound, but this leads to poor utility when the bound is set conservatively large to accommodate worst-case inputs. To address this, we propose node-to-edge (N2E), a general framework that reduces any node-DP graph analytical task to an edge-DP one, with the error dependency on the graph's true maximum degree. N2E introduces two novel techniques: a distance-preserving clipping mechanism that bounds edge distance between neighboring graphs after clipping, and the first node-DP mechanism for maximum degree approximation, enabling tight, privacy-preserving clipping thresholds. By instantiating N2E with existing edge-DP mechanisms, we obtain the first node-DP solutions for tasks such as maximum degree estimation. For edge counting, our method theoretically matches the error of the state-of-the-art, which is provably optimal, and significantly outperforms existing approaches for degree distribution estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves up to a 2.5x reduction in error for edge counting and up to an 80x reduction for degree distribution estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aN2E\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u8fb9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fb9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fb9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u8282\u70b9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u56e0\u5176\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u800c\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u8282\u70b9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "N2E\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fdd\u6301\u526a\u88c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9650\u5236\u526a\u88c1\u540e\u76f8\u90bb\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u526a\u88c1\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fb9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316N2E\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fb9\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8fb9\u8ba1\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe2.5\u500d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5728\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe80\u500d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "N2E\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8fb9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Despite current progress, the imbalance issue and transition issue hinder further development of CDSR. The former one presents a phenomenon that the interactions in one domain dominate the entire behavior, leading to difficulty in capturing the domain-specific features in the other domain. The latter points to the difficulty in capturing users' cross-domain preferences within the mixed interaction sequence, resulting in poor next-item prediction performance for specific domains. With world knowledge and powerful reasoning ability, Large Language Models (LLMs) partially alleviate the above issues by performing as a generator and an encoder. However, current LLMs-enhanced CDSR methods are still under exploration, which fail to recognize the irrelevant noise and rough profiling problems. Thus, to make peace with the aforementioned challenges, we proposed an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation with Dual-phase Training ({LLM-EDT}). To address the imbalance issue while introducing less irrelevant noise, we first propose the transferable item augmenter to adaptively generate possible cross-domain behaviors for users. Then, to alleviate the transition issue, we introduce a dual-phase training strategy to empower the domain-specific thread with a domain-shared background. As for the rough profiling problem, we devise a domain-aware profiling module to summarize the user's preference in each domain and adaptively aggregate them to generate comprehensive user profiles. The experiments on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-EDT.

Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation.

The massive amount of data generated; by the propensity of tourists to share comments and photos during their trip; makes it possible to model their journeys and analyze their behavior. Predicting the next movement of tourists plays a key role in tourism marketing to understand demand and improve decision support. In this paper, we propose a method to understand and to learn tourists' movements based on social network data analysis to predict future movements. The method relies on a machine learning grammatical inference algorithm. A major contribution in this paper is to adapt the grammatical inference algorithm to the context of big data. Our method produces a hidden Markov model representing the movements of a group of tourists. The hidden Markov model is flexible and editable with new data.

Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care.

A Case Study on Emotion Detection in Persian", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate self-explanations alongside their predictions, a practice that raises concerns about the faithfulness of these explanations, especially in low-resource languages. This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in the context of emotion classification in Persian, a low-resource language, by comparing the influential words identified by the model against those identified by human annotators. We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments.

In this work, we present PIGReward, a personalized reward model that dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions and assesses images through CoT reasoning. To address the scarcity of user data, PIGReward adopt a self-bootstrapping strategy that reasons over limited reference data to construct rich user contexts, enabling personalization without user-specific training. Beyond evaluation, PIGReward provides personalized feedback that drives user-specific prompt optimization, improving alignment between generated images and individual intent. We further introduce PIGBench, a per-user preference benchmark capturing diverse visual interpretations of shared prompts.

Prior work relies on accuracy-based approaches, interpreting performance drops after removing a modality as indicative of its influence. However, such outcome-driven metrics fail to distinguish whether a modality is inherently informative or whether its value arises only through interaction with other modalities. This distinction is particularly important in cross-attention architectures, where modalities influence each other's representations. In this work, we propose a framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that quantifies modality contributions by decomposing predictive information in internal embeddings into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. To enable scalable, inference-only analysis, we develop an algorithm based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) that computes layer and dataset-level contributions without retraining.

While LLMs have thrived on abundant textual data, no comparable corpus exists for CUA trajectories. To address these gaps, we introduce FaraGen, a novel synthetic data generation system for multi-step web tasks. FaraGen can propose diverse tasks from frequently used websites, generate multiple solution attempts, and filter successful trajectories using multiple verifiers. It achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity for multi-step web tasks, producing verified trajectories at approximately $1 each. We use this data to train Fara-7B, a native CUA model that perceives the computer using only screenshots, executes actions via predicted coordinates, and is small enough to run on-device. We find that Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks like WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench -- our novel benchmark that better captures under-represented web tasks in pre-existing benchmarks. Furthermore, Fara-7B is competitive with much larger frontier models, illustrating key benefits of scalable data generation systems in advancing small efficient agentic models.

Specifically, data deletion, a core component of machine unlearning, faces three critical challenges in learned CE models: attribute-level sensitivity, inter-table propagation and domain disappearance leading to severe overestimation in multi-way joins. We propose Cardinality Estimation Pruning (CEP), the first unlearning framework specifically designed for multi-table learned CE systems. CEP introduces Distribution Sensitivity Pruning, which constructs semi-join deletion results and computes sensitivity scores to guide parameter pruning, and Domain Pruning, which removes support for value domains entirely eliminated by deletion. We evaluate CEP on state-of-the-art architectures NeuroCard and FACE across IMDB and TPC-H datasets. Results demonstrate CEP consistently achieves the lowest Q-error in multi-table scenarios, particularly under high deletion ratios, often outperforming full retraining. Furthermore, CEP significantly reduces convergence iterations, incurring negligible computational overhead of 0.3%-2.5% of fine-tuning time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u591a\u8868\u5b66\u4e60CE\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684machine unlearning\u6846\u67b6CEP\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5220\u9664\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08CE\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u8868\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0cmachine unlearning\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7684CE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5220\u9664\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u8868\u95f4\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u57df\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u8def\u8fde\u63a5\u4e2d\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002", "method": "CEP\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u654f\u611f\u6027\u526a\u679d\uff08Distribution Sensitivity Pruning\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u534a\u8fde\u63a5\u5220\u9664\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u53c2\u6570\u526a\u679d\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u57df\u526a\u679d\uff08Domain Pruning\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u5220\u9664\u5220\u9664\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d88\u9664\u7684\u503c\u57df\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u5728IMDB\u548cTPC-H\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684NeuroCard\u548cFACE\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCEP\u5728\u591a\u8868\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f4e\u7684Q-error\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5220\u9664\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cCEP\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ec5\u5360\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u95f4\u76840.3%-2.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "CEP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684machine unlearning\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u654f\u611f\u6027\u526a\u679d\u548c\u57df\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Though the influence function was proposed for attributing how infinitesimal up-weighting or removal of individual training examples affects model outputs, its implementation is still challenging in deep-learning vision models: inverse-curvature computations are expensive, and training non-stationarity invalidates static approximations. Prior works use iterative solvers and low-rank surrogates to reduce cost, but offline computation lags behind training dynamics, and missing confidence calibration yields fragile rankings that misidentify critical examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF), the first framework that treats algorithmic stability as a real-time controller, which (i) maintains lightweight anchor IHVPs via stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann; (ii) proposes modular curvature backends to modulate per-example influence scores using stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence. Experimental results show that SG-OIF achieves SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) on noise-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across multiple datasets with various corruption. Notably, our approach achieves 91.1\\% accuracy in the top 1\\% prediction samples on the CIFAR-10 (20\\% asym), and gets 99.8\\% AUPR score on MNIST, effectively demonstrating that this framework is a practical controller for online influence estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bad\u7ec3\u70b9\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9006\u66f2\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d77\u6765\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u79bb\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ede\u540e\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a Richardson \u548c\u9884\u5904\u7406 Neumann \u7ef4\u62a4\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7 anchor IHVP\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u540e\u7aef\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u9608\u503c\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u95e8\u63a7\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "SG-OIF \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9488\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) \u6548\u679c\u3002\u5728 CIFAR-10 (20% asym) \u4e0a\uff0c\u524d 1% \u9884\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u5230 91.1%\uff0c\u5728 MNIST \u4e0a AUPR \u5f97\u5206\u4e3a 99.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002"}}

The aim is to allow rewrites to alter the structure and syntactic outcome of an original query while keeping the obtainable insights intact. This drastically differs from traditional query rewriting, which typically aims to decrease query evaluation time by using strict equivalence rules and optimization heuristics on the query plan. Rewriting queries to queries that only provide a similar insight but otherwise can be entirely different can remedy inaccessible original data tables due to access control, privacy, or expensive data access regarding monetary cost or remote access. In this paper, we put forward INQURE, a system designed for INtent-based QUery REwriting. It uses access to a large language model (LLM) for the query understanding and human-like derivation of alternate queries. Around the LLM, INQURE employs upfront table filtering and subsequent candidate rewrite pruning and ranking.

Existing cross-disciplinary methods rely on overlapping entities between disciplines for knowledge transfer through simple mapping functions, but suffer from two key limitations: (1) overlapping entities are scarce in real-world scenarios, and (2) simple mappings inadequately capture cross-disciplinary knowledge complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mixed of Experts and Adversarial Generative Network-based Cross-disciplinary Cold-start Knowledge Tracing Framework. Our approach consists of three key components: First, we pre-train a source discipline model and cluster student knowledge states into K categories. Second, these cluster attributes guide a mixture-of-experts network through a gating mechanism, serving as a cross-domain mapping bridge.

Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention.

To avoid the redundant AI/ML computations caused by repeated data records in the join's output, factorized ML has been proposed to decompose ML computations into sub-computations to be executed on each normalized dataset. However, there is insufficient discussion on how factorized ML could impact AI/ML inference over multi-way joins. To address the limitations, we propose a novel declarative InferF system, focusing on the factorization of arbitrary inference workflows represented as analyzable expressions over the multi-way joins. We formalize our problem to flexibly push down partial factorized computations to qualified nodes in the join tree to minimize the overall inference computation and join costs and propose two algorithms to resolve the problem: (1) a greedy algorithm based on a per-node cost function that estimates the influence on overall latency if a subset of factorized computations is pushed to a node, and (2) a genetic algorithm for iteratively enumerating and evaluating promising factorization plans. We implement InferF on Velox, an open-sourced database engine from Meta, evaluate it on real-world datasets, observed up to 11.3x speedups, and systematically summarized the factors that determine when factorized ML can benefit AI/ML inference workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aInferF\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u8def\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0a\u7684AI/ML\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3ML\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8def\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0a\u7684AI/ML\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cInferF\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe11.3\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3ML\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AI/ML\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u51b3\u5b9a\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

This stems primarily from their prominent capability in distilling, modeling, and generating comprehensive user preferences. However, previous work fails to examine DMs in recommendation tasks through a rigorous lens. In this paper, we first experimentally investigate the completeness of recommender models from a thermodynamic view. We reveal that existing DM-based recommender models operate by maximizing the energy, while classic recommender models operate by reducing the entropy. Based on this finding, we propose a minimalistic diffusion framework that incorporates both factors via the maximization of Helmholtz free energy. Meanwhile, to foster the optimization, our reverse process is armed with a well-designed denoiser to maintain the inherent anisotropy, which measures the user-item cross-correlation in the context of bipartite graphs. Finally, we adopt an Acceptance-Rejection Gumbel Sampling Process (AR-GSP) to prioritize the far-outnumbered unobserved interactions for model robustness. AR-GSP integrates an acceptance-rejection sampling to ensure high-quality hard negative samples for general recommendation tasks, and a timestep-dependent Gumbel Softmax to handle an adaptive sampling strategy for diffusion models.

Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training.

However, their modular structure introduces a unique vulnerability: adversaries can attempt to compress or repurpose models by pruning experts and cheaply fine-tuning the remainder, effectively bypassing licensing and security constraints. In this paper, we systematically study the prunability of MoE-LLMs under task-specific usage. We first develop an expert attribution framework that identifies the subset of experts most responsible for a given task, then evaluate the performance trade-offs of pruning and re-aligning these experts using active learning-driven fine-tuning. Our findings reveal a critical knowledge loss--recovery trade-off: while certain experts can be isolated to retain task accuracy, significant degradation occurs without targeted re-alignment. Based on this analysis, we propose defense strategies that aim to make MoE models harder to compress and fine-tune without authorization, including entangled expert training and selective fine-tuning protocols that resist unauthorized adaptation.

Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy.

GED is determined by an optimal alignment between a pair of graphs that partitions each into aligned (zero-cost) and unaligned (cost-incurring) substructures. Due to NP-hard nature of exact GED computation, GED approximations based on Graph Neural Network(GNN) have emerged. Existing GNN-based GED approaches typically learn node embeddings for each graph and then aggregate pairwise node similarities to estimate the final similarity. Despite their effectiveness, we identify a mismatch between this prevalent node-centric matching paradigm and the core principles of GED. This discrepancy leads to two critical limitations: (1) a failure to capture the global structural correspondence for optimal alignment, and (2) a misattribution of edit costs driven by spurious node level signals. To address these limitations, we propose GCGSim, a GED-consistent graph similarity learning framework centering on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs. Specifically, we make three core technical contributions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GCGSim achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, traditional collaborative filtering-based sequential recommendation models often lead to suboptimal performance due to the limited information of their collaborative signals. With the rapid development of LLMs, an increasing number of works have incorporated LLMs' world knowledge into sequential recommendation. Although they achieve considerable gains, these approaches typically assume the correctness of LLM-generated results and remain susceptible to noise induced by LLM hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRASP (Generation Augmented Retrieval with Holistic Attention for Sequential Prediction), a flexible framework that integrates generation augmented retrieval for descriptive synthesis and similarity retrieval, and holistic attention enhancement which employs multi-level attention to effectively employ LLM's world knowledge even with hallucinations and better capture users' dynamic interests. The retrieved similar users/items serve as auxiliary contextual information for the later holistic attention enhancement module, effectively mitigating the noisy guidance of supervision-based methods. Comprehensive evaluations on two public benchmarks and one industrial dataset reveal that GRASP consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance when integrated with diverse backbones.

The relative orientation of a 3D reference object can be determined from a 3D rotated version of that object, or from a projection of the rotated object to a 2D planar image. This projection can be a perspective projection (the PnP problem) or an orthographic projection (the OnP problem). We restrict our attention here to the OnP problem and the full 3D pose estimation task (the EnP problem). Here we solve the least squares systems for both the error-free EnP and OnP problems in terms of the determinant ratio matrix (DRaM) approach. The noisy-data case can be addressed with a straightforward rotation correction scheme. While the SVD and optimal quaternion eigensystem methods solve the noisy EnP 3D-3D alignment exactly, the noisy 3D-2D orthographic (OnP) task has no known comparable closed form, and can be solved by DRaM-class methods. We note that while previous similar work has been presented in the literature exploiting both the QR decomposition and the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse transformations, here we place these methods in a larger context that has not previously been fully recognized in the absence of the corresponding DRaM solution. We term this class of solutions as the DRaM family, and conduct comparisons of the behavior of the families of solutions for the EnP and OnP rotation estimation problems. Overall, this work presents both a new solution to the 3D and 2D orthographic pose estimation problems and provides valuable insight into these classes of problems.

In response to the performance bottleneck of existing models in processing tabular features, this paper proposes an XGBoost machine learning regression model based on feature engineering and particle swarm optimization. Correlation analysis shows that answer_quality is positively correlated with doc_delevance by 0.66, indicating that document relevance has a significant positive effect on answer quality, and improving document relevance may enhance answer quality; The strong negative correlations between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity were -0.89 and -0.88, respectively, indicating a tradeoff between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity. In other words, as the former two increased, diversity significantly decreased. The experimental results comparing decision trees, AdaBoost, etc. show that the VMD PSO BiLSTM model is superior in all evaluation indicators, with significantly lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE compared to the comparison model.

To bridge this gap, we propose HKRAG, a new holistic RAG framework designed to explicitly capture and integrate both knowledge types. Our framework features two key components: (1) a Hybrid Masking-based Holistic Retriever that employs explicit masking strategies to separately model salient and fine-print knowledge, ensuring a query-relevant holistic information retrieval; and (2) an Uncertainty-guided Agentic Generator that dynamically assesses the uncertainty of initial answers and actively decides how to integrate the two distinct knowledge streams for optimal response generation.

While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u6587\u5b57\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u5728AI for Social Good\u3001AI in Education\u6216\u8425\u9500\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u5404\u79cd\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u7528\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u4e3a\u82f1\u8bed\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u5b57\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u88ab\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5982\u5e26\u6709\u76f8\u5e94\u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u6765\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u6807\u6ce8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u5e26\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u5355\u8bcd\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ee566%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6807\u6ce8\u82f1\u8bed\u63a8\u6587\uff0c\u4ee569%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6807\u6ce8Sepedi\u63a8\u6587\uff0c\u4ee563%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6807\u6ce8Setswana\u63a8\u6587\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5e73\u5747\u53ea\u670934%\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose OmniTFT, a deep learning framework that jointly learns and forecasts high-frequency vital signs and sparsely sampled laboratory results based on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT).

By reducing the reliance on target-specific architectures and extensive feature engineering, OmniTFT enables unified modeling of multiple heterogeneous clinical targets while preserving cross-institutional generalizability. Across forecasting tasks, OmniTFT achieves substantial performance improvement for both vital signs and laboratory results on the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU datasets.

Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies.

Building on this perspective, we propose Orthogonal Filtering, a lightweight module that adaptively clusters redundant tokens into a compact set of orthogonal bases. Through extensive experiments across a range of ViT models, we reveal a consistent token, model scaling law: larger models require significantly fewer tokens to span visual semantic space.

Two primary approaches can be applied to improve the performance of LLMs: fine-tuning, which aligns LLM predictions more closely with human responses, and rectification, which corrects biases in LLM outputs. In this paper, we develop a framework that combines fine-tuning and rectification, and optimally allocates limited labeled samples across the two stages. Unlike the conventional objective that minimizes the mean squared prediction errors, we propose to minimize the variance of the prediction errors as the fine-tuning objective, which is optimal for the downstream rectification stage. Building on this insight, we leverage empirical scaling laws to develop a data-driven method for optimally splitting samples between the fine-tuning and rectification stages.

To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently.

EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines. Our results confirm that R2R is a model-agnostic and modular approach to domain specialization with strong cross-domain robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "R2R\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u548cEAG\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3decoder-only reranker\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8fc7\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14naive\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "R2R\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u4e0eEAG\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002EAG\u901a\u8fc7\u5c4f\u853d\u6700\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7ebf\u7d22\u6765\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u6377\u5f84\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7freranker\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002R2R\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u63a2\u6d4b\u6765\u81ea\u51bb\u7ed3\u9aa8\u5e72\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7684LoRA\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684reranker\u9aa8\u5e72\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u91d1\u878d\uff09\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cR2R\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5355\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "R2R\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Large language models (LLMs) may help detect and correct such errors, but their behavior under different prompting strategies remains unclear. We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.\n  Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.\n  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.\n  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting.

To address these limitations, we introduce GroundingAgent, a novel agentic visual grounding framework that operates without any task-specific fine-tuning. GroundingAgent employs a structured, iterative reasoning mechanism that integrates pretrained open-vocabulary object detectors, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and large language models (LLMs) to progressively refine candidate regions through joint semantic and spatial analyses. Remarkably, GroundingAgent achieves an average zero-shot grounding accuracy of 65.1 % on widely-used benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg), entirely without fine-tuning. Furthermore, by substituting MLLM-generated captions with the original query texts, the accuracy at the selection stage alone reaches approximately 90 %, closely matching supervised performance and underscoring the critical role of LLM reasoning capabilities.

Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models.

We show that whenever similarity between concepts can be expressed as monotone witness overlap -- whether arising from graph neighborhoods, causal relations, temporal structure, topological features, symbolic patterns, or embedding-based neighborhoods -- it admits a reduction to compact encodings with provable ranking preservation guarantees. REWA systems consist of: (1) finite witness sets $W(v)$, (2) semi-random bit assignments generated from each witness, and (3) monotonicity of expected similarity in the overlap $\u0394(u, v) = |W(u) \\cap W(v)|$. We prove that under an overlap-gap condition on the final witness sets -- independent of how they were constructed -- top-$k$ rankings are preserved using $m = O(\\log(|V|/\u03b4))$ bits. The witness-set formulation is compositional: any sequence of structural, temporal, causal, topological, information-theoretic, or learned transformations can be combined into pipelines that terminate in discrete witness sets. The theory applies to the final witness overlap, enabling modular construction of similarity systems from reusable primitives. This yields a vast design space: millions of composable similarity definitions inherit logarithmic encoding complexity. REWA subsumes and unifies Bloom filters, minhash, LSH bitmaps, random projections, sketches, and hierarchical filters as special cases. It provides a principled foundation for similarity systems whose behavior is governed by witness overlap rather than hash-function engineering.

For CUAs to operate effectively, application selection, which refers to deciding which application to use before invoking fine-grained tools such as APIs, is a fundamental capability. It determines whether the agent initializes the correct environment, avoids orchestration confusion, and efficiently focuses on relevant context. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess fine-grained API selection, offering limited insight into whether models can reason across and choose between different applications. To fill this gap, we introduce AppSelectBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating application selection in CUAs. AppSelectBench contains a novel user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, together with unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented-settings. AppSelectBench covers one hundred widely used desktop applications and includes more than one hundred thousand realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user tasks. Extensive experiments across both closed-source and open-source large language models reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing that even the most capable models still struggle to make consistent application choices. Together, these results establish AppSelectBench as a foundation for studying and advancing application level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs.

Existing compression methods often rely on heuristic importance metrics or empirical pruning rules, lacking theoretical guarantees about information preservation. In this work, we propose InfoPrune, an information-theoretic framework for adaptive structural compression of VLMs. Grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, we formulate pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies. To quantify the contribution of each attention head, we introduce an entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and employ the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) distance to measure the divergence between original and compressed structures. This yields a unified criterion that jointly considers structural sparsity and informational efficiency. Building on this foundation, we further design two complementary schemes: (1) a training-based head pruning guided by the proposed information loss objective, and (2) a training-free FFN compression via adaptive low-rank approximation.

However, existing CSI feedback models struggle to adapt to dynamic environments caused by user mobility, requiring retraining when encountering new CSI distributions. Moreover, returning to previously encountered environments often leads to performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning involves enabling models to incorporate new information while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based learning approach for CSI feedback. By using a GAN generator as a memory unit, our method preserves knowledge from past environments and ensures consistently high performance across diverse scenarios without forgetting.

Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.\n  We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $\u03c9$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately.

We introduce the Eyelid Angle (ELA), a novel, reproducible metric of eye openness derived from 3D facial landmarks. Unlike conventional binary eye state estimators or 2D measures, such as the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the ELA provides a stable geometric description of eyelid motion that is robust to variations in camera angle. Using the ELA, we design a blink detection framework that extracts temporal characteristics, including the closing, closed, and reopening durations, which are shown to correlate with drowsiness levels. To address the scarcity and risk of collecting natural drowsiness data, we further leverage ELA signals to animate rigged avatars in Blender 3D, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic datasets with controllable noise, camera viewpoints, and blink dynamics. Experimental results in public driver monitoring datasets demonstrate that the ELA offers lower variance under viewpoint changes compared to EAR and achieves accurate blink detection. At the same time, synthetic augmentation expands the diversity of training data for drowsiness recognition. Our findings highlight the ELA as both a reliable biometric measure and a powerful tool for generating scalable datasets in driver state monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u773c\u7751\u89d2\u5ea6\uff08ELA\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u7684\u55dc\u7761\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7ELA\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7728\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u55dc\u7761\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5229\u7528ELA\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u7684\u55dc\u7761\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ADAS\uff09\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u773c\u7751\u89d2\u5ea6\uff08ELA\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u4ece3D\u9762\u90e8\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u5bfc\u51fa\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u773c\u7751\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528ELA\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7728\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u95ed\u5408\u3001\u95ed\u5408\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u7741\u5f00\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u55dc\u7761\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5229\u7528ELA\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u52a8\u753bBlender 3D\u4e2d\u7684\u88c5\u5907\u5316\u8eab\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u521b\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u63a7\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u70b9\u548c\u7728\u773c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u903c\u771f\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u76d1\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0eEAR\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cELA\u5728\u89c6\u70b9\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7728\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u55dc\u7761\u8bc6\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ELA\u65e2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\\% compared to traditional instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand.

Code available at https://github.com/mihirs-0/synass", "summary": "Transformers are theoretically reversal-invariant: their function class does not prefer left-to-right over right-to-left mappings. Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a \"reversal curse,\" and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Transformers\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u662f\u53ef\u9006\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5728\u9006\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GPT-2\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660eTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u672c\u8eab\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u53cd\u590d\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u201c\u9006\u8f6c\u8bc5\u5492\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5e26\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7bad\u5934\u3002\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u67b6\u6784\u672c\u8eab\uff1f", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8c03\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50K\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u96f6\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5177\u6709\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u71b5\u5e95\u7684\u9006\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b63\u5411\u548c\u9006\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GPT-2\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728K=5\u65f6\u4e3a1.16nats\uff09\uff0c\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684MLP\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u800cLoRA\u5728\u9ad8\u71b5\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u4e0a\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u58c1\u5792\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u3001token\u9891\u7387\u548c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u540e\uff0c\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5256\u6790\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9Transformer\u6765\u8bf4\u4ecd\u7136 \u0444\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u56f0\u96be\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, most of them adopt static and non-learnable tool invocation mechanisms, which limit the discovery of diverse clues essential for robust perception and reasoning regarding temporally or spatially complex videos. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-agent system for video understanding, namely VideoChat-M1. Instead of using a single or fixed policy, VideoChat-M1 adopts a distinct Collaborative Policy Planning (CPP) paradigm with multiple policy agents, which comprises three key processes. (1) Policy Generation: Each agent generates its unique tool invocation policy tailored to the user's query; (2) Policy Execution: Each agent sequentially invokes relevant tools to execute its policy and explore the video content; (3) Policy Communication: During the intermediate stages of policy execution, agents interact with one another to update their respective policies. Through this collaborative framework, all agents work in tandem, dynamically refining their preferred policies based on contextual insights from peers to effectively respond to the user's query. Moreover, we equip our CPP paradigm with a concise Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method. Consequently, the team of policy agents can be jointly optimized to enhance VideoChat-M1's performance, guided by both the final answer reward and intermediate collaborative process feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoChat-M1 achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks spanning four tasks. Notably, on LongVideoBench, our method outperforms the SOTA model Gemini 2.5 pro by 3.6% and GPT-4o by 15.6%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edfVideoChat-M1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u89c4\u5212\uff08CPP\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6267\u884c\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u54cd\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u591a\u6837\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u89c4\u5212\uff08CPP\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u4fe1\u4e09\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728LongVideoBench\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eGemini 2.5 pro 3.6%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-4o 15.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "VideoChat-M1\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Regression, unsupervised learning, CLIQUE importance, and RF-GAP proximity are planned for v2.0.\n  This work introduces four solutions addressing the proximity matrix memory bottleneck limiting Random Forest analysis to ~60,000 samples: (1) QLORA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) compression for GPU proximity matrices, reducing memory from 80GB to 6.4MB for 100k samples (12,500x compression with INT8 quantization) while maintaining 99% geometric structure preservation, (2) CPU TriBlock proximity--combining upper-triangle storage with block-sparse thresholding--achieving 2.7x memory reduction with lossless quality, (3) SM-aware GPU batch sizing achieving 95% GPU utilization, and (4) GPU-accelerated 3D MDS visualization computing embeddings directly from low-rank factors using power iteration.\n  Validation across four implementation modes (GPU/CPU x case-wise/non-case-wise) demonstrates correct implementation.

Preprint submitted to IEEE Vehicle Technology Magazine", "summary": "In the 6G era, semantic collaboration among multiple embodied intelligent devices (MEIDs) becomes crucial for complex task execution. However, existing systems face challenges in multimodal information fusion, adaptive communication, and decision interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a collaborative Conversational Embodied Intelligence Network (CC-EIN) integrating multimodal feature fusion, adaptive semantic communication, task coordination, and interpretability. PerceptiNet performs cross-modal fusion of image and radar data to generate unified semantic representations. An adaptive semantic communication strategy dynamically adjusts coding schemes and transmission power according to task urgency and channel quality.

This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous \"split-then-balance\" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard (\"Social Media Screener\") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e2d10\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u6b3a\u51cc\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u6311\u6218\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u6b3a\u51cc\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u7ba1\u7406\u6765\u81ea Twitter \u548c Reddit \u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u201c\u5206\u5272\u7136\u540e\u5e73\u8861\u201d\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u51e0\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u7684transformers\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u8c03\u6574\u7684 MentalBERT \u6210\u4e3a\u9876\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u5230 0.92\uff0cMacro F1 \u5206\u6570\u4e3a 0.76\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c LLM \u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4ea4\u53c9\u70b9\u5bf9\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u672a\u6765\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

While this form of reasoning is fundamental to human cognition, current vision-language benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of this ability and instead focus on surface-level recognition or image-text alignment.\n  To address this gap, we introduce Perceptual Taxonomy, a benchmark for physically grounded visual reasoning. We annotate 3173 objects with four property families covering 84 fine-grained attributes. Using these annotations, we construct a multiple-choice question benchmark with 5802 images across both synthetic and real domains. The benchmark contains 28033 template-based questions spanning four types (object description, spatial reasoning, property matching, and taxonomy reasoning), along with 50 expert-crafted questions designed to evaluate models across the full spectrum of perceptual taxonomy reasoning.\n  Experimental results show that leading vision-language models perform well on recognition tasks but degrade by 10 to 20 percent on property-driven questions, especially those requiring multi-step reasoning over structured attributes. These findings highlight a persistent gap in structured visual understanding and the limitations of current models that rely heavily on pattern matching. We also show that providing in-context reasoning examples from simulated scenes improves performance on real-world and expert-curated questions, demonstrating the effectiveness of perceptual-taxonomy-guided prompting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u201d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u7269\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u7269\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u8bc6\u522b\u6216\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u201d\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u5305\u542b\u5bf93173\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8986\u76d684\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b5802\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u548c28033\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca50\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u5404\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9886\u5148\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8610%\u523020%\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u3002\u6765\u81ea\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u793a\u4f8b\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002"}}

Among the dominant compression techniques: knowledge distillation, structured pruning, and low-bit quantization, their individual effects are well studied, but their interactions and optimal sequencing remain unclear. This work systematically examines how these techniques perform both independently and in combination when applied to the Qwen2.5 3B model. We evaluate multiple compression pipelines, including single, and proposed three-technique sequences, using perplexity, G-Eval, clarity, prompt alignment, and compression ratio as metrics. Our experiments show that quantization provides the greatest standalone compression, while pruning introduces moderate quality degradation. Critically, the ordering of techniques significantly affects the final model quality: the sequence Pruning, Knowledge Distillation, Quantization (P-KD-Q) yields the best balance, achieving a 3.68x compression ratio while preserving strong instruction-following and language understanding capabilities. Conversely, pipelines applying quantization early suffer severe performance degradation due to irreversible information loss that impairs subsequent training.

We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries. Follow-up confidence prompts yielded modest, mostly downward revisions, suggesting mild overestimation in first-pass assessments. Qualitative analysis showed that higher self-efficacy corresponded to more assertive, anthropomorphic reasoning styles, whereas lower scores reflected cautious, de-anthropomorphized explanations.

The online construction of HD maps offers a scalable approach to generate local maps from on-board sensors.

In this work, we propose MapRF, a weakly supervised framework that learns to construct 3D maps using only 2D image labels. To generate high-quality pseudo labels, we introduce a novel Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) module conditioned on map predictions, which reconstructs view-consistent 3D geometry and semantics. These pseudo labels are then iteratively used to refine the map network in a self-training manner, enabling progressive improvement without additional supervision. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation during self-training, we propose a Map-to-Ray Matching strategy that aligns map predictions with camera rays derived from 2D labels. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that MapRF achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods, attaining around 75% of the baseline while surpassing several approaches using only 2D labels. This highlights the potential of MapRF to enable scalable and cost-effective online HD map construction for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "MapRF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282D\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa3D\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u76843D\u5730\u56fe\u6807\u6ce8\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMapRF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\uff08NeRF\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u4ee5\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u6539\u8fdb\u5730\u56fe\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5730\u56fe\u5230\u5c04\u7ebf\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u5728Argoverse 2\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMapRF\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u57fa\u7ebf\u768475%\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282D\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MapRF\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings.

Vidi models continue to evolve toward next-generation video creation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal temporal retrieval (TR). In its second release, Vidi2 advances video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and extends its capability to video question answering (Video QA), enabling comprehensive multimodal reasoning. Given a text query, Vidi2 can identify not only the corresponding timestamps but also the bounding boxes of target objects within the output time ranges. This end-to-end spatio-temporal grounding capability enables potential applications in complex editing scenarios, such as plot or character understanding, automatic multi-view switching, and intelligent, composition-aware reframing and cropping. To enable comprehensive evaluation of STG in practical settings, we introduce a new benchmark, VUE-STG, which offers four key improvements over existing STG datasets: 1) Video duration: spans from roughly 10s to 30 mins, enabling long-context reasoning; 2) Query format: queries are mostly converted into noun phrases while preserving sentence-level expressiveness; 3) Annotation quality: all ground-truth time ranges and bounding boxes are manually annotated with high accuracy; 4) Evaluation metric: a refined vIoU/tIoU/vIoU-Intersection scheme. In addition, we upgrade the previous VUE-TR benchmark to VUE-TR-V2, achieving a more balanced video-length distribution and more user-style queries. Remarkably, the Vidi2 model substantially outperforms leading proprietary systems, such as Gemini 3 Pro (Preview) and GPT-5, on both VUE-TR-V2 and VUE-STG, while achieving competitive results with popular open-source models with similar scale on video QA benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Vidi2 \u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86 Gemini 3 Pro \u548c GPT-5 \u7b49\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u9700\u6c42\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u68c0\u7d22\uff08TR\uff09\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "Vidi2 \u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08STG\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\uff08Video QA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6 VUE-STG\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9 STG \u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Vidi2 \u5728 VUE-TR-V2 \u548c VUE-STG \u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e Gemini 3 Pro \u548c GPT-5 \u7b49\u9886\u5148\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0e\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Vidi2 \u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 VUE \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Exploring a better network structure for attention in TSF holds immense significance across various domains. In this paper, we present PeriodNet with a brand new structure to forecast univariate and multivariate time series. PeriodNet incorporates period attention and sparse period attention mechanism for analyzing adjacent periods. It enhances the mining of local characteristics, periodic patterns, and global dependencies. For efficient cross-variable modeling, we introduce an iterative grouping mechanism which can directly reduce the cross-variable redundancy. To fully leverage the extracted features on the encoder side, we redesign the entire architecture of the vanilla Transformer and propose a period diffuser for precise multi-period prediction. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on eight datasets, we demonstrate that PeriodNet outperforms six state-of-the-art models in both univariate and multivariate TSF scenarios in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error.

However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

However, their behavior in production environments remains poorly understood, and their failure patterns differ fundamentally from those of traditional machine learning models. This paper presents a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes that arise in real-world LLM applications, including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems.

Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff08SSA\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u751a\u81f3\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6SSA\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u8fd9\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5230\u6240\u6709token\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u9f13\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5176\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "result": "SSA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e38\u8bc6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cSSA\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u6ed1\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u9884\u7b97\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u591atoken\u53c2\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002SSA\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u89e3sink\u533a\u57df\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u503c\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u539f\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5916\u63a8\uff0c\u800cSSA\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Heritage institutions worldwide have digitized more than one million maps, and automated techniques now enable large-scale recognition and extraction of map content. Yet these methods have engaged little with the history of cartography, or the view that maps are semantic-symbolic systems, and cultural objects reflecting political and epistemic expectations. This work leverages a diverse corpus of 771,561 map records and 99,715 digitized images aggregated from 38 digital catalogs. After normalization, the dataset includes 236,925 contributors and spans six centuries, from 1492 to 1948. These data make it possible to chart geographic structures and the global chronology of map publication. The spatial focus of cartography is analyzed in relation to political dynamics, evidencing links between Atlantic maritime charting, the triangular trade, and colonial expansion. Further results document the progression of national, domestic focus and the impact of military conflicts on publication volumes. The research introduces semantic segmentation techniques and object detection models for the generic recognition of land classes and cartographic signs, trained on annotated data and synthetic images. The analysis of land classes shows that maps are designed images whose framing and composition emphasize features through centering and semantic symmetries. The study of cartographic figuration encodes 63 M signs and 25 M fragments into a latent visual space, revealing figurative shifts such as the replacement of relief hachures by terrain contours and showing that signs tend to form locally consistent systems.

These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \\textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \\textbf{Tri}archy \\textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the \"fake\" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts.

Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology.

Existing approaches to GS deformation typically rely on deformation proxies such as cages or meshes, but they suffer from dependency on proxy quality and additional computational overhead. An alternative is to directly apply Laplacian-based deformation techniques by treating splats as point clouds. However, this often fail to properly capture surface information due to lack of explicit structure. To address this, we propose a novel method that constructs a surface-aware splat graph, enabling the Laplacian operator derived from it to support more plausible deformations that preserve details and topology. Our key idea is to leverage the spatial arrangement encoded in splats, defining neighboring splats not merely by the distance between their centers, but by their intersections. Furthermore, we introduce a Gaussian kernel adaptation technique that preserves surface structure under deformation, thereby improving rendering quality after deformation. In our experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to both proxy-based and proxy-free baselines, evaluated on 50 challenging objects from the ShapeNet, Objaverse, and Sketchfab datasets, as well as the NeRF-Synthetic dataset.

We formalize this tension as the Alignment Trilemma: no RLHF system can simultaneously achieve (i) epsilon-representativeness across diverse human values, (ii) polynomial tractability in sample and compute complexity, and (iii) delta-robustness against adversarial perturbations and distribution shift. Through a complexity-theoretic analysis integrating statistical learning theory and robust optimization, we prove that achieving both representativeness (epsilon <= 0.01) and robustness (delta <= 0.001) for global-scale populations requires Omega(2^{d_context}) operations, which is super-polynomial in the context dimensionality. We show that current RLHF implementations resolve this trilemma by sacrificing representativeness: they collect only 10^3--10^4 samples from homogeneous annotator pools while 10^7--10^8 samples are needed for true global representation. Our framework provides a unified explanation for documented RLHF pathologies including preference collapse, sycophancy, and systematic bias amplification.

We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems.

However, these models often generate hallucinated outputs or produce generic responses that lack domain-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage reasoning-based framework for visual question answering (VQA) in disaster scenarios. ThiFAN-VQA first generates structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and ICL to enable interpretable reasoning under limited supervision. A subsequent answer selection module evaluates the generated responses and assigns the most coherent and contextually accurate answer, effectively improve the model performance. By integrating a custom information retrieval system, domain-specific prompting, and reasoning-guided answer selection, ThiFAN-VQA bridges the gap between zero-shot and supervised methods, combining flexibility with consistency. Experiments on FloodNet and RescueNet-VQA, UAV-based datasets from flood- and hurricane-affected regions, demonstrate that ThiFAN-VQA achieves superior accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability for real-world post-disaster damage assessment tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aThiFAN-VQA\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53ca\u65f6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u635f\u5931\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\uff08CoT\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u7b54\u6848\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u8fde\u8d2f\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728FloodNet\u548cRescueNet-VQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cThiFAN-VQA\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u707e\u540e\u635f\u5931\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ThiFAN-VQA\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u707e\u540e\u635f\u5931\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

A simplified, machine-actionable representation was developed to assess the similarity and separability of these disorders, but it is not suited for the most complex cases. Generating or applying a full binary matrix for similarity calculations is infeasible due to the vast number of symptom combinations. This research develops an alternative representation that links the narrative form of the DSM-5 with the binary matrix representation and enables automated generation of valid symptom combinations. Using a strict pre-defined format of lists, sets, and numbers with slight variations, complex diagnostic pathways involving numerous symptom combinations can be represented. This format, called the symptom profile generator (or simply generator), provides a readable, adaptable, and comprehensive alternative to a binary matrix while enabling easy generation of symptom combinations (profiles). Cognitive disorders, which typically involve multiple diagnostic criteria with several symptoms, can thus be expressed as lists of generators. Representing several psychotic disorders in generator form and generating all symptom combinations showed that matrix representations of complex disorders become too large to manage. The MPCS (maximum pairwise cosine similarity) algorithm cannot handle matrices of this size, prompting the development of a profile reduction method using targeted generator manipulation to find specific MPCS values between disorders. The generators allow easier creation of binary representations for large matrices and make it possible to calculate specific MPCS cases between complex disorders through conditional generators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u75c7\u72b6\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06DSM-5\u7684\u53d9\u8ff0\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e8c\u5143\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u3001\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6216\u5e94\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06DSM-5\u7684\u53d9\u8ff0\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e8c\u5143\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u5217\u8868\u3001\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u6570\u5b57\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u6d89\u53ca\u5927\u91cf\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8bca\u65ad\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5f62\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u79cd\u7cbe\u795e\u969c\u788d\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6240\u6709\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u540e\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u969c\u788d\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u53d8\u5f97\u592a\u5927\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u3002MPCS\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u6210\u5668\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684profile reduction\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u67e5\u627e\u75be\u75c5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5b9aMPCS\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5730\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u77e9\u9635\u521b\u5efa\u4e8c\u5143\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u75be\u75c5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5b9aMPCS\u6848\u4f8b\u3002"}}

While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC. Our experiments show that carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation significantly enhance correction quality across multiple Indic languages.

Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters.\n  HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow \"OCR expert models\" and inefficient \"General VLMs\". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks.\n  HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace. We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier. We hope this model will advance frontier research and provide a solid foundation for industrial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "HunyuanOCR: A commercial-grade, open-source, lightweight VLM for OCR tasks excelling in both perception and semantic tasks.", "motivation": "Limitations of narrow OCR expert models and inefficient General VLMs.", "method": "Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter, end-to-end architecture, data-driven and RL strategies.", "result": "Outperforms commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models, achieving SOTA results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters and securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track).", "conclusion": "HunyuanOCR is open-sourced on HuggingFace with a high-performance deployment solution, aiming to advance research and industrial applications."}}

Despite this, existing approaches frequently perform naive fusion of multimodal inputs, overlooking key challenges such as modality-specific noise, missing modalities common in real-world scenarios, and the dynamically varying importance of each modality depending on the task. These limitations lead to suboptimal performance across several benchmark tasks. In this paper, we propose a robust multimodal fusion framework, TouchFormer. Specifically, we employ a Modality-Adaptive Gating (MAG) mechanism and intra- and inter-modality attention mechanisms to adaptively integrate cross-modal features, enhancing model robustness. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Instance Embedding Regularization(CER) strategy, which significantly improves classification accuracy in fine-grained subcategory material recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing non-visual methods, the proposed TouchFormer framework achieves classification accuracy improvements of 2.48% and 6.83% on SSMC and USMC tasks, respectively. Furthermore, real-world robotic experiments validate TouchFormer's effectiveness in enabling robots to better perceive and interpret their environment, paving the way for its deployment in safety-critical applications such as emergency response and industrial automation.

Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) serves as the frontline imaging tool, yet it often fails to reveal the subtle ischemic changes present in the early, hyperacute phase.

To address this diagnostic challenge, we introduce a semi-supervised segmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately delineate early ischemic stroke regions. The proposed method employs an adversarial framework to effectively learn from a limited number of annotated NCCT scans, while simultaneously leveraging a larger pool of unlabeled scans. By employing Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, a feature matching loss and a self-training loss, the model learns to identify and delineate early infarcts, even when they are faint or their size is small.

We revisit two natural strategies for incorporating these weights: (i) embedding them into the local losses to retain a uniform weight (and thus a doubly stochastic matrix), and (ii) keeping the original losses while employing a $\u03bb$-induced row-stochastic matrix. Although prior work shows that both strategies yield the same expected descent direction for the global loss, it remains unclear whether the Euclidean-space guarantees are tight and what fundamentally differentiates their behaviors. To clarify this, we develop a weighted Hilbert-space framework $L^2(\u03bb;\\mathbb{R}^d)$ and obtain convergence rates that are strictly tighter than those from Euclidean analysis. In this geometry, the row-stochastic matrix becomes self-adjoint whereas the doubly stochastic one does not, creating additional penalty terms that amplify consensus error, thereby slowing convergence. Consequently, the difference in convergence arises not only from spectral gaps but also from these penalty terms. We then derive sufficient conditions under which the row-stochastic design converges faster even with a smaller spectral gap.

Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST 2025), Strasburg, France", "summary": "Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging via Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) generates a large number of images requiring manual screening. Deep learning-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems can assist screening, yet their performance relies on the existence of large, diverse, training medical datasets. However, the scarcity of such data, due to privacy constraints and annotation costs, hinders CDS development. Generative machine learning offers a viable solution to combat this limitation. While current Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders have been explored, they often face challenges with training stability and capturing sufficient visual diversity, especially when synthesizing abnormal findings. This work introduces a novel VAE-based methodology for medical image synthesis and presents its application for the generation of WCE images. The novel contributions of this work include a) multiscale extension of the Vector Quantized VAE model, named as Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE); b) unlike other VAE-based SDG models for WCE image generation, MSVQ-VAE is used to seamlessly introduce abnormalities into normal WCE images; c) it enables conditional generation of synthetic images, enabling the introduction of different types of abnormalities into the normal WCE images; d) it performs experiments with a variety of abnormality types, including polyps, vascular and inflammatory conditions. The utility of the generated images for CDS is assessed via image classification. Comparative experiments demonstrate that training a CDS classifier using the abnormal images generated by the proposed methodology yield comparable results with a classifier trained with only real data. The generality of the proposed methodology promises its applicability to various domains related to medical multimedia.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eVAE\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u7ebf\u80f6\u56ca\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\uff08WCE\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86CDS\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08MSVQ-VAE\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u7f1d\u5730\u5c06\u5f02\u5e38\u5f15\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u5e38\u7684WCE\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5f15\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u5e38\u7684WCE\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3CDS\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0e\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance.

Although existing unlearning methods can remove such knowledge, they fail to achieve benign forgetting because they often degrade the model's general image understanding performance. To address this, we propose the Sculpted Memory Forgetting Adapter (SMFA), which confines forgetting to targeted memory regions while preserving overall capabilities. SMFA first fine-tunes the model to replace sensitive responses with refusals, yielding a memory forgetting adapter, and then applies a retaining anchor-guided masking mechanism to prevent interference with unrelated knowledge and understanding ability. To systematically evaluate selective MLLM unlearning, we introduce S-MLLMUn Bench, the first benchmark designed to jointly assess the removal of sensitive knowledge and retention of general visual understanding.

However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aREFLEX\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5224\u51b3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6cdb\u6ee5\u5a01\u80c1\u7740\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u5224\u51b3\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5224\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5176\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\uff0c\u4ee5\u6784\u5efasteering vectors\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u5c06\u771f\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5b9e\u8d28\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6c34\u5e73\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cREFLEX\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528465\u4e2a\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0cRELFEX\u5c31\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u6ca1\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe7.57%\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5185\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u90fd\u8d77\u7740\u53cc\u91cd\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "REFLEX\u8303\u4f8b\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u5224\u51b3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5185\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u90fd\u8d77\u7740\u53cc\u91cd\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

We introduce SkillSight for power-efficient skill assessment from first-person data.

Our two-stage framework first learns to jointly model gaze and egocentric video when predicting skill level, then distills a gaze-only student model. At inference, the student model requires only gaze input, drastically reducing power consumption by eliminating continuous video processing. Experiments on three datasets spanning cooking, music, and sports establish, for the first time, the valuable role of gaze in skill understanding across diverse real-world settings.

A dominant line of work seeks robustness by learning a robust representation, often explicitly partitioning the latent space into core and spurious components; this approach can be complex, brittle, and difficult to scale. We take a different approach, instead of a robust representation, we learn a robust function. We present a simple and effective training method that renders the classifier functionally invariant to shortcut signals. Our method operates within a disentangled latent space, which is essential as it isolates spurious and core features into distinct dimensions. This separation enables the identification of candidate shortcut features by their strong correlation with the label, used as a proxy for semantic simplicity. The classifier is then desensitized to these features by injecting targeted, anisotropic latent noise during training. We analyze this as targeted Jacobian regularization, which forces the classifier to ignore spurious features and rely on more complex, core semantic signals.

First, Context Engineering applies dynamic tool pruning and persona clipping for input compression, combined with post-processing techniques such as parameter normalization and function merging. Together with manually refined prompts, this design improves tool call stability, execution reliability, and role-playing guidance. Second, in the GPU Track, we further adopt GRPO training, replacing supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning directly optimized by reward signals.

Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models.

Methods: We proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework that uses a pre-trained vision-language foundation model to encode both the reconstructed image and auxiliary information into high-level semantic features. A contrastive objective aligns the reconstructed representation with the target semantic distribution, ensuring consistency with high-level perceptual cues. The proposed objective works with various deep learning-based reconstruction methods and can flexibly incorporate semantic priors from multimodal sources. To test the effectiveness of these semantic priors, we evaluated reconstruction results guided by priors derived from either image-only or image-language auxiliary information. Results: Experiments on knee and brain datasets demonstrate that semantic priors from images preserve fine anatomical structures and achieve superior perceptual quality, as reflected in lower LPIPS values, higher Tenengrad scores, and improved scores in the reader study, compared with conventional regularization. The image-language information further expands the semantic distribution and enables high-level control over reconstruction attributes. Across all evaluations, the contrastive objective consistently guided the reconstructed features toward the desired semantic distributions while maintaining data fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework.

While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment.

However, prior studies have used either low-resolution thumbnails or random patches, which likely underestimated model performance. Here, we ask whether LMMs can be adapted to reason coherently and accurately in the evaluation of such images. In this study, we introduce Gigapixel Image Agent for Navigating Tissue (GIANT), the first framework that allows LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide images (WSIs) like a pathologist. Accompanying GIANT, we release MultiPathQA, a new benchmark, which comprises 934 WSI-level questions, encompassing five clinically-relevant tasks ranging from cancer diagnosis to open-ended reasoning. MultiPathQA also includes 128 questions, authored by two professional pathologists, requiring direct slide interpretation. Using MultiPathQA, we show that our simple agentic system substantially outperforms conventional patch- and thumbnail-based baselines, approaching or surpassing the performance of specialized models trained on millions of images. For example, on pathologist-authored questions, GPT-5 with GIANT achieves 62.5% accuracy, outperforming specialist pathology models such as TITAN (43.8%) and SlideChat (37.5%).

A Critical Framework for Policy Uses of Neuroeconomics", "comment": "Durham Economic Journal 2025", "summary": "Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, \"brain-based\" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies \"true\" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bc1\u636e\u6765\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5408\u6cd5\u5730\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u798f\u5229\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u63cf\u8ff0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5f15\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u5bb6\u957f\u5f0f\u76d1\u7ba1\u3001\u201c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8111\u201d\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u798f\u5229\u63aa\u65bd\u662f\u5408\u7406\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff1a\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u798f\u5229\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u5728actor-critic\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5c06\u4ece\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u798f\u5229\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u795e\u7ecf\u8bc1\u636e\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6620\u5c04\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u201c\u771f\u5b9e\u201d\u5229\u76ca\u4e0econtext-dependent\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u660e\u786e\u89c4\u5b9a\u548c\u634d\u536b\u4e86\u798f\u5229\u6807\u51c6\u65f6\uff0c\u624d\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u798f\u5229\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u5927\u8111\u548c\u4eba\u5de5agent\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ef7\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8868\u660e\u5185\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fd8\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u90fd\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c31\u4e0d\u80fd\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u798f\u5229\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

Nalepa"], "title": "Actionable and diverse counterfactual explanations incorporating domain knowledge and causal constraints", "comment": null, "summary": "Counterfactual explanations enhance the actionable interpretability of machine learning models by identifying the minimal changes required to achieve a desired outcome of the model. However, existing methods often ignore the complex dependencies in real-world datasets, leading to unrealistic or impractical modifications. Motivated by cybersecurity applications in the email marketing domain, we propose a method for generating Diverse, Actionable, and kNowledge-Constrained Explanations (DANCE), which incorporates feature dependencies and causal constraints to ensure plausibility and real-world feasibility of counterfactuals. Our method learns linear and nonlinear constraints from data or integrates expert-provided dependency graphs, ensuring counterfactuals are plausible and actionable. By maintaining consistency with feature relationships, the method produces explanations that align with real-world constraints. Additionally, it balances plausibility, diversity, and sparsity, effectively addressing key limitations in existing algorithms.

However, we show that high final-answer accuracy often hides unfaithful visual reasoning: models may invoke tools on irrelevant regions or ignore tool outputs entirely, yet still guess the correct answer. In this work, we first propose a faithfulness evaluation protocol that measures whether intermediate visual tool outputs (e.g., crops) actually contain the queried evidence. This reveals that recent visual agents achieve high final-answer accuracy but exhibit low rates of faithful tool-use on visual search benchmarks. We then introduce CodeV, a code-based visual agent trained with Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO). TAPO is a process-level RL framework that augments GRPO with dense rewards defined directly on visual tool inputs and outputs, rather than on chain-of-thought tokens, making supervision easier to verify and less susceptible to reward hacking. CodeV represents visual tools as executable Python code, and TAPO assigns step-wise rewards based solely on the question and tool output, encouraging both necessary and evidence-consistent tool use. In a two-stage SFT+RL pipeline, CodeV achieves competitive or superior accuracy while substantially increasing faithful tool-use rates on related visual search benchmarks. Beyond visual search, CodeV attains strong performance on a range of multimodal reasoning and math benchmarks, suggesting that explicitly supervising intermediate tool behavior is crucial for building trustworthy, agentic visual reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Agentic\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5TAPO\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684Agentic\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8c03\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u4e2d\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u5305\u542b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86CodeV\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u89c6\u89c9agent\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO)\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002TAPO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4e49\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684tokens\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCodeV\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cCodeV\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u76d1\u7763\u4e2d\u95f4\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684Agentic\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in schema matching, they suffer from hallucination and lack of up-to-date domain knowledge. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution by providing structured, verifiable knowledge. However, existing KG-augmented LLM approaches often rely on inefficient complex multi-hop queries or storage-intensive vector-based retrieval methods. This paper introduces SMoG (Schema Matching on Graph), a novel framework that leverages iterative execution of simple 1-hop SPARQL queries, inspired by successful strategies in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). SMoG enhances explainability and reliability by generating human-verifiable query paths while significantly reducing storage requirements by directly querying SPARQL endpoints. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that SMoG achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness and efficiency in KG-augmented schema matching.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSMoG\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u3002", "method": "SMoG\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6267\u884c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5355\u8df3SPARQL\u67e5\u8be2\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSMoG\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "SMoG\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u662f\u6709\u6548\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u3002"}}

However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a new task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, considering utility, impact on downstream tasks, and semantic similarity.", "motivation": "Current evaluation approaches for stemming methods are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming.", "method": "The study proposes a novel evaluation framework considering Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), Model Performance Delta (MPD), and Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD).", "result": "The proposed framework is applied to compare two stemmers for Bangla and English, revealing issues with the Bangla stemmer due to harmful over-stemming.", "conclusion": "The study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains and meaning preservation in stemming methods."}}

Operationalized as a secure, user-friendly web application, OncoVision produces structured reports with dual-confidence scoring and attention-weighted visualizations for real-time diagnostic support to improve clinician trust and facilitate medical teaching. It can be easily incorporated into the clinic, making screening available in underprivileged areas around the world, such as rural South Asia.

Existing approaches predominantly rely on parameter interpolation in weight space, which we show introduces significant distribution shift in the feature space and undermines task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose OTMF (Optimal Transport-based Masked Fusion), a novel model merging framework rooted in optimal transport theory to address the distribution shift that arises from naive parameter interpolation. Instead of directly aggregating features or weights, OTMF aligns the semantic geometry of task-specific models by discovering common masks applied to task vectors through optimal transport plans. These masks selectively extract transferable and task-agnostic components while preserving the unique structural identities of each task. To ensure scalability in real-world settings, OTMF further supports a continual fusion paradigm that incrementally integrates each new task vector without revisiting previous ones, maintaining a bounded memory footprint and enabling efficient fusion across a growing number of tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple vision and language benchmarks, and results show that OTMF achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

Two challenges, however, remain central: training generative models when no paired data exist, and evaluating stylistic text without relying only on human judgment. In this work, we present a framework for both generating and evaluating sentences in the style of 19th-century novelists. Large language models are fine-tuned with minimal, single-token prompts to produce text in the voices of authors such as Dickens, Austen, Twain, Alcott, and Melville. To assess these generative models, we employ a transformer-based detector trained on authentic sentences, using it both as a classifier and as a tool for stylistic explanation.

We found that this interleaved finetune-freeze design enables rapid convergence with minimal data after pruning.

This makes modifying such models for tasks such as pruning or unlearning constrained by this unavailability an active area of research. Existing techniques typically require gradients or ground-truth labels, rendering them infeasible in settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global reconstruction error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term Subset Fidelity. In the uncorrelated features setting, selecting individual components via their Subset Fidelity scores is optimal, which we use to propose ModHiFi, an algorithm for model modification that requires no training data or loss function access. ModHiFi-P, for structured pruning, achieves an 11% speedup over the current state of the art on ImageNet models and competitive performance on language models. ModHiFi-U, for classwise unlearning, achieves complete unlearning on CIFAR-10 without fine-tuning and demonstrates competitive performance on Swin Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aModHiFi\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u526a\u679d\u548c\u5378\u8f7d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u6280\u672f\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u68af\u5ea6\u6216\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u6216\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u7ebf\u6027\u5730\u754c\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u91cd\u5efa\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540d\u4e3aSubset Fidelity\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "ModHiFi-P\u5728ImageNet\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u5feb11%\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002ModHiFi-U\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Swin Transformers\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ModHiFi\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In a teacher-student setup, this translates into collecting a dataset of the teacher mapping -- querying the teacher -- and fitting a student to imitate such mapping. A sensible choice of queries is the dataset the teacher is trained on. But current methods fail when the teacher parameters are more numerous than the training data, because the student overfits to the queries instead of aligning its parameters to the teacher. In this work, we explore augmentation techniques to best sample the input-output mapping of a teacher network, with the goal of eliciting a rich set of representations from the teacher hidden layers. We discover that standard augmentations such as rotation, flipping, and adding noise, bring little to no improvement to the identification problem. We design new data augmentation techniques tailored to better sample the representational space of the network's hidden layers.

We recast LMI as reusing the LLM's own latent space and propose the Invariant Latent Space Hypothesis (ILSH): (1) diverse outputs from the same source prompt should preserve consistent semantics (source invariance), and (2) input<->output cyclic mappings should be self-consistent within a shared latent space (cyclic invariance). Accordingly, we present Inv^2A, which treats the LLM as an invariant decoder and learns only a lightweight inverse encoder that maps outputs to a denoised pseudo-representation. When multiple outputs are available, they are sparsely concatenated at the representation layer to increase information density. Training proceeds in two stages: contrastive alignment (source invariance) and supervised reinforcement (cyclic invariance). An optional training-free neighborhood search can refine local performance. Across 9 datasets covering user and system prompt scenarios, Inv^2A outperforms baselines by an average of 4.77% BLEU score while reducing dependence on large inverse corpora.

However, traditional clinical assessments are ill-suited for LLMs, as they presuppose human-like pragmatic pressures and probe cognitive processes not inherent to artificial architectures. We introduce the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to assess aphasic-like deficits in LLMs. The TAB comprises four subtests: Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition.

We propose a novel prototype-based method for interpretable cell counting via density map estimation. Our approach integrates a prototype layer into the density estimation network, enabling the model to learn representative visual patterns for both cells and background artifacts. The learned prototypes were evaluated through a survey of biologists, who confirmed the relevance of the visual patterns identified, further validating the interpretability of the model. By generating interpretations that highlight regions in the input image most similar to each prototype, our method offers a clear understanding of how the model identifies and counts cells. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves interpretability without compromising counting effectiveness.

Once trained, they offer fast inference and reasonably high-quality solutions for in-distribution testing instances, but they generally fall short in terms of absolute solution quality compared to classical search-based algorithms that are admittedly slower but offer optimality guarantee once search finishes.\n  We propose a novel framework that combines the inference efficiency and exploratory power of neural models with the solution quality guarantee of search-based algorithms. In particular, we use parameterized algorithms (PAs) as the search component. PAs are dedicated to identifying easy instances of generally NP-hard problems, and allow for practically efficient search by exploiting structural simplicity (of the identified easy instances). Under our framework, we use parameterized analysis to identify the structurally hard parts of a CO instance. The neural model handles the hard parts by generating advisory signals based on its data-driven understanding. The PA-based search component then integrates the advisory signals to systematically and efficiently searches through the remaining structurally easy parts. Notably, our framework is agnostic to the choice of neural model and produces strictly better solutions than neural solvers alone.\n  We examine our framework on multiple CO tasks. Empirical results show that it achieves superior solution quality, competitive with that of commercial solvers. Furthermore, by using the neural model only for exploratory advisory signals, our framework exhibits improved out-of-distribution generalization, addressing a key limitation of existing neural CO solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3 NP-hard \u56fe\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316 (CO) \u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5e0c\u671b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u7edd\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u901a\u5e38\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5 (PA) \u4f5c\u4e3a\u641c\u7d22\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b CO \u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u8f83\u96be\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5176\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u54a8\u8be2\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8f83\u96be\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e PA \u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7ec4\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u54a8\u8be2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u641c\u7d22\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u5bb9\u6613\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a CO \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0e\u5546\u4e1a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u54a8\u8be2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf CO \u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

We present NNGPT, an open-source framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, primarily for computer vision. Unlike previous frameworks, NNGPT extends the dataset of neural networks by generating new models, enabling continuous fine-tuning of LLMs based on closed-loop system of generation, assessment, and self-improvement. It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78.

Existing approaches either rely on limited segmentation training data, which hinders generalization, or apply zero-shot heuristics to vision-language models (e.g CLIP), while the most competitive approaches combine multiple models to improve performance at the cost of high computational and memory demands. In this work, we leverage an overlooked agglomerative vision foundation model, RADIO, to improve zero-shot OVSS along three key axes simultaneously: mIoU, latency, and parameter efficiency. We present the first comprehensive study of RADIO for zero-shot OVSS and enhance its performance through self-correlating recursive attention, self-correlating global aggregation, and computationally efficient mask refinement. Our approach, RADSeg, achieves 6-30% mIoU improvement in the base ViT class while being 3.95x faster and using 2.5x fewer parameters.

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world.

Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate the automatic detection of these discourse features, offering educational researchers scalable and data-driven insights.

This leaves an underexplored research question: can we reduce the number of stacked transformer layers while maintaining comparable representational capacity? To answer this, we propose a branch-based structural reparameterization technique that operates during the training phase. Our approach leverages parallel branches within transformer blocks that can be systematically consolidated into streamlined single-path models suitable for inference deployment. The consolidation mechanism works by gradually merging branches at the entry points of nonlinear components, enabling both feed-forward networks (FFN) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules to undergo exact mathematical reparameterization without inducing approximation errors at test time. When applied to ViT-Tiny, the framework successfully reduces the original 12-layer architecture to 6, 4, or as few as 3 layers while maintaining classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K. The resulting compressed models achieve inference speedups of up to 37% on mobile CPU platforms.

To this end, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the generation-evaluation consistency (GE-consistency) among various LLMs, revealing a strong correlation between their generation and evaluation capabilities when evaluated by a strong LLM preference oracle. Utilizing this finding, we propose a benchmarking paradigm that measures LLM alignment with human preferences without directly evaluating their generated outputs, instead assessing LLMs in their role as evaluators. Our evaluation shows that our proposed benchmark, AlignEval, matches or surpasses widely used automatic LLM evaluation benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, in capturing human preferences when ranking LLMs. Our study offers valuable insights into the connection between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities, and introduces a benchmark that assesses alignment without directly evaluating model outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5AlignEval\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5f3a\u5927\u7684LLM\u88c1\u5224\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76LLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u5404\u79cdLLM\u7684\u751f\u6210-\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08GE\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u7531\u5f3a\u5927\u7684LLM\u504f\u597d\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u6765\u8861\u91cfLLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5AlignEval\u5728\u6355\u83b7\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u52a8LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982AlpacaEval\u548cArena-Hard\uff09\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u4e86LLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5373\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, small objects often remain difficult to detect from high altitudes due to low object-to-background pixel ratios.

By integrating altitude-dependent scaling with an adaptive tiling factor, we reduce unnecessary computation while maintaining detection performance. Tested on the SeaDronesSee dataset [1] with YOLOv5 [2] and Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) framework [3], our approach improves Mean Average Precision (mAP) for small objects by 38% compared to a baseline and achieves more than double the inference speed compared to static tiling.

In the deterministic case, we prove that any first-order zero-respecting algorithm requires at least $\u03a9(\u03ba^{3/2}\u03b5^{-2})$ oracle calls to find an $\u03b5$-accurate stationary point, improving the optimal lower bounds known for single-level nonconvex optimization and for nonconvex-strongly-convex min-max problems.

Beginning with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique, numerous reasoning methods have emerged that decompose problems into smaller, sequential steps (or thoughts). However, existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving and do not necessarily generate creative solutions by ``creative reasoning''. In domains where the solution space is expansive and conventional solutions are suboptimal, such as drug discovery or business strategization, creative reasoning to discover innovative solutions is crucial. To address this gap, first we introduce a computational framework for creative reasoning inspired by established cognitive science principles. With this framework, we propose three core creative reasoning paradigms, namely, \\textit{combinational}, \\textit{exploratory}, and \\textit{transformative} reasoning, where each offers specific directions for systematic exploration of the universe of thoughts to generate creative solutions. Next, to materialize this framework using LLMs, we introduce the \\textit{Universe of Thoughts} (or \\textit{UoT}, for short), a novel set of methods to implement the aforementioned three creative processes. Finally, we introduce three novel tasks that necessitate creative problem-solving, along with an evaluation benchmark to assess creativity from three orthogonal perspectives: feasibility as constraint, and utility and novelty as metrics. With a comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning techniques as well as representative commercial models with reasoning capability, we show that UoT demonstrates superior performance in creative reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7740\u773c\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u201c\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u201d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684 UoT \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6fc0\u53d1 LLM \u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u521b\u9020\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e7f\u9614\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6b20\u4f73\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u6216\u5546\u4e1a\u6218\u7565\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u3002 2. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u5f0f\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u3002 3. \u5f15\u5165\u4e86 Universe of Thoughts (UoT) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5229\u7528 LLM \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u8ff0\u4e09\u79cd\u521b\u9020\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "UoT \u5728\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UoT \u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347 LLM \u5728\u9700\u8981\u521b\u9020\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference.

The computation cost of OT, however, hinders its scalability. Slice-based transport plans have recently shown promise for reducing the computational cost by leveraging the closed-form solutions of 1D OT problems. These methods optimize a one-dimensional projection (slice) to obtain a conditional transport plan that minimizes the transport cost in the ambient space. While efficient, these methods leave open the question of whether learned optimal slicers can transfer to new distribution pairs under distributional shift. Understanding this transferability is crucial in settings with evolving data or repeated OT computations across closely related distributions. In this paper, we study the min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP) framework and investigate the transferability of optimized slicers: can a slicer trained on one distribution pair yield effective transport plans for new, unseen pairs? Theoretically, we show that optimized slicers remain close under slight perturbations of the data distributions, enabling efficient transfer across related tasks. To further improve scalability, we introduce a minibatch formulation of min-STP and provide statistical guarantees on its accuracy.

The approach incorporates a learnable Gaussian Process module that generates smooth, correlated perturbations, encouraging the forecasting backbone to capture long-range structure while a dedicated refinement model restores high-resolution temporal detail. Training the components jointly enables natural competence division and avoids the artifacts commonly produced by isotropic corruption methods. Experiments across electricity, traffic, and solar datasets show consistent gains in multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The modular design also allows the blur-denoise layer to operate as a lightweight enhancement for pretrained models, supporting efficient adaptation in limited-data scenarios.

However, synthetic traffic is not inherently privacy-preserving, and the extent to which it leaks sensitive information, and how to measure such leakage, remain largely unexplored. This challenge is further compounded by the diversity of model architectures, which shape how traffic is represented and synthesized. We introduce a comprehensive set of privacy metrics for synthetic network traffic, combining standard approaches like membership inference attacks (MIA) and data extraction attacks with network-specific identifiers and attributes. Using these metrics, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of different representative generative models and examine the factors that influence attack success. Our results reveal substantial variability in privacy risks across models and datasets.

Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts.

While fragment-based models handle limited data better than atom-based approaches, existing heuristic fragmentation limits diversity and misses key fragments. Additionally, model tuning typically requires slow, indirect collaboration between medicinal chemists and AI engineers. We introduce FRAGMENTA, an end-to-end framework for drug lead optimization comprising: 1) a novel generative model that reframes fragmentation as a \"vocabulary selection\" problem, using dynamic Q-learning to jointly optimize fragmentation and generation; and 2) an agentic AI system that refines objectives via conversational feedback from domain experts.

Multimodal neural networks have seen increasing use for identifying species to help automate this task, but they have two major drawbacks. First, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of their decision making process. Second, collecting genetic data is often expensive and requires invasive procedures, often necessitating researchers to capture or kill the target specimen. We address both of these problems by extending prototype networks (ProtoPNets), which are a popular and interpretable alternative to traditional neural networks, to the multimodal, cost-aware setting. We ensemble prototypes from each modality, using an associated weight to determine how much a given prediction relies on each modality. We further introduce methods to identify cases for which we do not need the expensive genetic information to make confident predictions. We demonstrate that our approach can intelligently allocate expensive genetic data for fine-grained distinctions while using abundant image data for clearer visual classifications and achieving comparable accuracy to models that consistently use both modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u539f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc (ProtoPNets) \u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7269\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9ed1\u76d2\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u6570\u636e\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7269\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ed1\u76d2\u6027\u8d28\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u9057\u4f20\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u6765\u81ea\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u9057\u4f20\u4fe1\u606f\u4e5f\u80fd\u505a\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u533a\u5206\u65f6\u667a\u80fd\u5730\u5206\u914d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules.

Meanwhile, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization and few-shot capabilities across diverse visual domains. In this work, we integrate VLM-based segmentation into semi-supervised medical image segmentation by introducing a Vision-Language Enhanced Semi-supervised Segmentation Assistant (VESSA) that incorporates foundation-level visual-semantic understanding into SSL frameworks. Our approach consists of two stages. In Stage 1, the VLM-enhanced segmentation foundation model VESSA is trained as a reference-guided segmentation assistant using a template bank containing gold-standard exemplars, simulating learning from limited labeled data. Given an input-template pair, VESSA performs visual feature matching to extract representative semantic and spatial cues from exemplar segmentations, generating structured prompts for a SAM2-inspired mask decoder to produce segmentation masks. In Stage 2, VESSA is integrated into a state-of-the-art SSL framework, enabling dynamic interaction with the student model: as student predictions become more refined, they are fed back to VESSA as prompts, allowing it to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels and stronger guidance. Extensive experiments across multiple segmentation datasets and domains show that VESSA-augmented SSL significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines under extremely limited annotation conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aVESSA\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u589e\u5f3a\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u5230\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bad\u7ec3VLM\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bVESSA\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5272\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u5e93\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u30022. \u5c06VESSA\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684SSL\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1a\u968f\u7740\u5b66\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u7cbe\u786e\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u88ab\u53cd\u9988\u7ed9VESSA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5b83\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVESSA\u589e\u5f3a\u7684SSL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "VESSA\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u5230\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

However, prior work on large-scale time series models has predominantly focused on forecasting, leaving a critical gap for versatile, fine-tuning-free classification. To address this, we introduce TiCT (Time-series in-Context Transformer), a transformer-based model pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data to perform in-context classification. We make two primary technical contributions: 1) a novel architecture featuring a scalable bit-based label encoding and a special output attention mechanism to handle an arbitrary number of classes; and 2) a synthetic pre-training framework that combines a Mixup-inspired process with data augmentation to foster generalization and noise invariance. Extensive evaluations on the UCR Archive show that TiCT achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art supervised methods.

This study proposes a new feature, relative angle, computed as the angle between the normal vector of a point and the average normal vector of its parent point cloud. This single-dimensional feature provides directionality information equivalent to normal vectors for concrete surface defect characteristics. Through entropy-based feature evaluation, this study demonstrates the ability of relative angle to filter out redundant information in undamaged sections while retaining effective information in damaged sections. By training and testing with PointNet++, models based on the relative angles achieved similar performance to that of models based on normal vectors while delivering 27.6% storage reduction and 83% input channel compression.

However, this often introduces large errors due to outliers in the weights. Proposed mitigation mechanisms include applying adaptive rounding, random rotation transformations or committing to a post-training target using calibration data. Unfortunately, this reliance on calibration data can be severely limiting in some real-world scenarios as such data may be unavailable or subject to privacy regulations. In this paper, we propose algorithms to optimize transformations and adaptive rounding without access to any calibration data. The optimization is achieved by designing a suitable proxy function for the quantization loss without calibration data. To maintain inference efficiency, we perform structured matrix transformations for single matrices. For paired weights that interact directly in the computation graph, we use dual matrix transformations and adaptive rounding methods. We conduct experiments on Gemma 2 models, and observe consistent improvement over the baselines. For Gemma 2 9B quantization, our method improves the average benchmark score from 61.9 to 62.4 for 4-bit quantization and from 52.0 to 60.6 for 3-bit quantization, while adding less than 3% of computation overhead.

Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture uncertainty or the reliability of model predictions, particularly under adversarial or degraded conditions. This paper introduces the \\emph{Parallel Trust Assessment System (PaTAS)}, a framework for modeling and propagating trust in neural networks using Subjective Logic (SL). PaTAS operates in parallel with standard neural computation through \\emph{Trust Nodes} and \\emph{Trust Functions} that propagate input, parameter, and activation trust across the network. The framework defines a \\emph{Parameter Trust Update} mechanism to refine parameter reliability during training and an \\emph{Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA)} method to compute instance-specific trust at inference. Experiments on real-world and adversarial datasets demonstrate that PaTAS produces interpretable, symmetric, and convergent trust estimates that complement accuracy and expose reliability gaps in poisoned, biased, or uncertain data scenarios.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven autonomous discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08LLM-AL\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6b21\u6570\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u9650\u5236\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5176\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u901a\u7528token\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684few-shot\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cdprompt\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6587\u672c\u3002\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "LLM-AL\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u5019\u9009\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1170%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002LLM-AL\u6267\u884c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u66f4\u5177\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7684\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u72b6\u6001\u3002LLM-AL\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM-AL\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edfAL\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution. At the same time, the prompt-level space provides a global semantic constraint that regulates distribution shifts, preventing quality degradation while maintaining high fidelity. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show that TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points, without sacrificing image quality.

We propose Prune-Then-Plan, a simple and effective framework that stabilizes exploration through step-level calibration. Instead of trusting raw VLM scores, our method prunes implausible frontier choices using a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure and then delegates final decisions to a coverage-based planner. This separation converts overconfident predictions into conservative, interpretable actions by relying on human-level judgments to calibrate the step-level behavior of VLMs. Integrated into the 3D-Mem EQA framework, our approach achieves relative improvements of up to 49% and 33% in visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match metrics respectively over baselines.

When tokens from different spatial grids are mixed, the attention mechanism collapses. The issue is structural. Linear coordinate remapping forces a single attention head to compare RoPE phases sampled at incompatible rates, creating phase aliasing that destabilizes the score landscape. Pretrained DiTs are especially brittle-many heads exhibit extremely sharp, periodic phase selectivity-so even tiny cross-rate inconsistencies reliably cause blur, artifacts, or full collapse.\n  To this end, our main contribution is Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA), a training-free drop-in fix that eliminates this failure at its source. CRPA modifies only the RoPE index map for each attention call: all Q/K positions are expressed on the query's stride so that equal physical distances always induce identical phase increments. This restores the precise phase patterns that DiTs rely on. CRPA is fully compatible with pretrained DiTs, stabilizes all heads and layers uniformly.

These gains are highly sensitive to random seeds, data ordering, and implementation details, yet are rarely accompanied by uncertainty estimates or significance tests. It is therefore unclear when a reported +1-2% reflects a real algorithmic advance versus noise.\n  We revisit this problem under realistic compute budgets, where only a few runs are affordable. We propose a simple, PC-friendly evaluation protocol based on paired multi-seed runs, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals, and a sign-flip permutation test on per-seed deltas. The protocol is intentionally conservative and is meant as a guardrail against over-claiming.\n  We instantiate it on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10N, and AG News using synthetic no-improvement, small-gain, and medium-gain scenarios. Single runs and unpaired t-tests often suggest significant gains for 0.6-2.0 point improvements, especially on text. With only three seeds, our paired protocol never declares significance in these settings.

We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%).

For example, OCR errors like misreading \"50 mph\" as \"60 mph\" could cause severe traffic accidents. This leads us to ask: Can VLMs know when they can't see? Existing abstention methods suggest pessimistic answers: they either rely on miscalibrated output probabilities or require semantic agreement unsuitable for OCR tasks. However, this failure may indicate we are looking in the wrong place: uncertainty signals could be hidden in VLMs' internal representations.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Latent Representation Probing (LRP): training lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns. We explore three probe designs: concatenating representations across all layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling single layer probes by majority vote. Experiments on four benchmarks across image and video modalities show LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6\\% over best baselines. Our analysis reveals: probes generalize across various uncertainty sources and datasets, and optimal signals emerge from intermediate rather than final layers. This establishes a principled framework for building deployment-ready AI systems by detecting confidence signals from internal states rather than unreliable outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5728\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff08STVQA\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u907f\u514d\u56de\u7b54\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (VLM) \u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54 (STVQA) \u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u9002\u5408 OCR \u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u53bb\u5bfb\u627e\u9690\u85cf\u5728 VLM \u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u63a2\u6d4b (LRP)\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u8de8\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u8fde\u63a5\u8868\u793a\u3001\u805a\u5408\u89c6\u89c9token\u4e0a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u96c6\u6210\u5355\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLRP \u5c06\u5f03\u6743\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 7.6%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6700\u4f73\u4fe1\u53f7\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684 AI \u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, their capability for counterfactual reasoning, inferring alternative outcomes under hypothetical conditions, remains underexplored. This capability is essential for robust video understanding, as it requires identifying underlying causal structures and reasoning about unobserved possibilities, rather than merely recognizing observed patterns. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels.

Work in progress", "summary": "Data attribution seeks to trace model behavior back to the training examples that shaped it, enabling debugging, auditing, and data valuation at scale. Classical influence-function methods offer a principled foundation but remain impractical for modern networks because they require expensive backpropagation or Hessian inversion at inference. We propose a data attribution method that preserves the same first-order counterfactual target while eliminating per-query backward passes. Our approach simulates each training example's parameter influence through short-horizon gradient propagation during training and later reads out attributions for any query using only forward evaluations. This design shifts computation from inference to simulation, reflecting real deployment regimes where a model may serve billions of user queries but originate from a fixed, finite set of data sources (for example, a large language model trained on diverse corpora while compensating a specific publisher such as the New York Times). Empirically, on standard MLP benchmarks, our estimator matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines such as TRAK on standard attribution metrics (LOO and LDS) while offering orders-of-magnitude lower inference cost. By combining influence-function fidelity with first-order scalability, our method provides a theoretical framework for practical, real-time data attribution in large pretrained models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u77ed\u65f6\u68af\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u8bfb\u51fa\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230\u5851\u9020\u5b83\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u8bd5\u3001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u503c\u3002\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u8bf4\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6216 Hessian \u77e9\u9635\u6c42\u9006\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u77ed\u65f6\u68af\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u8bfb\u51fa\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6 MLP \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5f52\u56e0\u6307\u6807\uff08LOO \u548c LDS\uff09\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u5982 TRAK\uff09\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e00\u9636\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While all tested models were susceptible to emergent misalignment, some models showed more resistance than others. Specifically the Qwen-2.5 family proved to be relatively resistant, while GPT-4o exhibited the strongest misalignment. In this paper we evaluate if current-generation open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to the Qwen-2.5 family and measure misalignment robustness over a range of model architectures and scales.\n  We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters). Models fine-tuned on insecure code generation show a 0.68% misalignment rate (compared to 0.07% for base models), matching the lower end of prior open-model results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%.\n  We identify a critical format-dependent vulnerability: requiring JSON output doubles misalignment rates compared to natural language prompts (0.96% vs 0.42%).

Existing mechanistic interpretability methods typically treat attention heads and multilayer perceptron layers (MLPs) (the building blocks of a transformer architecture) as indivisible units, overlooking possibilities of functional substructure learned within them. In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces. While some directions remain challenging to interpret fully, our results highlight that transformer computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than previously assumed.

However, their practical deployment is severely hampered by substantial static memory overhead, as all experts must be loaded into memory. Existing post-training pruning methods, while reducing model size, often derive their pruning criteria from a single, general-purpose corpus. This leads to a critical limitation: a catastrophic performance degradation when the pruned model is applied to other domains, necessitating a costly re-pruning for each new domain. To address this generalization gap, we introduce Mosaic Pruning (MoP). The core idea of MoP is to construct a functionally comprehensive set of experts through a structured ``cluster-then-select\" process. This process leverages a similarity metric that captures expert performance across different task domains to functionally cluster the experts, and subsequently selects the most representative expert from each cluster based on our proposed Activation Variability Score. Unlike methods that optimize for a single corpus, our proposed Mosaic Pruning ensures that the pruned model retains a functionally complementary set of experts, much like the tiles of a mosaic that together form a complete picture of the original model's capabilities, enabling it to handle diverse downstream tasks.Extensive experiments on various MoE models demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality.

Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates.

Unlike traditional 2D visual generation, World Models aim to construct realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds from images, videos, or text. These models not only need to produce high-fidelity visual content but also maintain coherence across space, time, physics, and instruction control, enabling applications in virtual reality, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and content creation. However, prior benchmarks emphasize different evaluation dimensions and lack a unified assessment of world-realism capability. To systematically evaluate World Models, we introduce the 4DWorldBench, which measures models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency. The benchmark covers tasks such as Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D. Beyond these, we innovatively introduce adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, which not only integrates but also extends traditional evaluation paradigms. To accommodate different modality-conditioned inputs, we map all modality conditions into a unified textual space during evaluation, and further integrate LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based methods. This unified and adaptive design enables more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence. Preliminary human studies further demonstrate that our adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments. We hope this benchmark will serve as a foundation for objective comparisons and improvements, accelerating the transition from \"visual generation\" to \"world generation.\" Our project can be found at https://yeppp27.github.io/4DWorldBench.github.io/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e864DWorldBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u30014D\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c4D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e16\u754c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6620\u5c04\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u4e86LLM\u3001MLLM\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3b\u89c2\u5224\u65ad\u66f4\u543b\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u5ba2\u89c2\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4ece\u201c\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u201d\u5230\u201c\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u201d\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002"}}

Finetuning and benchmarking these generative models have often relied on datasets of human-annotated design preferences. Yet, due to the subjective and highly personalized nature of visual design, preference varies widely among individuals. In this paper, we study this problem by introducing DesignPref, a dataset of 12k pairwise comparisons of UI design generation annotated by 20 professional designers with multi-level preference ratings. We found that among trained designers, substantial levels of disagreement exist (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25 for binary preferences). Natural language rationales provided by these designers indicate that disagreements stem from differing perceptions of various design aspect importance and individual preferences. With DesignPref, we demonstrate that traditional majority-voting methods for training aggregated judge models often do not accurately reflect individual preferences. To address this challenge, we investigate multiple personalization strategies, particularly fine-tuning or incorporating designer-specific annotations into RAG pipelines. Our results show that personalized models consistently outperform aggregated baseline models in predicting individual designers' preferences, even when using 20 times fewer examples.

However, fine-tuned models suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We create models that perform four tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high- and low-quality images, and person recognition from whole-body images) in a single embedding space -- without incurring substantial catastrophic forgetting. To accomplish this, we introduce two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC): a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes a foundation backbone simultaneously on all four tasks. The IMIC method proved effective with three foundation model bases: DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02. Two of these (EVA-02 and CLIP) performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans at multi-tasking across face, body, and object datasets. Further, we demonstrate that our approach does not substantially harm out-of-distribution generalization, thus maintaining a key property of foundation models. Analysis of the most accurate model variants (EVA-02 + IMIC A and B) showed linearly separable representations of the four tasks in the unified embedding space, but with substantial sharing of features across tasks. Fewer than 100 PCs calculated from any one task could perform all other tasks with nearly zero performance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIMIC\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdIMIC\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u7684\u4ea4\u9519\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u540c\u65f6\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "IMIC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728DINOv3\u3001CLIP\u548cEVA-02\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u3002EVA-02\u548cCLIP\u5728\u6240\u6709\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8de8\u4eba\u8138\u3001\u8eab\u4f53\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5bb3\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cIMIC\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002"}}

We present SX-GeoTree, a self-explaining geospatial regression tree that integrates three coupled objectives during recursive splitting: impurity reduction (MSE), spatial residual control (global Moran's I), and explanation robustness via modularity maximization on a consensus similarity network formed from (a) geographically weighted regression (GWR) coefficient distances (stimulus-response similarity) and (b) SHAP attribution distances (explanatory similarity). We recast local Lipschitz continuity of feature attributions as a network community preservation problem, enabling scalable enforcement of spatially coherent explanations without per-sample neighborhood searches. Experiments on two exemplar tasks (county-level GDP in Fujian, n=83; point-wise housing prices in Seattle, n=21,613) show SX-GeoTree maintains competitive predictive accuracy (within 0.01 $R^{2}$ of decision trees) while improving residual spatial evenness and doubling attribution consensus (modularity: Fujian 0.19 vs 0.09; Seattle 0.10 vs 0.05). Ablation confirms Moran's I and modularity terms are complementary; removing either degrades both spatial residual structure and explanation stability. The framework demonstrates how spatial similarity - extended beyond geometric proximity through GWR-derived local relationships - can be embedded in interpretable models, advancing trustworthy geospatial machine learning and offering a transferable template for domain-aware explainability.", "AI": {"tldr": "SX-GeoTree\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u56de\u5f52\u6811\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u88c2\u671f\u95f4\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u6742\u8d28\u51cf\u5c11\uff08MSE\uff09\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b8b\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\uff08\u5168\u5c40Moran's I\uff09\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6700\u5927\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5728\u8868\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u4ea7\u751f\u5c40\u90e8\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u9c81\u68d2\uff09\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "SX-GeoTree\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4ece\u5730\u7406\u52a0\u6743\u56de\u5f52\uff08GWR\uff09\u7cfb\u6570\u8ddd\u79bb\u548cSHAP\u5f52\u56e0\u8ddd\u79bb\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u5c40\u90e8Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u91cd\u94f8\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u793e\u533a\u4fdd\u7559\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u6bcf\u6b21\u6837\u672c\u90bb\u57df\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u798f\u5efa\u53bf\u7ea7GDP\uff08n=83\uff09\u548c\u897f\u96c5\u56fe\u70b9\u72b6\u623f\u4ef7\uff08n=21,613\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSX-GeoTree\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u76840.01 $R^{2}$\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6b8b\u5dee\u7a7a\u95f4\u5747\u5300\u6027\u5e76\u5c06\u5f52\u56e0\u5171\u8bc6\u7ffb\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff08\u901a\u8fc7GWR\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5173\u7cfb\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u51e0\u4f55\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u4e4b\u5916\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u8fdb\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u3002"}}
