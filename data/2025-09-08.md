Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个中文保险领域的综合基准 INSEva，用于评估人工智能系统在保险知识和能力方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准通常无法捕捉保险领域的独特特征和要求。

Method: 构建了一个多维评估分类，涵盖业务领域、任务形式、难度级别和认知知识维度，包含来自权威材料的 38,704 个高质量评估示例，并实施了定制的评估方法，用于评估开放式响应中的忠实度和完整性。

Result: 对 8 个最先进的 LLM 进行了广泛的评估，发现不同维度之间存在显着的性能差异。通用 LLM 在处理复杂、真实的保险场景方面仍然存在 существенные 的差距。

Conclusion: INSEva 弥补了现有基准的不足，为评估人工智能在保险领域的应用提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Insurance, as a critical component of the global financial system, demands
high standards of accuracy and reliability in AI applications. While existing
benchmarks evaluate AI capabilities across various domains, they often fail to
capture the unique characteristics and requirements of the insurance domain. To
address this gap, we present INSEva, a comprehensive Chinese benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating AI systems' knowledge and capabilities in
insurance. INSEva features a multi-dimensional evaluation taxonomy covering
business areas, task formats, difficulty levels, and cognitive-knowledge
dimension, comprising 38,704 high-quality evaluation examples sourced from
authoritative materials. Our benchmark implements tailored evaluation methods
for assessing both faithfulness and completeness in open-ended responses.
Through extensive evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art Large Language Models
(LLMs), we identify significant performance variations across different
dimensions. While general LLMs demonstrate basic insurance domain competency
with average scores above 80, substantial gaps remain in handling complex,
real-world insurance scenarios. The benchmark will be public soon.

### [2] [KERAG: Knowledge-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Advanced Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04716)
*Yushi Sun,Kai Sun,Yifan Ethan Xu,Xiao Yang,Xin Luna Dong,Nan Tang,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KERAG通过检索更广泛的子图来增强QA覆盖率，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱问答（KGQA）方法依赖于语义解析，由于严格的模式要求和语义模糊性，覆盖率较低。

Method: KERAG是一种新的基于KG的RAG流程，它通过检索-过滤-总结方法，并结合微调的LLM进行知识子图的Chain-of-Thought推理，从而减少噪声并改进QA。

Result: KERAG在质量上超过了最先进的解决方案约7%，超过了GPT-4o（Tool）10-21%。

Conclusion: KERAG通过检索更广泛的子图来增强QA覆盖率，并在实验中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external data, with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) offering crucial information for question answering. Traditional
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods rely on semantic parsing,
which typically retrieves knowledge strictly necessary for answer generation,
thus often suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and
semantic ambiguity. We present KERAG, a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that
enhances QA coverage by retrieving a broader subgraph likely to contain
relevant information. Our retrieval-filtering-summarization approach, combined
with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs,
reduces noises and improves QA for both simple and complex questions.
Experiments demonstrate that KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by
about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21%.

### [3] [Mentalic Net: Development of RAG-based Conversational AI and Evaluation Framework for Mental Health Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04456)
*Anandi Dutta,Shivani Mruthyunjaya,Jessica Saddington,Kazi Sifatul Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一款心理健康支持聊天机器人，旨在辅助专业医疗保健，并强调安全和有意义的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现带来了无限的可能性，但也带来了严峻的挑战。为了应对这些挑战，我们开发了这款聊天机器人。

Method: 我们采用了检索增强生成（RAG）框架，整合了提示工程，并在新数据集上对预训练模型进行了微调。同时，我们对准确性、共情、可信度、隐私和偏见进行了严格评估。

Result: 最终的系统Mentalic Net Conversational AI的BERT评分为0.898，其他评估指标也达到了令人满意的范围。

Conclusion: 我们提倡在开发这种变革性技术时采用人机协作方法和长期的负责任策略，认识到它们改变生活的潜力以及如果管理不当可能带来的风险。

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked boundless
possibilities, along with significant challenges. In response, we developed a
mental health support chatbot designed to augment professional healthcare, with
a strong emphasis on safe and meaningful application. Our approach involved
rigorous evaluation, covering accuracy, empathy, trustworthiness, privacy, and
bias. We employed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, integrated
prompt engineering, and fine-tuned a pre-trained model on novel datasets. The
resulting system, Mentalic Net Conversational AI, achieved a BERT Score of
0.898, with other evaluation metrics falling within satisfactory ranges. We
advocate for a human-in-the-loop approach and a long-term, responsible strategy
in developing such transformative technologies, recognizing both their
potential to change lives and the risks they may pose if not carefully managed.

### [4] [Optimizing Small Transformer-Based Language Models for Multi-Label Sentiment Analysis in Short Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04982)
*Julius Neumann,Robert Lange,Yuni Susanti,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了小型Transformer模型在短文本多标签情感分类中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短文本情感分类面临类别不平衡、训练样本有限和情感标签主观性等挑战，这些问题因短文本中有限的上下文而加剧，从而难以消除歧义并加剧数据稀疏性，阻碍了有效的学习。

Method: 本文评估了影响模型性能的三个关键因素：(1)持续的领域特定预训练，(2)使用自动生成的示例进行数据增强，特别是生成数据增强，以及(3)分类头的架构变体。

Result: 实验结果表明，数据增强提高了分类性能，而对增强数据集的持续预训练会引入噪声，而不是提高准确性。此外，对分类头的修改仅产生边际效益。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在资源受限的环境中优化基于BERT的模型以及改进短文本数据集中的情感分类策略提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Sentiment classification in short text datasets faces significant challenges
such as class imbalance, limited training samples, and the inherent
subjectivity of sentiment labels -- issues that are further intensified by the
limited context in short texts. These factors make it difficult to resolve
ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this
paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e.,
BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label
sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings.
Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1)
continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using
automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation,
and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment
results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while
continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than
boost accuracy. Furthermore, we confirm that modifications to the
classification head yield only marginal benefits. These findings provide
practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained
settings and refining strategies for sentiment classification in short-text
datasets.

### [5] [Evaluating NL2SQL via SQL2NL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04657)
*Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh,Afshin Oroojlooyjadid,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模式对齐释义框架，用于评估 NL2SQL 模型在语言变异下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少以系统或受控的方式解决语言变异问题。为了更好地理解 NL2SQL 模型的泛化能力，本文着重关注语言变异下的模型鲁棒性评估。

Method: 该框架利用 SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) 自动生成语义等价、词汇多样的查询，同时保持与原始模式和意图的一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有模型在语言变异下表现出脆弱性。例如，LLaMa3.3-70B 在释义后的 Spider 查询上，执行准确率下降了 10.23%。

Conclusion: 本文强调需要明确衡量语言泛化的评估框架，以确保模型在实际环境中的可靠性能。

Abstract: Robust evaluation in the presence of linguistic variation is key to
understanding the generalization capabilities of Natural Language to SQL
(NL2SQL) models, yet existing benchmarks rarely address this factor in a
systematic or controlled manner. We propose a novel schema-aligned paraphrasing
framework that leverages SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) to automatically generate
semantically equivalent, lexically diverse queries while maintaining alignment
with the original schema and intent. This enables the first targeted evaluation
of NL2SQL robustness to linguistic variation in isolation-distinct from prior
work that primarily investigates ambiguity or schema perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are far more brittle than
standard benchmarks suggest. For example, LLaMa3.3-70B exhibits a 10.23% drop
in execution accuracy (from 77.11% to 66.9%) on paraphrased Spider queries,
while LLaMa3.1-8B suffers an even larger drop of nearly 20% (from 62.9% to
42.5%). Smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) are disproportionately affected. We
also find that robustness degradation varies significantly with query
complexity, dataset, and domain -- highlighting the need for evaluation
frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable
performance in real-world settings.

### [6] [Do MLLMs Really Understand the Charts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04457)
*Xiao Zhang,Dongyuan Li,Liuyu Xiang,Yao Zhang,Cheng Zhong,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLMs在图表理解方面表现出令人印象深刻的性能，但在处理未标注图表时会出现幻觉和性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数MLLM在处理未标注图表时会出现幻觉和性能下降，为了判断MLLM是否真正理解图表。

Method: 建立了一个综合图表推理基准CRBench来评估MLLM在未标注图表上的视觉推理能力，并提出了ChartReasoner。

Result: ChartReasnoner-3B/7B在图表推理方面表现出卓越的性能，甚至优于GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash。

Conclusion: ChartReasnoner展示了在一般图表理解中的视觉推理能力，从而显著提高了性能，并使MLLM能够理性地理解图表。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them
exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when
handling non-annotated charts. Therefore, a question arises: Do MLLMs really
understand the charts? Since a human is capable of understanding charts and
estimating the values by visual reasoning, we first carefully establish a
comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to rigorously evaluate the
visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs on non-annotated charts. We argue that
MLLMs are primarily relying on recognition rather than reasoning to interpret
the charts. To steer MLLMs to reasonable chart understanding, we propose
ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding their estimation in chart
understanding. Extensive results on the proposed CRBench show that
ChartReasnoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning, even
compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. More importantly, ChartReasnoner also
demonstrates the visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension on
public benchmarks, leading to significant performance gains and enabling MLLMs
to rationally understand the charts. The code and dataset will be publicly
available upon publication.

*Daniel B. Hier,Steven Keith Platt,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在生物医学自然语言处理任务中表现良好，但在将本体术语链接到正确的标识符方面可能会失败。我们研究了为什么会发生这些失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在将本体术语链接到正确的标识符时失败的原因。

Method: 通过分析GPT-4o和LLaMa 3.1 405B在人类表型本体和基因本体两个主要本体上的预测，并评估与术语熟悉度、标识符使用、形态和本体结构相关的九个候选特征。

Result: 单变量和多变量分析表明，接触本体标识符是链接成功的最强预测指标。

Conclusion: 本体标识符的接触是链接成功的最强预测指标。

Abstract: Large language models often perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but may fail
to link ontology terms to their correct identifiers. We investigate why these
failures occur by analyzing predictions across two major ontologies, Human
Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology, and two high-performing models, GPT-4o
and LLaMa 3.1 405B. We evaluate nine candidate features related to term
familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure. Univariate
and multivariate analyses show that exposure to ontology identifiers is the
strongest predictor of linking success.

### [8] [Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System of Large and Small Models for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04459)
*Shiqin Han,Manning Gao,Menghua Jiang,Yuncheng Jiang,Haifeng Hu,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知协作系统 (U-ACS)，该系统协同编排一个强大的 MLLM 和一个轻量级基线模型，用于多模态情感分析，从而在保持 MLLM 高精度的同时，显著降低了推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 计算需求大和小型专用模型性能不佳之间的矛盾。

Method: 提出了一种不确定性驱动的级联机制，其中高效的小型模型首先充当所有输入样本的快速过滤器。只有那些产生高预测不确定性的样本才会被选择性地升级到 MLLM 以进行更复杂的分析。此外，该系统还引入了先进的策略来处理模糊或冲突的预测，包括对相似极性的预测进行加权平均，以及在两个模型都表现出高度不确定性时，使用基于提示的交叉验证来解决冲突的预测。

Result: 在基准数据集上进行的大量实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，同时与使用独立的 MLLM 相比，只需要一小部分的计算资源。

Conclusion: 该方法允许动态分配计算资源，从而在保持 MLLM 高精度的同时，大幅降低推理成本。

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly
advanced the state-of-the-art in multimodal machine learning, yet their
substantial computational demands present a critical barrier to real-world
deployment. Conversely, smaller, specialized models offer high efficiency but
often at the cost of performance. To reconcile this performance-efficiency
trade-off, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS)
that synergistically orchestrates a powerful MLLM (e.g., HumanOmni) and a
lightweight baseline model for multimodal sentiment analysis. The core of our
system is an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the efficient small
model first acts as a rapid filter for all input samples. Only those samples
yielding high predictive uncertainty, thereby indicating greater difficulty,
are selectively escalated to the MLLM for more sophisticated analysis.
Furthermore, our system introduces advanced strategies to handle ambiguous or
conflicting predictions, including weighted averaging for predictions of
similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting
predictions when both models exhibit high uncertainty. This
sample-difficulty-aware approach allows for a dynamic allocation of
computational resources, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining
the high accuracy of MLLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to
using a standalone MLLM.

### [9] [CoCoNUTS: Concentrating on Content while Neglecting Uninformative Textual Styles for AI-Generated Peer Review Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04460)
*Yihan Chen,Jiawei Chen,Guozhao Mo,Xuanang Chen,Ben He,Xianpei Han,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）融入同行评审过程带来公平性和可靠性风险。现有AI生成文本检测器易受攻击，无法区分润色和内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关注LLMs生成实质性评审内容，现有检测器无法有效区分润色和内容生成，导致不公平现象。

Method: 提出CoCoNUTS：一个面向内容的基准，基于AI生成同行评审的细粒度数据集构建。开发CoCoDet：一个多任务学习框架的AI评审检测器。

Result: CoCoDet能更准确、稳健地检测评审内容中AI的参与。

Conclusion: 为评估LLMs在同行评审中的使用提供基础，并为实际学术应用开发更精确、公平和可靠的检测方法。

Abstract: The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review
process presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly
evaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language
refinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive
review content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to
paraphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language
refinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily
rely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result
in unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language
enhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based
detection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark
built upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six
distinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an
AI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve
more accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our
work offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer
review, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and
reliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications. Our code and
data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Y1hanChen/COCONUTS.

### [10] [From Post To Personality: Harnessing LLMs for MBTI Prediction in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04461)
*Tian Ma,Kaiyu Feng,Yu Rong,Kangfei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PostToPersonality (PtoP) 的新框架，用于从社交媒体帖子中预测MBTI人格类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 理解和推断社交媒体内容中的人格特质具有巨大潜力。然而，直接利用LLM进行MBTI预测面临两个关键挑战：LLM固有的幻觉问题和人口中MBTI类型自然不平衡的分布。

Method: PtoP利用检索增强生成与上下文学习来减轻LLM中的幻觉。此外，我们对预训练的LLM进行微调，以通过生成合成样本来平衡类别不平衡，从而提高模型在MBTI理解中的规范性。

Result: 在真实世界的社交媒体数据集上进行的实验表明，与10个ML和DL基线相比，PtoP实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PtoP框架有效地利用了LLM进行MBTI预测，并在缓解幻觉问题和处理数据不平衡方面取得了显著成果。

Abstract: Personality prediction from social media posts is a critical task that
implies diverse applications in psychology and sociology. The Myers Briggs Type
Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality inventory, has been traditionally
predicted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Recently,
the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed their huge potential
in understanding and inferring personality traits from social media content.
However, directly exploiting LLMs for MBTI prediction faces two key challenges:
the hallucination problem inherent in LLMs and the naturally imbalanced
distribution of MBTI types in the population. In this paper, we propose
PostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from
social media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval
Augmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in
LLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification
in MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the
class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. Experiments conducted on a
real world social media dataset demonstrate that PtoP achieves state of the art
performance compared with 10 ML and DL baselines.

### [11] [Benchmarking GPT-5 for biomedical natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04462)
*Yu Hou,Zaifu Zhan,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-5 在 BioNLP 基准测试中表现出色，尤其是在问答方面，但在抽取和总结方面仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估 GPT-5 和 GPT-4o 在生物医学自然语言处理 (BioNLP) 任务中的性能。

Method: 使用固定的 prompt 模板、相同的解码参数和批量推理，在包含 12 个数据集的 BioNLP 基准上，对 GPT-5 和 GPT-4o 进行了零次、一次和五次 prompt 测试。

Result: GPT-5 在整体基准测试中表现最佳，MedQA 准确率达到 94.1%，在 chemical NER 和 ChemProt 关系抽取方面取得了重大进展。但在总结和疾病 NER 方面仍然落后于特定领域的基线。

Conclusion: GPT-5 是一种通用模型，现在可以为面向推理的生物医学问答提供可部署的性能。精度要求高的抽取和证据密集的总结仍然更适合微调或混合方法。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has heightened the need for
scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions. While GPT-4 substantially
narrowed the gap with task-specific systems, especially in question answering,
its performance across other domains remained uneven. We updated a standardized
BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot
prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families: named entity
recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question
answering, text summarization, and text simplification. Using fixed prompt
templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report
primary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and
LLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark
performance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot
prompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached
94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over
fifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734).
In extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and
ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though
summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines.
These results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering
deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while
precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to
favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark delineates where simple
prompting suffices and where retrieval-augmented or planning-based scaffolds
are likely required, providing actionable guidance for BioNLP system design as
frontier models advance.

### [12] [Can Multiple Responses from an LLM Reveal the Sources of Its Uncertainty?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04464)
*Yang Nan,Pengfei He,Ravi Tandon,Han Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(llm)在各个领域都取得了显著的突破，但仍然会产生不可靠或误导性的输出，对实际应用提出了严峻的挑战。本研究表明，当llm不确定时，其多个生成响应之间的分歧模式包含关于不确定性根本原因的丰富线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化模型的不确定性

Method: 从目标llm收集多个响应，并采用辅助llm来分析它们的分歧模式。辅助模型负责推断不确定性的可能来源，例如它是否源于输入问题中的歧义、缺乏相关知识或两者兼而有之。

Result: 在Ambigqa、Openbookqa和MMLU-Pro上验证了该框架，证实了其在诊断不同不确定性来源方面的通用性。

Conclusion: 这种诊断显示了相关的人工干预的潜力，可以提高llm的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have delivered significant breakthroughs across
diverse domains but can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs, posing
critical challenges for real-world applications. While many recent studies
focus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted
to \textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that,
when an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple
generated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of
uncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a
target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of
disagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source
of uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question,
a lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the
auxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts
contributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework
on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing
distinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant
manual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability.

*Sushrita Rakshit,James Hale,Kushal Chawla,Jeanne M. Brett,Jonathan Gratch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了自动文本情感识别是否能洞察争端解决中的影响，并使用买方-卖方争端对话的大型语料库来调查情感表达如何影响主观和客观结果。结果表明，大型语言模型比以前的情感强度注释方法具有更大的解释力，并且更好地匹配人类注释者的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在冲突中，人们使用情感表达来影响对方的想法、感觉和行为。先前的研究表明，这种方法在谈判中很有前景；然而，争端会引发更强烈的情绪和不同的社会过程。

Method: 使用买方-卖方争端对话的大型语料库，并使用大型语言模型进行情感强度注释。

Result: 研究结果支持现有理论模型，即情感表达如何导致冲突升级和解决，并表明基于代理的系统可能通过识别和潜在地减轻情感升级来用于管理争端。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型比以前的情感强度注释方法具有更大的解释力，并且更好地匹配人类注释者的决策。情感表达会影响冲突升级和解决，基于代理的系统可能通过识别和潜在地减轻情感升级来用于管理争端。

Abstract: In conflict, people use emotional expressions to shape their counterparts'
thoughts, feelings, and actions. This paper explores whether automatic text
emotion recognition offers insight into this influence in the context of
dispute resolution. Prior work has shown the promise of such methods in
negotiations; however, disputes evoke stronger emotions and different social
processes. We use a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to
investigate how emotional expressions shape subjective and objective outcomes.
We further demonstrate that large-language models yield considerably greater
explanatory power than previous methods for emotion intensity annotation and
better match the decisions of human annotators. Findings support existing
theoretical models for how emotional expressions contribute to conflict
escalation and resolution and suggest that agent-based systems could be useful
in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional
escalation.

*Yuxuan Li,Declan Campbell,Stephanie C. Y. Chan,Andrew Kyle Lampinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型通过上下文学习来执行新任务，无需更新权重。研究关注模型何时形成新任务的表示，以及这些表示如何随上下文变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型如何在上下文中学习新任务，并理解其内部表示的形成和演变。

Method: 重点研究“可转移”的任务表示，即可以在模型的另一个实例中恢复任务上下文的向量表示，即使没有完整的提示。

Result: 可转移的任务表示以非单调和零星的方式演变，并且不同于在整个上下文中持续存在的高级任务类别的表示。模型通常将多个证据凝结成这些可转移的任务表示，这与基于上下文中更多示例的性能改进非常吻合。但这种累积过程沿序列维度表现出很强的局部性，仅在某些token上出现。这些局部的但可转移的任务表示倾向于捕获最小的“任务范围”，例如语义上独立的子任务，并且模型依赖于更多时间上分布的表示来支持更长和复合的任务。

Conclusion: 这种双重局部性（时间和语义）强调了一种即时计算过程，这种过程是语言模型适应新证据和即时学习新任务能力的基础。

Abstract: Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their
in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and
perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate
\emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and
\emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on
''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can
restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full
prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic
ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task
categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often
condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which
align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the
context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the
sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task
identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local
but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',
such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more
temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.
This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of
just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt

*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的针对预填充-解码 (PD) 分解推理的剪枝方法，以实现更精确和高效的块和 KV 缓存剪枝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在各种任务中表现出卓越的能力，但它们的部署受到高计算和内存成本的限制。模型剪枝提供了一种减轻这些需求的有效方法。然而，现有的方法通常忽略了实践中预填充-解码 (PD) 分解的特性。

Method: 该方法构建剪枝和蒸馏集，以针对预填充和解码阶段独立执行迭代块移除，从而获得更好的剪枝解决方案。此外，还引入了一种令牌感知缓存剪枝机制，该机制保留预填充阶段中的所有 KV 缓存，但有选择地重用解码期间选定层中第一个和最后一个令牌序列的条目，从而以最小的开销降低通信成本。

Result: 在 PD 分解和 PD 统一设置中均实现了强大的性能。在默认设置下，该方法实现了 20.56% 的推理加速和 4.95 倍的数据传输带宽消耗降低。

Conclusion: 该方法在预填充-解码 (PD) 分解推理中能够实现更精确和高效的块和 KV 缓存剪枝，并且在推理速度和数据传输带宽消耗方面有显著提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across
various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and
memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these
demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of
prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a
novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and
efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and
distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the
prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we
introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in
the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token
sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with
minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD
unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method
achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data
transmission bandwidth consumption.

TL;DR: 本文对金融领域的大型语言模型进行了评估，利用CFA考试题来评估不同模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在专业金融环境中的应用潜力，并填补系统评估的空白。

Method: 使用来自CFA一级到三级的1560道选择题，通过零样本提示和检索增强生成（RAG）流程评估不同模型。

Result: 推理导向的模型在零样本设置中表现更好，RAG流程显著提高了复杂场景的性能。知识差距是主要失败原因。

Conclusion: 为金融领域LLM的部署提供了可行性见解，为从业者提供了模型选择和成本效益优化的循证指导。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models presents significant
opportunities for financial applications, yet systematic evaluation in
specialized financial contexts remains limited. This study presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs using 1,560 multiple-choice
questions from official mock exams across Levels I-III of CFA, most rigorous
professional certifications globally that mirror real-world financial analysis
complexity. We compare models distinguished by core design priorities:
multi-modal and computationally powerful, reasoning-specialized and highly
accurate, and lightweight efficiency-optimized.
  We assess models under zero-shot prompting and through a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that integrates official CFA curriculum
content. The RAG system achieves precise domain-specific knowledge retrieval
through hierarchical knowledge organization and structured query generation,
significantly enhancing reasoning accuracy in professional financial
certification evaluation.
  Results reveal that reasoning-oriented models consistently outperform others
in zero-shot settings, while the RAG pipeline provides substantial improvements
particularly for complex scenarios. Comprehensive error analysis identifies
knowledge gaps as the primary failure mode, with minimal impact from text
readability. These findings provide actionable insights for LLM deployment in
finance, offering practitioners evidence-based guidance for model selection and
cost-performance optimization.

TL;DR: COCORELI是一个混合代理框架，旨在解决大型语言模型在需要以下任务中的局限性：遵循复杂指令、最小化幻觉和空间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在遵循复杂指令、最小化幻觉和空间推理方面存在局限性。

Method: COCORELI将中型LLM代理与新颖的抽象机制和话语模块集成，以解析指令，从而在上下文中学习环境的动态、高级表示。

Result: 在自然协作构建任务上的实验表明，COCORELI优于单LLM CoT和代理LLM系统，所有这些系统都使用更大的LLM。它设法在很大程度上避免了幻觉，识别出缺失的信息，要求澄清，并更新了其学习对象。COCORELI的抽象能力超越了ENVIRONMENT，如ToolBench API完成任务所示。

Conclusion: COCORELI是一个有效的框架，可以解决大型语言模型在复杂任务中的局限性。

Abstract: We present COCORELI, a hybrid agent framework designed to tackle the
limitations of large language models (LLMs) in tasks requiring: following
complex instructions, minimizing hallucination, and spatial reasoning. COCORELI
integrates medium-sized LLM agents with novel abstraction mechanisms and a
discourse module to parse instructions to in-context learn dynamic, high-level
representations of the environment. Experiments on natural collaborative
construction tasks show that COCORELI outperforms single-LLM CoT and agentic

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一种用于放射报告分类的多语言、分类无关且计算高效的方法，它基于一个紧凑的开放访问语言模型（MedGemma-4B），支持零/少样本提示和轻量级微调，能够在消费级GPU上部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的放射报告分类方法存在局限性：基于规则的方法难以应对语言变异性，监督模型需要大型带注释的数据集，而基于LLM的系统依赖于闭源或资源密集型模型，不适合临床使用。此外，当前的解决方案主要局限于英语和单模态、单分类数据集。

Method: 提出了一种名为MOSAIC的多语言、分类无关且计算高效的放射报告分类方法。该方法基于一个紧凑的开放访问语言模型（MedGemma-4B），支持零/少样本提示和轻量级微调。

Result: MOSAIC在英语、西班牙语、法语和丹麦语的七个数据集上进行了评估，涵盖多种成像模式和标签分类。该模型在五个胸部X光数据集上实现了88的平均宏F1分数，接近或超过了专家水平，同时只需要24 GB的GPU内存。通过数据增强，仅需80个带注释的样本就足以在丹麦报告上达到82的加权F1分数，而完整的1600个样本训练集则为86。

Conclusion: MOSAIC为临床环境中的大型或专有LLM提供了一种实用的替代方案。代码和模型是开源的，邀请社区评估和扩展MOSAIC到新的语言、分类和模式上。

Abstract: Radiology reports contain rich clinical information that can be used to train
imaging models without relying on costly manual annotation. However, existing
approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with
linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and
recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models
that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely
restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We
introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally
efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact
open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot
prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade
GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and
Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model
achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets,
approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB
of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are
sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86
with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative
to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are
open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new
languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了RECAP，一个新的基准，用于评估和提升意图改写，将用户-代理对话重构为用户目标的简洁表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的对话通常是模糊的、不明确的或动态的，这使得意图检测成为一个持续的挑战。传统的基于分类的方法难以在开放环境中推广，导致脆弱的解释和较差的下游规划。

Method: 论文介绍了一个基于LLM的评估器，用于评估给定重写意图的规划效用。使用RECAP，开发了一种基于prompt的重写方法，该方法优于基线。此外，证明了微调两个基于DPO的重写器可以产生额外的效用增益。

Result: 结果表明，意图改写是改进开放域对话系统中代理规划的关键且易于处理的组成部分。

Conclusion: 意图改写是改进开放域对话系统中代理规划的关键且易于处理的组成部分。

Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in
conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models
(LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often
ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent
challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize
in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream
planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new
benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing
user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures
diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal
conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that
assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a
prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines. We further
demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility
gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable
component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

Motivation: 现有语音编码器与LLM集成面临数据和资源限制，可用性不足。

Method: 采用参数高效的适配器，并使用基于LLM的合成数据集标注技术来降低标注成本。

Result: 适配器使用更少的训练参数，在LibriSpeech ASR任务上实现了26%的相对WER改进，NER任务上实现了6.3%的相对F1分数提高，SA任务上实现了32%的相对F1分数提高。通过添加分类器正则化器和使用LoRA优化LLM，SLUE分数提高了6.6%和9.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在参数效率和性能方面均取得了显著提升，为语音和语言模型的集成提供了一种有效途径。

Abstract: While integrating speech encoder with LLM requires substantial data and
resources, use cases face limitations due to insufficient availability. To
address this, we propose a solution with a parameter-efficient adapter that
converts speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, focusing on end-to-end
automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and
sentiment analysis (SA). To reduce labeling costs, we employ an LLM-based
synthetic dataset annotation technique. The proposed adapter, using 7x fewer
trainable parameters, achieves significant performance gains: a 26% relative
Word Error Rates (WER) improvement on the LibriSpeech ASR task, a 6.3% relative
F1 score increase on the NER task, and a 32% relative F1 score boost on the SA
task. Moreover, using advanced techniques such as adding a classifier
regularizer and optimizing the LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields
notable performance gains, with Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE)
score improvement of 6.6% and 9.5%

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何使用推测解码加速LLM的测试时缩放，并提出了一个综合的基准来评估不同的推测解码方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放通过在推理期间分配额外的计算资源来增强大型语言模型（LLM）的推理能力，但由于生成冗余和重复的推理轨迹，因此效率低下。推测解码为缓解这种低效率提供了一条有希望的途径，但其在测试时缩放的结构化、重复丰富的环境中的有效性仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 本文构建了一个基准，用于评估加速LLM测试时缩放的推测解码方法。该基准提供了跨代表性测试时缩放范例（例如，Best-of-N抽样和多轮思考）的一致实验协议，从而可以公平地比较三种主要的推测解码类别：基于模型的方法、基于训练的方法和基于n-gram的方法。

Result: 实验表明，简单的基于n-gram的方法有效地捕获了重复模式，从而在加速测试时缩放方面表现出独特的潜力。这种现象证明了将基于n-gram的方法与基于模型或基于训练的方法相结合的价值，以平衡测试时缩放中重复和多样化推理的加速。

Conclusion: 我们希望这个基准能够促进对测试时缩放的推测解码的进一步研究，通过更好地处理重复和多样化的推理路径，从而在LLM中实现更快，更实用的推理。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional
computational resources during inference. However, this paradigm is inherently
inefficient due to the generation of redundant and repetitive reasoning traces,
leading to significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding offers a
promising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the
structured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely
unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM
test-time scaling. Our benchmark provides consistent experimental protocols
across representative test-time scaling paradigms (e.g., Best-of-N sampling and
multi-round thinking), enabling a fair comparison of three major categories of
speculative decoding: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods.
Extensive experiments reveal that simple n-gram-based methods effectively
capture repetitive patterns, demonstrating unique potential in accelerating
test-time scaling. This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating
n-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance
acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling. We
hope this benchmark spurs further research on speculative decoding for
test-time scaling, enabling faster and more practical reasoning in LLMs through
better handling of repetitive and diverse reasoning paths.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的LLM扩展范式，称为原生思想并行，旨在解决现有方法中存在的“隧道视觉”问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM通过增加计算量来提高推理能力，但当计算量增加到一定程度时，性能提升变得微乎其微。这是因为模型最初的不完美步骤会使其陷入次优的推理路径。

Method: 论文提出了ParaThinker框架，该框架训练LLM并行生成多个不同的推理路径，并将它们合成为一个更优的最终答案。

Result: ParaThinker在具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，与顺序LLM相比，准确性得到了显著提高（对于1.5B模型平均提高了12.3%，对于7B模型平均提高了7.5%，使用了8个并行路径），而只增加了微不足道的延迟开销（7.1%）。

Conclusion: 并行思考是扩展未来LLM的关键且高效的维度，它使较小的模型能够超越更大的模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time
compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer,
sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a
significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation
offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an
inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy
itself, a phenomenon we term "Tunnel Vision", where a model's imperfect initial
steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce
a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an
end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning
paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By
exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively
sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning
potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width)
is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling
sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves
substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5%
for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible
latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger
counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient
dimension for scaling future LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的文本到分子模型依赖于原子级别的tokenization，限制了模型捕捉分子内的全局结构上下文的能力。

Method: 引入子结构级别的tokenization，并开发了一种基于重要性的训练策略，优先考虑关键子结构。

Result: CAMT5在各种文本到分子生成任务中表现优异，仅使用2%的训练tokens就超过了最先进的方法。此外，还提出了一种简单的集成策略来进一步提高生成性能。

Conclusion: CAMT5有效地提升了文本到分子的生成效果，且具有更高的效率。

Abstract: Recently, text-to-molecule models have shown great potential across various
chemical applications, e.g., drug-discovery. These models adapt language models
to molecular data by representing molecules as sequences of atoms. However,
they rely on atom-level tokenizations, which primarily focus on modeling local
connectivity, thereby limiting the ability of models to capture the global
structural context within molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
text-to-molecule model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by
the significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule
structures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization
for text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an
importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling
CAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify
the superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks.
Intriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using
only 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective
ensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to
further boost the generation performance. Code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end mobile system that delivers
culturally-attuned safe driving feedback to drivers in Nigeria, a low-resource
environment with significant infrastructural challenges. The core of the system
is a novel dual-component Natural Language Generation (NLG) engine that
provides both legally-grounded safety tips and persuasive, theory-driven
behavioural reports. We describe the complete system architecture, including an
automatic trip detection service, on-device behaviour analysis, and a
sophisticated NLG pipeline that leverages a two-step reflection process to
ensure high-quality feedback. The system also integrates a specialized machine
learning model for detecting alcohol-influenced driving, a key local safety
issue. The architecture is engineered for robustness against intermittent
connectivity and noisy sensor data. A pilot deployment with 90 drivers
demonstrates the viability of our approach, and initial results on detected
unsafe behaviours are presented. This work provides a framework for applying

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中稀有token预测的机制，特别是plateau神经元的功能组织。

Method: 通过神经元影响分析、图聚类和注意力头消融在GPT-2 XL和Pythia模型中进行研究。

Result: 发现稀有token处理需要额外的plateau神经元，这些神经元空间分布，且注意力机制没有优先路由到专家。

Conclusion: 稀有token的专业化是通过分布式、训练驱动的分化产生的，而不是通过架构模块化，从而在实现自适应容量分配的同时，保持了上下文敏感的灵活性。

Abstract: Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, yet the mechanisms
driving their specialization remain unclear. Prior work identified specialized
``plateau'' neurons for rare tokens following distinctive three-regime
influence patterns \cite{liu2025emergent}, but their functional organization is
unknown. We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based
clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our
findings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau
neurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual
computational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather
than forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no
preferential routing to specialists. These results demonstrate that rare token
specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation
rather than architectural modularity, preserving context-sensitive flexibility
while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型在视觉情感识别中表现出潜力，但由于其训练数据偏向于多数观点和常见模式，因此在个性化情感识别方面存在不足，这限制了其在实际应用中的性能。

Result: 未提供具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提供具体结论。

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is an important research topic due to its
wide range of applications, including opinion mining and advertisement design.
Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further
broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance
comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on
large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to
favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their
performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and
real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address
this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by
the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each
individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from
the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of
accurate personalized VER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RAG系统中，可靠的拒绝回答至关重要，尤其是在安全关键领域，因为不正确的答案可能导致危害。

Method: 该模型通过学习一个基于260万条指南衍生问题的密集语义语料库的平滑能量景观，使系统能够决定何时生成或拒绝回答。

Result: EBM在语义上困难的情况下实现了卓越的拒绝性能，AUROC达到0.961，而softmax为0.950，同时还降低了FPR@95（0.235 vs 0.331）。

Conclusion: 基于能量的拒绝评分比基于概率的softmax置信度提供更可靠的置信度信号，为安全的RAG系统提供可扩展且可解释的基础。

Abstract: Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, particularly in safety-critical domains such as women's health, where
incorrect answers can lead to harm. We present an energy-based model (EBM) that
learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M
guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or
abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a
k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard
abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging
near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance
abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for
softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives,
performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most
pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with
controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems
primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of
specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is
not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that
energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than
probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable
foundation for safe RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种自动评估claim分解质量的新方法，旨在提高fact-checking系统的可靠性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注claim分解的生成方法，而忽略了对分解后的原子claim质量的评估。

Method: 提出了DecMetrics，包含三个新指标：COMPLETENESS、CORRECTNESS和SEMANTIC ENTROPY，用于自动评估分解模型生成的claim质量。同时，开发了一个轻量级的claim分解模型，并通过将这些指标作为奖励函数来优化其性能。

Result: 通过自动评估，该方法旨在为claim分解设定基准。

Conclusion: 该研究旨在提高fact-checking系统的可靠性和有效性。

Abstract: Claim decomposition plays a crucial role in the fact-checking process by
breaking down complex claims into simpler atomic components and identifying
their unfactual elements. Despite its importance, current research primarily
focuses on generative methods for decomposition, with insufficient emphasis on
evaluating the quality of these decomposed atomic claims. To bridge this gap,
we introduce \textbf{DecMetrics}, which comprises three new metrics:
\texttt{COMPLETENESS}, \texttt{CORRECTNESS}, and \texttt{SEMANTIC ENTROPY},
designed to automatically assess the quality of claims produced by
decomposition models. Utilizing these metrics, we develop a lightweight claim
decomposition model, optimizing its performance through the integration of
these metrics as a reward function. Through automatic evaluation, our approach
aims to set a benchmark for claim decomposition, enhancing both the reliability
and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了RevUtil数据集，用于评估论文评审意见的质量，并提出了评估评审意见的四个关键方面：可操作性、依据与具体性、可验证性和帮助性。通过实验，证明了微调模型在评估这些方面和生成理由方面可以达到与人类相当甚至超过GPT-4o的水平。分析表明，机器生成的评论在这四个方面通常不如人类评论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着审稿人时间的减少，需要自动支持系统来确保高质量的审稿，从而使审稿中的反馈对作者有用。为了实现这个目标，本文确定了驱动作者效用的评审意见的四个关键方面。

Method: 1. 收集了1430个人工标注的评审意见，并用10k个合成标注的意见来扩大数据规模，用于训练。合成数据还包含理由，即评审意见的方面分数的解释。
2. 使用RevUtil数据集，对微调模型进行基准测试，以评估这些方面的评审意见并生成理由。

Result: 微调模型在评估这些方面和生成理由方面可以达到与人类相当甚至超过GPT-4o的水平。机器生成的评论在这四个方面通常不如人类评论。

Conclusion: 本文引入RevUtil数据集，为评估和发展评估评审意见的模型提供了支持。实验结果表明，微调模型在评估评审意见的质量方面具有潜力，但机器生成的评论仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is a core component of peer
review. With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews,
automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus
making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify
four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of
reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding &
Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and
development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil
dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with
10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data
additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a
review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models
for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our
experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels
with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful
closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated
reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.

*Chris Sainsbury,Andreas Karwath*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASCENDgpt is a transformer model for cardiovascular risk prediction using EHR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predict cardiovascular outcomes from longitudinal EHR data.

Method: A phenotype-aware tokenization scheme maps ICD codes to clinically meaningful phenotype tokens. The model is pretrained and then fine-tuned for time-to-event prediction.

Result: The model achieves an average C-index of 0.816 on the held-out test set.

Conclusion: Domain-specific tokenization and pretraining are effective for EHR-based risk prediction.

Abstract: We present ASCENDgpt, a transformer-based model specifically designed for
cardiovascular risk prediction from longitudinal electronic health records
(EHRs). Our approach introduces a novel phenotype-aware tokenization scheme
that maps 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 clinically meaningful phenotype tokens,
achieving 99.6\% consolidation of diagnosis codes while preserving semantic
information. This phenotype mapping contributes to a total vocabulary of 10,442
tokens - a 77.9\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We
pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a
masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction
of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause
mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set
with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all
outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842,
all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically
interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work
demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining
for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

### [32] [Serialized Output Prompting for Large Language Model-based Multi-Talker Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04488)
*Hao Shi,Yusuke Fujita,Tomoya Mizumoto,Lianbo Liu,Atsushi Kojima,Yui Sudo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用结构化提示来改进基于LLM的多说话人自动语音识别(ASR)系统性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的多说话人ASR系统要么省略提示，要么依赖简单的任务定义提示，没有先前的研究探索提示的设计以提高性能。

Method: 该方法提取序列化输出提示(SOP)，并使用结构化提示显式地引导LLM，从而提高系统性能(SOP-MT-ASR)。

Result: 在LibriMix数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的SOP方法显著提高了在两个和三个说话人条件下的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，所提出的SOP方法可以有效地提高基于LLM的多说话人ASR系统的性能，尤其是在更复杂的场景下。

Abstract: Prompts are crucial for task definition and for improving the performance of
large language models (LLM)-based systems. However, existing LLM-based
multi-talker (MT) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems either omit
prompts or rely on simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring
the design of prompts to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose
extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using
structured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and
serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted
after the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed
speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP,
which serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC
outputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a
three-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT)
fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based
adaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although
the LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to
fully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker
scenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under
both two- and three-talker conditions.

*Xinnian Zhao,Hugo Van Hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的方法，在弱监督 (WS) 自动语音识别 (ASR) 框架中使用电视字幕。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然电视字幕很容易获得，但它们与相应音频的不精确对齐限制了它们作为逐字转录的监督目标的应用。

Method: 我们的方法将字幕重新想象为富含上下文的提示，生成伪转录成为主要目标，字幕作为迭代细化的指导线索。为了进一步增强该过程，我们引入了一种加权注意力机制，该机制在推理过程中强调相关的字幕标记。

Result: 我们的实验证明了转录准确性的显着提高，突出了所提出的方法在改进转录方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 这些增强的伪标记数据集为训练强大的 ASR 系统提供了高质量的基础资源。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to using TV subtitles within a weakly
supervised (WS) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework. Although TV
subtitles are readily available, their imprecise alignment with corresponding
audio limits their applicability as supervised targets for verbatim
transcription. Rather than using subtitles as direct supervision signals, our
method reimagines them as context-rich prompts. This design enables the model
to handle discrepancies between spoken audio and subtitle text. Instead,
generated pseudo transcripts become the primary targets, with subtitles acting
as guiding cues for iterative refinement. To further enhance the process, we
introduce a weighted attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant subtitle
tokens during inference. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements
in transcription accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
method in refining transcripts. These enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide
high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems.

*Charles Moslonka,Hicham Randrianarivo,Arthur Garnier,Emmanuel Malherbe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于检测大型语言模型在问答任务中幻觉的方法，该方法特别适用于数据访问受限的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 输出中用于问答 (QA) 任务的幻觉严重破坏了它们在现实世界中的可靠性。

Method: 该方法通过非贪婪解码过程中生成的 readily available log-probabilities 直接导出不确定性指标。首先，导出一个熵产生率 (EPR) 指标，该指标提供基线性能，随后通过监督学习进行增强。

Result: 在各种 QA 数据集和多个 LLM 上进行评估，该估计器显着提高了幻觉检测能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一种 readily deployable 技术，可以通过在 QA 和检索增强生成 (RAG) 系统中从单个生成过程中增强 LLM 响应的可信度，并在分析来自工业数据集的年度报告查询响应的金融框架中进一步证明了其效用。

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering
(QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper
introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection,
specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as
interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top
candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty
indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated
during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR)
metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised
learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic
contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated
sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA
datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination
detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated
using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top
<10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these
API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique
to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass
in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility
further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on
annual reports from an industrial dataset.

*Syed Ahmad Chan Bukhari,Fazel Keshtkar,Alyssa Meczkowska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究利用ICU出院总结中的临床叙述，通过结合BioBERT情感嵌入、词汇压力词典和LDA等方法，构建了一个混合管道来监测临床医生的职业倦怠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生职业倦怠对患者安全构成威胁，尤其是在高危ICU中。现有研究主要依赖回顾性调查工具或广泛的电子健康记录元数据，忽略了临床笔记中嵌入的有价值的叙述信息。

Method: 分析了来自MIMIC-IV的10,000份ICU出院总结，该数据库包含生命体征、医嘱、诊断、程序、治疗和去识别化的自由文本临床笔记等患者数据。引入了一个混合管道，该管道结合了为临床叙述微调的BioBERT情感嵌入、为临床医生职业倦怠监测定制的词汇压力词典，以及具有工作负载代理的五主题潜在狄利克雷分配（LDA）。

Result: 提供者级别的逻辑回归分类器在分层保留集上实现了0.80的精度、0.89的召回率和0.84的F1分数，超过了仅元数据基线至少0.17 F1分数。专业特定分析表明，放射科、精神科和神经科的提供者面临较高的职业倦怠风险。

Conclusion: ICU临床叙述包含可用于主动健康监测的可操作信号。

Abstract: Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly
in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly
relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR)
metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in
clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from
MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health
records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses
diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses,
procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce
a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for
clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout
surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload
proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision
of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out
set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1
score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among
providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate
that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive
well-being monitoring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在教育规划等日常推荐系统中应用日益广泛，但其推荐可能存在社会偏见。本文研究了三个开源LLM（LLaMA-3.1-8B、Gemma-7B和Mistral-7B）在大学和专业推荐中的地域、人口和经济偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推荐系统存在偏见，可能使社会偏见长期存在，需要进行研究。

Method: 使用360个模拟用户配置文件（按性别、国籍和经济状况划分），分析超过25000条推荐。

Result: 研究表明存在明显的偏见：全球北方的院校明显更受欢迎，推荐通常会强化性别刻板印象，并且院校重复率很高。LLaMA-3.1实现了最高的院校多样性，推荐了58个国家的481所独特的大学，但系统性差异仍然存在。

Conclusion: 教育LLM迫切需要考虑偏见问题，以确保全球公平地获得高等教育。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation
systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk
perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic,
demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from
three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360
simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we
analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions
in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often
reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While
LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities
across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we
propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond
accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure
equitable global access to higher education.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为DeepTRACE的新型审计框架，用于评估生成式搜索引擎和深度研究LLM代理的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式搜索引擎和深度研究LLM代理在信息来源、引用和可信度方面存在问题。

Method: DeepTRACE框架将社区先前发现的失败案例转化为八个可衡量的维度，涵盖答案文本、来源和引用。它使用语句级别的分析（分解、置信度评分）并构建引用和事实支持矩阵，以审计系统如何端到端地进行推理和归因。

Result: 评估结果表明，生成式搜索引擎和深度研究代理经常在辩论查询中产生片面、高度自信的回答，并且包含大量未被其自身列出的来源支持的陈述。深度研究配置可以减少过度自信并实现高引用彻底性，但在辩论查询中仍然非常片面，并且仍然表现出很大比例的不受支持的陈述，系统间的引用准确率在40-80%之间。

Conclusion: 生成式搜索引擎和深度研究LLM代理在可靠性方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents promise trustworthy,
source-grounded synthesis, yet users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak
sourcing, and confusing citation practices. We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel
sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified
failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources,
and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition,
confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit
how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated
extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com,
Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to
human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research
configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep
research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on
debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their
own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can
attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate
queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with
citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems.

TL;DR: LLMs容易受到不常见但有害的上下文信息的影响，导致回复质量下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何处理混合了相关和不相关信息的上下文，特别是不良信息带来的可靠性风险。

Method: 引入了Poisoned Context Testbed，并借鉴神经科学的Rescorla-Wagner模型来量化上下文信号对LLM输出的影响。

Result: LLMs倾向于整合上下文中不常见的信息，即使这些信息是不良的。RW-Steering方法能有效识别并忽略这些不良信号，从而提高回复质量。

Conclusion: RW-Steering是一种鲁棒且通用的上下文工程解决方案，可以提高LLM在实际应用中的安全性。

Abstract: Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix
relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing
reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study
this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with
real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by
associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from
neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM
outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs
exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in
the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small
amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality.
Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To
tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach
that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals.
Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context
mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of
inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves
response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve,
establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering
solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.

Motivation: 现有算法解释通常假设读者具备先验知识，缺乏关键细节，或者过于笼统和复杂。本文旨在消除歧义，提供对这些概念清晰直观的理解。

Method: 本文使用简化的显式符号，逐步讨论和开发每种方法，重点关注LLM，并避免过多地涉及更广泛的RL文献。

Result: 本文对这些算法进行了详细阐述，并回顾了该领域的新技术和方法。最后，提出了一种新的研究思路，即GRAPE（广义相对优势策略演化）。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为LLM指令微调算法提供清晰、直观和易于理解的解释，并为未来的研究方向提供思路。

Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key
algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling,
REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume
prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and
complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using
simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity
and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing
detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we
eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following
this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and
approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and
exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy
Evolution) are presented.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成(RAG)的有效性受到检索器精度的限制，许多检索到的样本与生成阶段无关或具有误导性，严重阻碍了LLM的性能。

Method: 该论文提出了VaccineRAG，一个基于思维链(CoT)的检索增强生成数据集。它通过使用不同正/负样本比例的数据来评估模型，并提示LLM为每个样本生成显式的CoT分析，从而增强模型的样本辨别能力。此外，还提出了Partial-GRPO来增强模型学习长序列复杂CoT内容的能力。

Result: 在VaccineRAG上的综合评估和消融研究验证了所提出方案的有效性。

Conclusion: VaccineRAG有效地提高了LLM的响应准确性，并通过Partial-GRPO增强了模型学习复杂CoT内容的能力。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with
external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and
Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is
frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples
fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical
bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce
VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation
dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using
data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing
inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models'
sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers.
Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT
content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple
components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed
preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to
learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG
validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be
publicly released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLM）的基准主要侧重于性能指标，通常未能捕捉到区分它们的细微行为特征。

Method: 使用精心设计的“诊断提示套件”和一个创新的自动化评估流程，其中强大的LLM充当公正的评判者，我们分析了跨能力级别的18个模型。

Result: 结果揭示了LLM领域的一个关键差异：虽然抽象和因果推理等核心能力在顶级模型中趋于收敛，但诸如奉承和语义鲁棒性等与对齐相关的行为差异很大。我们进一步记录了一个跨模型的默认角色聚类（ISTJ/ESTJ），这可能反映了常见的对齐激励。

Conclusion: 总之，这表明模型的交互性质不是其规模或推理能力的涌现属性，而是特定且高度可变的开发者对齐策略的直接结果。我们的框架为揭示这些深层行为差异提供了一种可复制且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on
performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral
characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel
``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional
evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive
and interactive styles. Using a curated \textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an
innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an
impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our
results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core
capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top
models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness
vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering
(ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together,
this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of
its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly
variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible
and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成语音中存在的语音模糊和噪声问题，这些问题阻碍了 SSI 的识别和下游处理。

Method: 结合基于 Transformer 的声学模型与大型语言模型（LLM）进行后处理。Transformer 捕捉完整的语句上下文，而 LLM 确保语言一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，相对于 36% 的基线，词错误率（WER）相对降低了 16%，绝对降低了 6%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了无声语音接口的可理解性。

Abstract: Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) have gained attention for their ability to
generate intelligible speech from non-acoustic signals. While significant
progress has been made in advancing speech generation pipelines, limited work
has addressed the recognition and downstream processing of synthesized speech,
which often suffers from phonetic ambiguity and noise. To overcome these
challenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that
combines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM)
for post-processing. The transformer captures full utterance context, while the
LLM ensures linguistic consistency. Experimental results show a 16% relative
and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline,
demonstrating substantial improvements in intelligibility for silent speech
interfaces.

Motivation: 研究 SLM 在复杂问题中的局限性，并探索多智能体系统作为替代方案。

Method: 在 AppWorld 环境中使用不同大小的语言模型实例化单智能体和多智能体系统，并提出一种渐进式子任务训练策略。

Result: 发现 SLM 在长程学习方面存在困难，并且渐进式训练策略可以提高多智能体系统的有效性。

Conclusion: 微调的多智能体系统在有效性和效率之间取得了更好的平衡，并且渐进式训练策略能够降低子任务错误率。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) present a viable
alternative to single agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) for
addressing complex problems. In this work, we study how these alternatives
compare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off,
we instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the
AppWorld environment using different sized language models.
  We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language
models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles,
SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we
introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new
sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel
strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently
improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto
analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better
effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows
the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce
subtask error rates.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用虚拟现实(VR)和人工智能(AI)来预测意大利和西班牙大学生中是否存在阅读障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是调查基于VR的无声阅读(SR)测试和自尊评估数据是否可以区分患有阅读障碍的学生和未患有阅读障碍的学生。

Method: 采用机器学习(ML)算法，让参与者完成基于VR的任务，测量阅读表现和自尊。对这些数据进行了初步统计分析(t检验和Mann Whitney检验)，比较了有和没有阅读障碍的个体之间的得分，然后训练和测试了监督ML模型。

Result: 结果表明，意大利的准确率为87.5%，西班牙的准确率为66.6%，汇总组的准确率为75.0%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，VR和ML可以有效地用作评估阅读障碍的辅助工具，特别通过捕捉任务完成速度的差异，但特定于语言的因素可能会影响分类准确性。

Abstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial
intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish
university students. In particular, the research investigates whether
VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can
differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that
are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed
VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary
statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was
performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without
dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test,
but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were
trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence
of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for
Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR
and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia,
particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but
language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）处理情感内容的能力，尤其是在心理健康领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建安全可靠的系统，理解LLM如何处理情感内容至关重要。

Method: 构建了一个新的数据集，合并了多个人工撰写的心理健康数据集，并通过ChatGPT生成的情感重新解释提示进行扩充。评估了四个LLaMA模型（1B、3B、8B、70B）在零样本、少样本和微调设置下的表现。

Result: 更大的LLM取得了更强的平均性能，尤其是在细致的多标签分类和零样本设置中。轻量级微调使1B模型在几个高数据类别中实现了与更大模型和BERT相当的性能，并且在推理时需要<2GB VRAM。

Conclusion: 较小的、设备上的模型可以作为敏感应用的可行、保护隐私的替代方案，提供解释情感上下文和维持安全对话边界的能力。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive
content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in
mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key
tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs.
borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk
taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several
human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with
emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA
models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.
Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance,
particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings.
However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance
comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while
requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller,
on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for
sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and
maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications
for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical
systems.

Motivation: 探讨AI生成的职业故事中存在的性别和种族偏见问题。

Method: 通过BAME方法，利用模型生成的解释来指导提示工程，从而减少偏见。

Result: BAME方法使人口统计学表征提高了2%到20%。

Conclusion: 通过模型自身的内部推理机制引导模型，可以显著提高人口统计学的均等性，从而有助于开发更具透明度的生成式AI系统。

Abstract: Language models have been shown to propagate social bias through their
output, particularly in the representation of gender and ethnicity. This paper
investigates gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated occupational stories.
Representation biases are measured before and after applying our proposed
mitigation strategy, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME),
revealing improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20%.
BAME leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt
engineering, effectively reducing biases without modifying model parameters. By
analyzing stories generated across 25 occupational groups, three large language
models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and GPT-4 Turbo), and
multiple demographic dimensions, we identify persistent patterns of
overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes.
Our findings demonstrate that guiding models with their own internal reasoning
mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, thereby contributing
to the development of more transparent generative AI systems.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型在跨语言性能方面的公平性问题，发现即使经过高质量的翻译，母语训练的模型性能仍优于翻译后的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨英语在训练数据中的主导地位是否会使非英语使用者处于不利地位，以及数据差异是否会影响模型性能。

Method: 比较了两个单语BERT模型：一个完全在斯瓦希里语数据上训练和测试，另一个在可比的英语新闻数据上训练和测试。将斯瓦希里语新闻数据翻译成英语，并使用英语训练的模型进行评估。

Result: 结果表明，尽管翻译质量很高，但本地斯瓦希里语训练模型的性能优于斯瓦希里语到英语的翻译模型，误差减少了近四倍：分别为0.36％和1.47％。

Conclusion: 翻译不能弥合语言之间的表征差异，并且以一种语言训练的模型可能难以准确解释翻译后的输入，这意味着母语训练对于可靠的结果仍然很重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand multilingual capabilities, questions
remain about the equity of their performance across languages. While many
communities stand to benefit from AI systems, the dominance of English in
training data risks disadvantaging non-English speakers. To test the hypothesis
that such data disparities may affect model performance, this study compares
two monolingual BERT models: one trained and tested entirely on Swahili data,
and another on comparable English news data. To simulate how multilingual LLMs
process non-English queries through internal translation and abstraction, we
translated the Swahili news data into English and evaluated it using the
English-trained model. This approach tests the hypothesis by evaluating whether
translating Swahili inputs for evaluation on an English model yields better or
worse performance compared to training and testing a model entirely in Swahili,
thus isolating the effect of language consistency versus cross-lingual
abstraction. The results prove that, despite high-quality translation, the
native Swahili-trained model performed better than the Swahili-to-English
translated model, producing nearly four times fewer errors: 0.36% vs. 1.47%
respectively. This gap suggests that translation alone does not bridge
representational differences between languages and that models trained in one
language may struggle to accurately interpret translated inputs due to
imperfect internal knowledge representation, suggesting that native-language
training remains important for reliable outcomes. In educational and
informational contexts, even small performance gaps may compound inequality.
Future research should focus on addressing broader dataset development for
underrepresented languages and renewed attention to multilingual model
evaluation, ensuring the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing
digital divides is reduced.

Abstract: Mesh implants are widely utilized in hernia repair surgeries, but
postoperative complications present a significant concern. This study analyzes
patient reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience
(MAUDE) database spanning 2000 to 2021 to investigate the emotional aspects of
patients following mesh implantation using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Employing the National Research Council Canada (NRC) Emotion Lexicon and
TextBlob for sentiment analysis, the research categorizes patient narratives
into eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy,
and disgust) and assesses sentiment polarity. The goal is to discern patterns
in patient sentiment over time and to identify reports signaling urgent
concerns, referred to as "Concern Reports," thereby understanding shifts in
patient experiences in relation to changes in medical device regulation and
technological advancements in healthcare. The study detected an increase in
Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during the periods of 2011-2012
and 2017-2018. Through temporal analysis of Concern Reports and overall
sentiment, this research provides valuable insights for healthcare
practitioners, enhancing their understanding of patient experiences
post-surgery, which is critical for improving preoperative counselling,
postoperative care, and preparing patients for mesh implant surgeries. The
study underscores the importance of emotional considerations in medical
practices and the potential for sentiment analysis to inform and enhance
patient care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在工具使用方面表现出色，但其巨大的资源需求和计算复杂性限制了其在所有用例中的使用。因此，越来越需要更紧凑和高效的小型语言模型(slm)。与大型语言模型(llm)相比，小型语言模型(slm)在工具使用方面存在不足。

Method: 使用强化学习(rl)，特别是群体相对策略优化(grpo)，以提高slm的工具使用能力。

Result: 该方法提供了一种高效、有效的解决方案，可显著提高slm工具的使用准确性，从而提高它们的实际效用。

Conclusion: 本研究通过强化学习显著提高了小型语言模型(slm)的工具使用能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have progressed beyond simple text creation, and
tool use has become increasingly important for complex, real-world tasks. Tool
use in LLMs refers to their ability to utilize external resources such as APIs,
databases, or software functions to extend their functionality beyond
generating text.Tools are used for tasks such as performing calculations,
making API calls to retrieve the current time and date, and more. This
capability enables models to fetch real-time data, execute commands, or solve
problems requiring dynamic interaction, making it indispensable for
applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, or
automated workflows.
  However, while LLMs are usually adept tool use, their vast resource
requirements and computation complexity restrict their use in every use case.As
a result, there is an increasing need for more compact and efficient Small
Language Models (SLMs). Small language models (SLMs) struggle in tool use
compared to large language models (LLMs). As soon in Table 1. SLMs are
typically trained on smaller, more specific datasets, resulting in a narrower
knowledge base and limited contextual understanding compared to LLMs.
  This research addresses these challenges by using Reinforcement Learning
(RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance
tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that
require heavy computation and often lack adaptability, our method provides an
efficient, effective solution that significantly boosts SLM tool-use accuracy,
increasing their practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从放射学报告中提取结构化临床信息具有挑战性，尤其是在低资源语言中。克罗恩病的多器官表现稀疏，使得这一问题更加突出。

Method: 开发了Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT)模型，一种prompt-based模型，用于从希伯来语放射学文本中提取信息。该模型在包含9,683份克罗恩病患者报告的数据集上进行了分析，并在512份报告的子集上进行了放射科医生标注，涵盖六个胃肠器官和15种病理，每个受试者产生90个结构化标签。

Result: 在超过15个阳性结果的24个器官-发现组合中，HSMP-BERT实现了平均F1值为0.83±0.08，Cohen's kappa值为0.65±0.17，优于SMP zero-shot基线和标准微调方法。分层推理将运行时间缩短了5.1倍。应用于所有报告后，揭示了回肠壁增厚、狭窄和狭窄前扩张之间的关联，以及炎症表现中年龄和性别特异性趋势。

Conclusion: HSMP-BERT为放射学中的结构化提取提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，能够对克罗恩病进行人群水平的分析，并展示了人工智能在低资源环境中的潜力。

Abstract: Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is
challenging, especially in low-resource languages. This is pronounced in
Crohn's disease, with sparsely represented multi-organ findings. We developed
Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based
model for extraction from Hebrew radiology text. In an administrative database
study, we analyzed 9,683 reports from Crohn's patients imaged 2010-2023 across
Israeli providers. A subset of 512 reports was radiologist-annotated for
findings across six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathologies, yielding 90
structured labels per subject. Multilabel-stratified split (66%
train+validation; 33% test), preserving label prevalence. Performance was
evaluated with accuracy, F1, Cohen's $\kappa$, AUC, PPV, NPV, and recall. On 24
organ-finding combinations with $>$15 positives, HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1
0.83$\pm$0.08 and $\kappa$ 0.65$\pm$0.17, outperforming the SMP zero-shot
baseline (F1 0.49$\pm$0.07, $\kappa$ 0.06$\pm$0.07) and standard fine-tuning
(F1 0.30$\pm$0.27, $\kappa$ 0.27$\pm$0.34; paired t-test $p < 10^{-7}$).
Hierarchical inference cuts runtime 5.1$\times$ vs. traditional inference.
Applied to all reports, it revealed associations among ileal wall thickening,
stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, plus age- and sex-specific trends in
inflammatory findings. HSMP-BERT offers a scalable solution for structured
extraction in radiology, enabling population-level analysis of Crohn's disease
and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: LLM为研究哥伦比亚武装冲突提供了一种新的研究方法。

Abstract: Colombia has been submerged in decades of armed conflict, yet until recently,
the systematic documentation of violence was not a priority for the Colombian
government. This has resulted in a lack of publicly available conflict
information and, consequently, a lack of historical accounts. This study
contributes to Colombia's historical memory by utilizing GPT, a large language
model (LLM), to read and answer questions about over 200,000 violence-related
newspaper articles in Spanish. We use the resulting dataset to conduct both
descriptive analysis and a study of the relationship between violence and the
eradication of coca crops, offering an example of policy analyses that such
data can support. Our study demonstrates how LLMs have opened new research
opportunities by enabling examinations of large text corpora at a previously
infeasible depth.

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了重要的实践和指导价值，强调量化是实现大型但高容量语言模型在生物医学环境中安全、本地部署的实用有效策略，弥合了人工智能技术进步与现实世界临床转化之间的差距。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in biomedical
natural language processing, yet their rapid growth in size and computational
requirements present a major barrier to adoption in healthcare settings where
data privacy precludes cloud deployment and resources are limited. In this
study, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12
state-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and
biomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key
tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label
classification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially
reduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance
across diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB
consumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness
to advanced prompting methods are largely maintained. These findings provide
significant practical and guiding value, highlighting quantization as a
practical and effective strategy for enabling the secure, local deployment of
large yet high-capacity language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the
gap between technical advances in AI and real-world clinical translation.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks, but fine-grained

transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts,
activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an
optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified
framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and
weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including
adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal
weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects.
Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits
while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs
exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation.
This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language

Abstract: Sarcasm, a common feature of human communication, poses challenges in
interpersonal interactions and human-machine interactions. Linguistic research
has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch,
speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous
work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in
recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech
technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for
automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for
individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding
of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This
systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition,
charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers
datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge
gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in
datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction
techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based
representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal
approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need
for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as
well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather
than a text-based challenge.

*Osman Batur İnce,André F. T. Martins,Oisin Mac Aodha,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SEMI的样本高效模态集成方法，用于将新模态集成到大型语言模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将模态集成到预训练模型中需要大量配对数据，这对于低资源模态来说通常不可行。因此，需要一种样本高效的方法。

Method: 设计了一个超网络，用于调整共享投影器，使其适应任何模态。该超网络在高资源模态上进行训练，并在推理时以任意模态的少量样本为条件，生成合适的适配器。为了增加训练模态的多样性，通过等距变换人工增加编码器的数量。

Result: SEMI在少量样本集成新模态方面取得了显著的效率提升。例如，达到与32-shot SEMI相同的精度，从头开始训练投影器需要64倍的数据。

Conclusion: SEMI有希望扩展基础模型的模态覆盖范围。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since
the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a
model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover,
integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires
a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for
low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for
sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).
To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --
placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The
hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,
video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at
inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of
training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through
isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in
sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,
satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)
with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the
same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs
64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality
coverage of foundation models.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical
security challenges, where adversarial actors can manipulate input prompts to
cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based
attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual
understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation
generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these

of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation,

### [57] [Comparative Analysis of Transformer Models in Disaster Tweet Classification for Public Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04650)
*Sharif Noor Zisad,Ragib Hasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了使用Transformer模型（如BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa和DeBERTa）对灾害相关推文进行分类，并与传统机器学习方法进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在理解非正式、隐喻或模糊的语言时常常失败，因此Transformer模型可能更有效。

Method: 评估了包括BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa和DeBERTa在内的Transformer模型在分类灾害相关推文方面的有效性，并与传统机器学习方法进行比较。

Result: BERT达到了最高的准确率（91%），显著优于传统模型，如Logistic Regression和Naive Bayes（均为82%）。

Conclusion: Transformer架构更适合公共安全应用，能够提供更高的准确率、更深入的语言理解和更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real
time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically
classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster
and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for
this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of
words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We
posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than
traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of
transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for
classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional
ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that
BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming
traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The
use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models
to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models
fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far
more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy,
deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world
social media text.

*Ayush Gupta,Ramneet Kaur,Anirban Roy,Adam D. Cobb,Rama Chellappa,Susmit Jha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的推理时 OOD 检测算法，用于检测专业大型语言模型 (LLM)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管通过微调在领域内任务上实现了最先进的性能，但当呈现 OOD 输入时，专业的 LLM 仍然容易出现不正确或不可靠的输出，从而在关键应用中构成风险。

Method: 利用归纳共形异常检测 (ICAD) 框架，使用一种新的基于模型 dropout 容差的非一致性度量。

Result: 通过医学专业 LLM 的实验表明，该方法比基线方法更好地检测 OOD 输入，当将 OOD 数据点视为正例，将领域内测试数据点视为负例时，AUROC 提高了 $2\%$ 到 $37\%。

Conclusion: 该方法利用了 LLM 中的多义性和冗余性的最新发现，我们假设领域内输入比 OOD 输入表现出更高的 dropout 容差。

Abstract: We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for
specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art
performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain
vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs,
posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive
Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity
measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on
polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs
exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout
tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving
detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD.
Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD
inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$
when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as
negatives.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何提高手语识别模型对未见过的手语的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手语数据集在词汇方面不具有代表性，因此模型需要推广到未见过的手语。

Method: 本文研究了两种语音归纳偏置：参数解耦（一种架构偏置）和语音半监督（一种正则化技术），以改进已知手语的孤立手语识别和使用向量量化自动编码器重建未见过的手语的质量。

Result: 结果表明，与受控基线相比，所提出的模型学习到的表示对于未见过的手语的单样本重建更有效，并且对于手语识别更具区分性。

Conclusion: 本文对显式的、语言动机的偏置如何提高手语学习表示的泛化能力进行了定量分析。

Abstract: Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary,
underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector
quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like
representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units
capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This
work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement,
an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization
technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and
reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The
primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are
more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more
discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This
work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated
biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign
language.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面评估了阿拉伯语和多语种LLM在两个关键的阿拉伯语自然语言生成任务（生成式问答和摘要）中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多语种和阿拉伯语专用LLM的数量不断增长，但在阿拉伯语环境中评估LLM的幻觉问题仍相对未被充分探索。鉴于阿拉伯语在许多地区的广泛使用及其在全球通信和媒体中的重要性，这一知识差距尤其紧迫。

Method: 开发了一个细粒度的幻觉评估框架，该框架由12个细粒度的幻觉指标组成，这些指标代表每个任务的不同特征。评估了总共12个LLM，包括4个阿拉伯语预训练模型，4个多语种模型和4个基于推理的模型。

Result: 事实性幻觉比所有模型和任务中的忠实性错误更为普遍。值得注意的是，阿拉伯语预训练模型Allam始终表现出比多语种模型更低的幻觉率，并且与基于推理的模型相比具有可比的性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了阿拉伯语LLM中幻觉问题的严重性，并为未来开发更可靠的阿拉伯语LLM铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language
models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing
number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination
in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is
particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its
importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first
comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two
critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question
answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs,
including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4
reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of
LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework
consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the
varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual
hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models
and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently
demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a
comparative performance with reasoning-based models. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 本文旨在解决真实场景下的图像内多语言机器翻译问题，提出了PRIM数据集和VisTrans模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端图像内机器翻译研究主要基于合成数据，与真实场景存在差距。

Method: 本文构建了包含真实场景图像的PRIM数据集，并提出了一个端到端模型VisTrans，该模型可以分离处理图像中的视觉文本和背景信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，VisTrans模型在翻译质量和视觉效果方面均优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 本文提出的PRIM数据集和VisTrans模型可以有效解决真实场景下的图像内多语言机器翻译问题。

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts
from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly
conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text
position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world,
causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To
facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical
In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the
lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains
real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various
fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation
directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of
practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background
information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual
translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate
the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared
to other models. The code and dataset are available at:

*Adam Tauman Kalai,Ofir Nachum,Santosh S. Vempala,Edwin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在不确定时会猜测，产生看似合理但不正确的陈述，从而产生幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型产生幻觉是因为训练和评估过程奖励猜测而不是承认不确定性。

Method: 分析了现代训练管道中幻觉的统计原因，并认为幻觉源于二元分类中的错误。

Result: 如果无法区分不正确的陈述和事实，那么预训练语言模型中的幻觉将通过自然统计压力产生。

Conclusion: 通过修改现有基准的评分来解决这个问题，而不是引入额外的幻觉评估。

Abstract: Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes
guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of
admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art
systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because
the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging
uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the
modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they
originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements
cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language
models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that
hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language
models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain
improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses
can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the
scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards,
rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may
steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: 知识图谱在许多人工智能应用中至关重要，但保持其新鲜度和完整性仍然代价高昂。

Method: ODKE+结合模块化组件到一个可扩展的流水线中：(1) 提取启动器检测缺失或过时的事实，(2)证据检索器收集支持文档，(3) 混合知识提取器应用基于模式的规则和本体引导的提示用于大型语言模型 (LLM)，(4) 轻量级 Grounder 使用第二个 LLM 验证提取的事实，以及 (5) 协同器对候选事实进行排名和标准化以供摄取。

Result: ODKE+处理超过 900 万个维基百科页面，并摄取 1900 万个高可信度的事实，精度为 98.8%。ODKE+ 显着提高了对传统方法的覆盖率，与第三方 KG 的重叠率高达 48%，并将更新延迟平均减少了 50 天。

Conclusion: 基于本体结构和验证工作流程的基于 LLM 的提取可以提供可信赖的、生产规模的知识摄取，具有广泛的实际适用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but
maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+,
a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of
open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular
components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects
missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting
documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and
ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight
Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator
ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates
ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema
constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195
predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9
million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with
98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional
methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update
lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based
extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can
deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad
real-world applicability. A recording of the system demonstration is included

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology to extract important
patient information from clinical narratives to support healthcare
applications. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has
revolutionized many NLP tasks in the clinical domain, yet their optimal use in
patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration. This study
examines LLMs' effectiveness in patient information extraction, focusing on LLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and multi-task instruction tuning
techniques for developing robust and generalizable patient information
extraction systems. This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for
clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or
decoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
algorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning
performance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs
(BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1,
GatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size
fine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning
framework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the
zero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out
strategy.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在准确回答复杂问题方面一直面临挑战。

Method: 利用LLAMA3模型，系统地研究了知识图谱中多跳问题分解对模型理解和推理准确性的影响。将MQUAKE-T数据集分割成单跳和多跳两种格式，并使用LoRA方法对LLAMA3模型进行微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，在未对LLM进行微调的情况下，基于多跳问题分解方法的预测性能显著优于直接回答复杂问题的方法。经过微调后，两种方法的性能均优于未训练的基线，但多跳分解方法始终保持其优越性。

Conclusion: 研究结果验证了多跳分解方法在训练前后均能有效提高LLM回答复杂问题的能力。

Abstract: Accurately answering complex questions has consistently been a significant
challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, this paper
proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions,
building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model,
we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition
within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both
before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically
partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a
single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a
multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition
method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted
inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the
prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method
significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions.
After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance
of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the
method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its
superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop
decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its
capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex
questions.

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) understand humor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in LLMs have shown impressive performance in various NLP tasks, but it's unclear if they truly understand the content they generate, especially nuanced themes like humor.

Method: The authors fine-tuned a decoder model (GPT-4o) and compared its performance to a fine-tuned encoder model (RoBERTa) on a humor understanding task.

Result: The fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) achieved a Mean F1-macro score of 0.85, comparable to the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa) with a Mean F1-score of 0.86.

Conclusion: The study suggests that fine-tuned decoder models can perform as well as encoder models in understanding humor.

Abstract: From the dawn of the computer, Allen Turing dreamed of a robot that could
communicate using language as a human being. The recent advances in the field
of Large Language Models (LLMs) shocked the scientific community when a single
model can apply for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, while the
output results are sometimes even better than most human communication skills.
Models such as GPT, Claude, Grok, etc. have left their mark on the scientific
community. However, it is unclear how much these models understand what they
produce, especially in a nuanced theme such as humor. The question of whether
computers understand humor is still open (among the decoders, the latest to be
checked was GPT-2). We addressed this issue in this paper; we have showed that
a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) performed (Mean F1-macro score of 0.85) as well
as the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa with a Mean of F1-score 0.86)

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为DQO的新训练方法，该方法基于行列式点过程（DPPs），用于联合优化LLM的质量和语义多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在增强多样性方面受到限制，要么在推理时操作，要么侧重于词汇差异。模型在下游任务上的性能提高，但通常会降低模型输出的多样性，从而导致狭窄的规范响应。

Method: 该方法对每个prompt采样并嵌入一组响应，然后使用基于核的相似度矩阵的行列式来测量多样性，作为这些响应嵌入所跨越的体积。

Result: 在指令跟随、摘要、故事生成和推理任务上的实验表明，该方法在不牺牲模型质量的前提下，大大提高了语义多样性。

Conclusion: DQO方法有效地提高了大型语言模型（LLM）的语义多样性，同时保持了模型质量。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for
post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's
performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output
diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance
diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on
lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on
determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and
semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for
each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to
measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses.
Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and
reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic
diversity without sacrificing model quality.

TL;DR: 本研究系统地研究了大型语言模型（LLM）中的人格控制，比较了上下文学习（ICL）、参数高效微调（PEFT）和机制引导（MS）三种方法，揭示了它们在性能、能力和鲁棒性方面的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在客户服务和代理场景中，大型语言模型（LLM）的人格操纵应用越来越广泛，但其机制和权衡仍不清楚。

Method: 1. 构建了一个具有平衡的高/低特质反应的对比数据集，以实现有效的steering vector计算和公平的跨方法评估。
2. 引入了一个统一的评估框架，该框架基于run内$\\Delta$分析，可以分离MMLU、GAIA和BBQ基准测试中的推理能力、代理性能和人口统计偏差。
3. 开发了特质提纯技术，以区分开放性和责任心，从而解决了特质编码中的表征重叠问题。
4. 提出了一个三级稳定性框架，该框架可以量化方法、特质和组合级别的鲁棒性，从而在部署约束下提供实用的指导。

Result: ICL在最小的能力损失下实现了强大的对齐，PEFT以降低任务性能为代价实现了最高的对齐，而MS以具有竞争力的有效性提供了轻量级的运行时控制。特质水平分析表明，开放性具有独特的挑战性，宜人性最能抵抗ICL，并且人格编码会在中间层附近巩固。

Conclusion: 人格操纵是对行为表征的多层次探测，将表面条件、参数编码和激活水平引导联系起来，并将机制引导定位为微调的一种轻量级替代方案，适用于部署和可解释性。

Abstract: Personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
applied in customer service and agentic scenarios, yet its mechanisms and
trade-offs remain unclear. We present a systematic study of personality control
using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL),
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our
contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with
balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector
computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified
evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles,
reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU,
GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to
separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap
in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that
quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering
practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT
and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment
with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost
of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with
competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely
challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding
consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results
establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral
representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and
activation-level steering, and positioning mechanistic steering as a
lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人工撰写的内容稀缺，大型语言模型越来越多地依赖合成数据。然而，在模型生成的输出上进行递归训练会导致模型崩溃，这是一个威胁事实可靠性的退化过程。

Method: 通过受控实验和递归合成训练，证明了崩溃轨迹和时间依赖于指令格式。提出领域特定的合成训练作为一种有针对性的缓解策略。

Result: 领域特定的合成训练在保持计算效率的同时，在抵抗崩溃方面取得了显著的改进。评估框架将以模型为中心的指标与以任务为中心的指标相结合，以检测不同的退化阶段。

Conclusion: 这些发现为知识密集型应用中可持续的AI训练提供了理论见解和实践指导，在这些应用中，准确性至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models increasingly rely on synthetic data due to
human-written content scarcity, yet recursive training on model-generated
outputs leads to model collapse, a degenerative process threatening factual
reliability. We define knowledge collapse as a distinct three-stage phenomenon
where factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating
"confidently wrong" outputs that pose critical risks in accuracy-dependent
domains. Through controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, we
demonstrate that collapse trajectory and timing depend critically on
instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from
traditional model collapse through its conditional, prompt-dependent nature. We
propose domain-specific synthetic training as a targeted mitigation strategy
that achieves substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our evaluation framework combines model-centric
indicators with task-centric metrics to detect distinct degradation phases,
enabling reproducible assessment of epistemic deterioration across different
language models. These findings provide both theoretical insights into collapse
dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in
knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount.

TL;DR: AgentSeer是一个基于可观察性的评估框架，用于评估代理系统的安全风险，通过将代理执行分解为细粒度的动作和组件图，实现系统的代理情境评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全评估框架在评估特定部署的风险方面存在关键差距，尤其是在大型语言模型转变为代理系统时。

Method: 提出了AgentSeer框架，该框架将代理执行分解为细粒度的动作和组件图，以实现系统的代理情境评估。通过在GPT-OSS-20B和Gemini-2.0-flash上使用HarmBench单轮和迭代优化攻击进行跨模型验证。

Result: 模型层面的评估显示，GPT-OSS-20B的攻击成功率为39.47%，而Gemini-2.0-flash为50.00%。代理层面的评估揭示了传统的评估方法无法发现的代理特定风险，工具调用在两个模型上的攻击成功率高出24-60%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，迫切需要代理情境评估范式，AgentSeer提供了标准化的方法和实证验证。

Abstract: As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety
evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific
risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that
decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs,
enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model
validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and
iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between
model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation
reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash
(50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering
while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level
assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We
discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic
contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models.
Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer
operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability
mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside
model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection
strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows
degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash:
28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives
that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These
findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms,
with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

### [72] [Analyzing Finnish Inflectional Classes through Discriminative Lexicon and Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04813)
*Alexandre Nikolaev,Yu-Ying Chuang,R. Harald Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了屈折类在母语者学习语言中的认知真实性，通过使用区分性词典模型(DLM)对芬兰语名词进行研究，检验了该模型在不建立屈折类的情况下理解和生成屈折名词的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 屈折类在描述复杂的名词或动词系统时非常有用，但目前尚不清楚屈折类是否具有认知真实性，即母语者是否需要发现这些类才能正确地屈折其语言中的名词。

Method: 研究使用包含来自49个屈折类的2000个高频芬兰语名词的55,271个屈折名词的数据集，建立了多个DLM理解和生成模型。一些模型未被告知使用频率，而另一些模型则从基于使用的角度进行设置，并在训练时考虑了token频率。

Result: 在训练数据上，模型表现出非常高的准确率。对于保留的测试数据，准确率有所下降，但仍可接受。对于大多数模型，对于具有更多类型、更多较低频率单词和更多hapax legomena的屈折类，性能有所提高，这反映了屈折类的生产力。该模型在处理非生产性和生产力较低的类的新形式时更加困难，并且对于属于生产类的未见形式表现更好。然而，对于基于使用的生产模型，频率是模型性能的主要预测指标，并且与生产力指标的相关性很弱或不存在。

Conclusion: DLM模型能够在不依赖显式屈折类的情况下，有效地学习和处理芬兰语名词的屈折变化。频率在模型性能中起着重要作用，尤其是在基于使用的模型中。

Abstract: Descriptions of complex nominal or verbal systems make use of inflectional
classes. Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem
changes and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional
classes can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up
finite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes
are cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover
these classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their
language. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model
(DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up
inflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000
high-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM
comprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed
about frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite
exposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based
perspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into
consideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed
with very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as
expected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased
for inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more
hapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The
model struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive
classes, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive
classes. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant
predictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity
were tenuous or absent.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了自动驾驶汽车中信任和感知安全的重要性，发现动态驾驶风格和行人过马路会增加不适感。面部表情识别并不适用于评估感知风险，但基于车辆运动和皮肤电导的神经网络模型可以有效预测感知风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解公众对自动驾驶汽车的接受度，以及信任和感知安全在其中的作用。

Method: 通过驾驶模拟器实验，研究两种自动驾驶风格（动态和冷静）以及行人出现情况对32名参与者的影响。收集了主观舒适度评分、运动数据、面部表情、皮肤电导、心率和眼动追踪数据。

Result: 动态驾驶风格比冷静驾驶风格引起更强的不适感；行人过马路在动态驾驶风格下会加剧不适感。面部表情识别不适用于评估感知风险。基于车辆运动和皮肤电导的神经网络模型与报告的感知风险相关性良好。

Conclusion: 感知风险评估中，车辆运动和皮肤电导数据具有潜力，可用于客观评估，减少主观偏差，并为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer是一个prompt重写框架，旨在提升文本到图像(T2I)模型生成图像与用户意图的对齐度，无需修改T2I模型的权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型在处理复杂用户prompt时，如属性绑定、否定和组合关系，难以准确呈现，导致用户意图与生成结果不匹配。

Method: 提出PromptEnhancer框架，通过强化学习训练一个Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 重写器，该重写器由一个名为AlignEvaluator的奖励模型引导，AlignEvaluator基于对常见T2I失败模式的系统分析，提供细粒度的反馈。

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的大量实验表明，PromptEnhancer显著提高了图像-文本对齐，并引入了一个新的高质量人类偏好基准。

Conclusion: PromptEnhancer通过优化CoT重写器，使其能够生成更精确地被T2I模型解释的prompt，从而提升生成图像与用户意图的对齐度。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext是一个基于SD3.5-Medium的2B参数DiT模型，它在图像生成和编辑方面达到了最先进的水平，并无缝扩展到统一的多模态框架中。


<details>

Motivation: 现有开源模型侧重于扩展模型参数而不是优化训练策略，限制了它们的效率和性能。本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 1. 对SD3.5-Medium进行架构修改，并在高质量数据上进行大规模预训练，实现联合文本到图像的生成和编辑功能。
2. 提出了一种新的渐进式双任务强化策略（PDTR），有效地加强了阶段性任务。
3. 通过MetaQuery连接UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext和Qwen2.5-VL-7B，并进行联合训练以启动统一的多模态模型UniPic2-Metaquery。

Result: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext在图像生成和编辑能力上优于具有更大生成参数的模型，包括BAGEL (7B) 和 Flux-Kontext (12B)。UniPic2-Metaquery在各种任务中实现了顶级的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了所提出的训练范式的有效性和通用性，并将其正式化为Skywork UniPic 2.0。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

TL;DR: 提出了 Inpaint4Drag 框架，用于实时、精确的图像拖拽编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖生成模型的潜在空间，导致精度有限、反馈延迟和模型特定约束。

Method: 将拖拽编辑分解为像素空间双向变形和图像修复，模拟物理世界中的弹性物体变形。

Result: 实现了 512x512 分辨率下实时变形预览（0.01 秒）和高效图像修复（0.3 秒），显著提升了交互体验。作为通用适配器，可用于任何图像修复模型。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了卓越的视觉质量和精确控制，同时保持实时性能。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于扩散模型的对抗补丁防御框架DISPATCH，用于目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的目标检测器容易受到对抗补丁攻击，这些攻击会隐藏或创建物体，理想的防御方法应有效、通用且对自适应攻击具有鲁棒性。

Method: DISPATCH采用“再生和纠正”策略，利用扩散模型的生成能力来再生整个图像，然后识别对抗区域并用再生的良性区域替换它们。

Result: DISPATCH在隐藏攻击和创建攻击方面始终优于最先进的防御方法，在隐藏攻击上实现了89.3%的最佳mAP.5分数，并将非目标创建攻击的攻击成功率降低到24.8%。

Conclusion: DISPATCH对自适应攻击具有很强的鲁棒性，使其成为目标检测系统的一种实用且可靠的防御方法。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

TL;DR: WATCH: A unified framework for global human motion reconstruction from monocular videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates is challenging due to depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement between camera and human movements. Existing human-motion-centric approaches have limitations in exploiting camera orientation and integrating camera translation cues.

Method: Introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique and a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction on in-the-wild benchmarks.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships is effective and offers new insights for addressing camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction.

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

Motivation: 现有密集视频字幕模型存在两个局限性：仅对文本应用时间戳监督而平等对待所有视频帧，以及从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换。

Method: 提出了Sali4Vid框架，包括显着性感知视频重加权（将时间戳注释转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重）和基于语义的自适应字幕检索（通过帧相似性分割视频以捕获场景转换并改进字幕检索）。

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 证明了联合改进视频加权和检索对于密集视频字幕的好处。

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,

TL;DR: VCMamba, a new vision backbone, combines CNNs and Mamba SSMs to capture both local and global features efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs lack global reasoning, while ViTs and Mamba struggle with fine-grained local features. VCMamba bridges this gap.

Method: A hybrid architecture with convolutional blocks for local feature extraction and multi-directional Mamba blocks for long-range dependencies.

Result: VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and 47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, outperforming existing models with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: VCMamba's hybrid design enables superior feature representation with linear complexity.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体、免训练的框架，用于在现实世界的应用中进行语义分割，该框架可以协调通用视觉语言模型，在迭代的 Worker-Supervisor 细化架构中工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中的语义分割不仅需要精确的掩码，还需要严格遵守文本标签指南。这些指南通常很复杂且很长，人工和自动标签都常常无法忠实地遵循它们。传统方法依赖于昂贵的、特定于任务的再训练，并且必须随着指南的演变而重复进行。

Method: 引入了一种多智能体、免训练的框架，该框架在迭代的 Worker-Supervisor 细化架构中协调通用视觉语言模型。Worker 执行分割，Supervisor 根据检索到的指南进行批评，轻量级强化学习停止策略决定何时终止循环，确保指南一致的掩码，同时平衡资源使用。

Result: 在 Waymo 和 ReasonSeg 数据集上进行评估，该方法明显优于最先进的基线，证明了强大的泛化能力和指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在语义分割任务中，能够更好地遵循复杂的文本标签指南，并在泛化能力和指令遵循方面表现出色。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art

### [83] [Domain Adaptation for Different Sensor Configurations in 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04711)
*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文着眼于自动驾驶中不同激光雷达配置的三维物体检测模型适应问题，提出了下游微调和部分层微调两种技术以提升跨配置泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同车辆平台部署不同的传感器配置，导致模型在不同配置上表现下降。以往的三维物体检测多数据集训练和领域自适应主要解决环境领域差距和单个激光雷达内的密度变化，而不同传感器配置的领域差距仍未被探索。

Method: 提出下游微调（多数据集训练后进行数据集特定微调）和部分层微调（仅更新一部分层以提升跨配置泛化能力）两种技术。

Result: 使用在同一地理区域采集的、具有多种传感器配置的配对数据集，结果表明，联合下游微调和部分层微调的联合训练始终优于每个配置的简单联合训练。

Conclusion: 研究结果为将三维物体检测模型适配到不同的车辆平台提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CD-Mamba, a hybrid model combining CNNs and Mamba for improved cloud detection in remote sensing images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud cover in remote sensing images hinders data integrity. Existing methods struggle to capture both local spatial redundancies and long-range atmospheric similarities.

Method: The paper proposes CD-Mamba, which integrates convolutional neural networks and Mamba's state-space modeling.

Result: Experiments demonstrate CD-Mamba's effectiveness and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CD-Mamba effectively captures both pixel-wise interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies, improving detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales.

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

*Shengqian Zhu,Jiafei Wu,Xiaogang Xu,Chengrong Yu,Ying Song,Zhang Yi,Guangjun Li,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于解决医学图像分割中类别不平衡问题的Task Consistency Training (TCT) 框架，该框架利用多任务学习和一致性约束，无需额外模型且能有效利用未标记的解剖结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于获取所有类别的完整标注通常不切实际，因此利用部分标注数据集 (PLD) 成为一种有前景的替代方案。然而，由于 PLD 中类别分布不均，当前的 VMIS 方法面临着严重的类别不平衡问题。现有方法试图通过生成伪完整标签来解决这个问题，但这通常需要额外的模型，并且常常会导致标签噪声带来的潜在性能下降。

Method: 本文引入了 Task Consistency Training (TCT) 框架，包括一个带有用于多通道预测的主分割头 (MSH) 的骨干网络和多个用于特定任务预测的辅助任务头 (ATH)。通过在 MSH 和 ATH 预测之间实施一致性约束，TCT 有效地利用了未标记的解剖结构。为了避免来自低一致性、潜在噪声数据的误差传播，我们提出了一种过滤策略来排除此类数据。此外，我们引入了一种统一的辅助不确定性加权损失 (UAUWL) 来减轻由特定任务的主导地位造成的分割质量下降。

Result: 在来自不同临床站点的八个腹部数据集上的大量实验证明了我们方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TCT 框架有效地解决了医学图像分割中类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型且能有效利用未标记的解剖结构。

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉基础模型（如SAM和SAM2）在一般图像分割基准测试中表现出色，但在恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，因为它们缺乏不确定性量化。本文通过引入不确定性指标到损失函数中的多步微调程序和将UAT适配到驾驶环境，来提高自动驾驶的分割鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型在恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，因为它们缺乏不确定性量化。为了提高自动驾驶在恶劣天气下的安全性，需要提高分割鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 引入多步微调程序，将不确定性指标直接纳入损失函数，改进整体场景识别。2. 将最初为医学图像分割设计的UAT适配到驾驶环境。

Result: UAT-SAM在极端天气下优于标准SAM，而具有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在不同的驾驶场景中实现了改进的性能。

Conclusion: 显式不确定性建模对于在具有挑战性的环境中进行安全关键的自动驾驶具有重要价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

Motivation: 在实际和多模态细粒度人体活动识别 (HAR) 方面取得了进展，但在不受约束的环境中完全在智能手表上运行的系统仍然难以实现。本研究旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 通过优化管道的每个组件，WatchHAR 实现了复合性能提升。我们引入了一种新颖的架构，该架构将传感器数据预处理和推理统一到一个端到端可训练模块中。

Result: WatchHAR 在事件检测和活动分类方面优于最先进的模型，同时直接在智能手表上运行，活动事件检测的处理时间为 9.3 毫秒，多模态活动分类的处理时间为 11.8 毫秒，同时在超过 25 个活动类别中保持 90% 以上的准确率，处理速度提高了 5 倍。

Conclusion: 这项研究推进了设备上的活动识别，实现了智能手表作为独立的、具有隐私意识的和最小侵入性的连续活动跟踪设备的潜力。

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity
Recognition (HAR), a system that runs entirely on smartwatches in unconstrained
environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component
of the pipeline, WatchHAR achieves compounding performance gains. We introduce
a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while
maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MCANet的多标签分类框架，用于快速准确地进行飓风灾后评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CNN的方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，并且难以区分视觉上相似或同时发生的损伤类型。

Method: 采用基于Res2Net的分层骨干网络来丰富跨尺度的空间上下文，并采用多头类特定的残差注意力模块来增强判别能力。

Result: 在飓风“迈克尔”之后收集的4,494张无人机图像的RescueNet数据集上，MCANet实现了91.75%的平均精度均值（mAP），优于ResNet、Res2Net、VGG、MobileNet、EfficientNet和ViT。

Conclusion: MCANet的输出可以为灾后风险 mapping、应急routing和基于数字孪生的灾害响应提供信息。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种视频中动态人群检测方法，通过结合局部外观特征和全局场景上下文来检测复杂人群。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测复杂人群需要考虑群体成员的局部外观特征和全局场景上下文。

Method: 使用视觉-语言模型（VLM）提取局部和全局外观特征，并通过图优化实现动态变化人群的检测。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在公共数据集上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地检测视频中动态变化的人群。

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

TL;DR: FloodVision是一个零样本框架，它结合了GPT-4o的语义推理能力和结构化领域知识图谱，以实现准确的洪水深度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算机视觉方法在洪水检测方面存在准确性限制和泛化性差的问题，因为它们依赖于固定的物体检测器和特定于任务的训练。

Method: FloodVision动态识别RGB图像中可见的参考物体，从知识图谱中检索经过验证的高度以减少幻觉，估计淹没率，并应用统计异常值过滤来计算最终深度值。

Result: 在来自MyCoast New York的110张众包图像上进行评估，FloodVision实现了8.17厘米的平均绝对误差，比GPT-4o基线降低了10.28厘米，降低了20.5%，超过了以前基于CNN的方法。

Conclusion: 该系统在不同的场景中具有良好的泛化性，并且以接近实时的速度运行，使其适合未来集成到数字孪生平台和智能城市防洪的公民报告应用程序中。

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的方法，双塔框架效果不佳，而单塔框架效率较低。为了解决这个问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的混合方法，即用于T2VR的细粒度伪查询交互和生成(PIG)。PIG包括一个为每个视频生成伪查询的新型伪查询生成器，使视频特征和伪查询的文本特征以细粒度的方式进行交互。

Result: 在五个常用的文本视频检索基准测试中，该方法相对于基线有了显著的改进，R@1提高了$1.6\%\sim3.9\%。

Conclusion: 该方法在达到接近最先进性能的同时，与双塔模型具有相同的效率，突出了混合塔框架的优势。

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Motivation: 为了提高低分辨率图像的质量，特别是在医学影像领域。

Method: 使用MSSEG2挑战数据集中的高分辨率(HR) FLAIR MRI训练和验证MLP-SRGAN。该方法应用于三个多中心FLAIR数据集(CAIN, ADNI, CCNA)，这些数据集在切片维度上具有低空间分辨率的图像，以检查在保留的(未见过的)临床数据上的性能。

Conclusion: MLP-SRGAN在超分辨率重建方面优于现有方法，并且具有更高的效率和更小的模型尺寸。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture called MLP-SRGAN, which is a single-dimension
Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) that utilizes
Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers (MLP-Mixers) along with convolutional layers to
upsample in the slice direction. MLP-SRGAN is trained and validated using high
resolution (HR) FLAIR MRI from the MSSEG2 challenge dataset. The method was
applied to three multicentre FLAIR datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA) of images with
low spatial resolution in the slice dimension to examine performance on
held-out (unseen) clinical data. Upsampled results are compared to several
state-of-the-art SR networks. For images with high resolution (HR) ground
truths, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index
(SSIM) are used to measure upsampling performance. Several new structural,
no-reference image quality metrics were proposed to quantify sharpness (edge
strength), noise (entropy), and blurriness (low frequency information) in the
absence of ground truths. Results show MLP-SRGAN results in sharper edges, less
blurring, preserves more texture and fine-anatomical detail, with fewer
parameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size than
existing methods. Code for MLP-SRGAN training and inference, data generators,
models and no-reference image quality metrics will be available at

Conclusion: 结果表明，对于在不同条件下实现鲁棒的月球图像配准，预处理和基于学习的方法非常重要。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

Method: 本文研究了三种从MoE中提取预测不确定性估计的方法：预测熵、互信息和专家方差。使用在A2D2数据集的语义分割上训练的具有两个专家的MoE评估这些方法。此外，还评估了通过门控熵计算的路由不确定性，并研究了不同门控机制的影响。最后，在Cityscapes数据集上进行了实验，以探索增加专家数量对不确定性校准的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，在分布外(OOD)数据下，MoE在条件正确性指标方面比集成方法产生更可靠的不确定性估计。简单的门控机制比更复杂的类相关门控产生更好的路由不确定性估计校准。增加专家数量可以进一步提高不确定性校准。

Conclusion: MoE模型可以在不进行架构修改的情况下提取良好校准的预测不确定性估计，并且优于集成方法。简单的门控机制和增加专家数量可以进一步提高不确定性校准。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的轻场图像超分辨率（LFSR）的混合Mamba-Transformer框架，名为LFMT，该框架集成了Mamba和Transformer模型的优势，以实现跨空间、角度和极平面域的全面信息探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多向扫描策略在应用于复杂的轻场数据时，导致低效和冗余的特征提取。

Method: 提出了基于子空间简单扫描（Sub-SS）策略的子空间简单Mamba块（SSMB），并提出了双阶段建模策略，结合空间-角度残差子空间Mamba块（SA-RSMB）、极平面Mamba块（EPMB）和极平面Transformer块（EPTB）。

Result: 实验结果表明，LFMT在LFSR中显著优于当前最先进的方法，在真实和合成轻场数据集上实现了性能的显著提高，同时保持了较低的计算复杂性。

Conclusion: LFMT 是一种有效的轻场图像超分辨率方法，它通过结合 Mamba 和 Transformer 的优势，实现了跨空间、角度和极平面域的全面信息探索。

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

*Ming Dai,Wenxuan Cheng,Jiedong Zhuang,Jiang-jiang Liu,Hongshen Zhao,Zhenhua Feng,Wankou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了PropVG，一个端到端的基于提议的框架，用于视觉定位，它整合了前景对象提议生成和参考对象理解，不需要额外的检测器。此外，它还引入了一个基于对比的参考评分（CRS）模块和一个多粒度目标判别（MTD）模块，以提高理解和区分参考对象的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖于参考目标进行监督，忽略了潜在的前景目标的好处，并且未能纳入多粒度判别，这对于复杂场景中的鲁棒对象识别至关重要。

Method: 该论文提出了PropVG框架，该框架集成了前景对象提议生成和参考对象理解，无需额外的检测器。它还引入了CRS模块，该模块在句子和单词层面采用对比学习来增强理解能力，以及MTD模块，该模块融合了对象和语义层面的信息，以提高对不存在目标的识别。

Result: 在gRefCOCO、Ref-ZOM、R-RefCOCO和RefCOCO基准上的大量实验证明了PropVG的有效性。

Conclusion: PropVG框架在视觉定位任务中表现出色，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and
models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/PropVG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了TemporalFlowViz，一个参数感知的可视化分析工作流程和系统，旨在支持专家驱动的超燃冲压发动机燃烧模拟的时间流场聚类、可视化和解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解超燃冲压发动机内复杂的燃烧动态对于推进高速推进技术至关重要。然而，模拟生成的时间流场数据的大规模和高维度给视觉解释、特征区分和跨案例比较带来了重大挑战。

Method: 该方法利用数百个具有不同初始条件的模拟燃烧案例，每个案例都产生时间序列的流场图像。使用预训练的视觉Transformer从这些帧中提取高维嵌入，应用降维和基于密度的聚类来发现潜在的燃烧模式，并构建嵌入空间中的时间轨迹来跟踪每个模拟随时间的演变。

Result: 通过两个专家案例研究和专家反馈证明了TemporalFlowViz的有效性，展示了TemporalFlowViz增强了假设生成，支持可解释的模式发现，并增强了大规模超燃冲压发动机燃烧分析中的知识发现。

Conclusion: TemporalFlowViz系统通过参数过滤、基于相似性的案例检索和协调的多视图探索来促进深入分析，从而弥合潜在表示和专家推理之间的差距。

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OmniFHT的无姿态3D折射率重建框架，用于高通量流式细胞术断层成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成像方法假设细胞进行均匀的单轴旋转，这限制了其对近球形细胞的适用性，并阻止了对具有复杂旋转的不规则形状细胞的准确成像。因此，只能分析细胞群的一部分，限制了基于流动的测定执行稳健的统计分析的能力。

Method: 利用傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示（INR），共同优化每个细胞的未知旋转轨迹和体结构，在弱散射假设下进行。

Result: OmniFHT支持任意细胞几何形状和多轴旋转。它的连续表示还允许从稀疏采样的投影和受限的角度覆盖进行准确重建，以低至10个视图或仅120度的角度范围产生高保真结果。

Conclusion: OmniFHT首次实现了对整个流动细胞群的原位、高通量断层成像，为流式细胞术平台中的无标记形态分析提供了一种可扩展且无偏的解决方案。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoRe-GS的方法，用于加速移动机器人上的特定目标三维重建，该方法通过结合语义高斯溅射和颜色滤波，在保证重建质量的同时，显著减少了训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动机器人应用中，对特定目标进行快速准确的三维重建至关重要，但传统方法需要对整个场景进行详细重建，效率较低。

Method: 首先使用语义高斯溅射生成粗略的场景，然后使用颜色滤波细化特定目标的重建效果。

Result: 在SCRREAM和NeRDS 360数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够减少训练时间并提高新视角合成的质量。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS方法能够有效平衡重建质量和训练时间，适用于移动机器人上的目标三维重建任务。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的Cryo-RL框架，用于优化前列腺癌冷冻消融治疗中的冷冻探针放置，旨在提高治疗效果并减少人工 planning 的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前冷冻消融 planning 依赖人工，耗时且质量不稳定，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 将冷冻消融 planning 建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用强化学习学习最优的冷冻探针放置策略。模拟临床约束和随机术中变异性，agent 顺序选择冷冻探针位置和冰球直径，并通过基于肿瘤覆盖率的奖励函数进行引导。

Result: 在 583 个回顾性前列腺癌病例的评估中，Cryo-RL 比最佳自动化基线（基于几何优化）提高了超过 8 个百分点的 Dice 系数，并且在 planning 时间大大减少的情况下达到了人类专家的性能。

Conclusion: 强化学习有潜力提供临床可行、可重复且高效的冷冻消融 planning。

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Motivation: 为开发自适应系统，研究计算机视觉模型是否能准确预测蜘蛛图像引起的恐惧水平。

Method: 采用迁移学习调整三个不同的模型，使用包含 313 张图像的标准数据集预测人类恐惧评级（0-100）。通过交叉验证评估模型。

Result: 模型平均绝对误差（MAE）在 10.1 和 11.0 之间。数据集大小对性能有显著影响，模型预测基于蜘蛛相关特征。远距离视图和人工/绘画蜘蛛图像的误差较高。

Conclusion: 计算机视觉模型在预测恐惧评级方面具有潜力，模型可解释性和足够的数据集大小对开发有效的情感感知治疗技术至关重要。

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Conclusion: 该方法是可定制的，并且可以轻松扩展到其他工业磨损检测场景。

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision

an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于注意力机制的多示例学习 (MIL) 框架，用于皮脂细胞图像分析，旨在解决人工计数皮脂细胞内脂滴费时费力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工计数皮脂细胞内的脂滴是一项劳动密集且主观的任务，因此需要自动化的解决方案。

Method: 本文构建了一个基于注意力机制的 MIL 模型，并与基于聚合patch级别计数的基线多层感知器 (MLP) 模型进行了比较。使用 Nile Red 染色的皮脂细胞图像，并根据液滴计数将其注释为 14 个类别，通过数据增强扩展到大约 50,000 个细胞。

Result: 实验结果表明，基线 MLP 实现了更稳定的性能 (平均 MAE = 5.6)，而基于注意力的 MIL 模型不太稳定 (平均 MAE = 10.7)，但在特定 folds 中偶尔表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，简单的 bag 级别聚合为 slide 级别的液滴计数提供了稳健的基线，而基于注意力的 MIL 需要任务对齐的 pooling 和正则化，以充分发挥其在皮脂细胞图像分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 UniView 模型，利用参考图像提供先验信息以合成新视角，减少图像扭曲。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单张图像合成新视角是病态问题，现有方法易产生扭曲。

Method: 构建检索增强系统，用多模态大语言模型 (MLLM) 选择参考图像，引入多层隔离的即插即用适配器模块生成参考特征，设计解耦三重注意力机制。

Result: UniView 显著提升了新视角合成性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniView 在新视角合成任务上表现出色。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的V2A生成方法，该方法利用多个基础模型映射器（MFM-Mapper）融合来自双视觉编码器的特征，并通过GPT-2改进特征对齐，从而提高了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频到音频生成方法训练成本高昂，因此利用基础模型进行跨模态知识迁移和泛化变得越来越重要。

Method: 使用双视觉编码器融合特征，并用GPT-2替换线性映射器以改进特征对齐。

Result: MFM-Mapper在语义和时间一致性方面表现更好，训练效率更高，仅需先前基于映射器的工作16%的训练规模，即可与大规模训练的模型竞争。

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper 具有显著的训练效率，并在语义和时间一致性方面表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外-可见光图像融合 (IVIF) 方法假设高质量的输入，难以处理双源退化场景，并且需要手动选择和顺序应用多个预增强步骤，导致误差累积和性能下降。

Method: 该框架集成了视觉-语言模型 (VLM) 用于退化感知，并结合了双域（频率/空间）联合优化。GFMSE 模块执行频域退化感知和抑制，并提取融合相关的子带特征。GSMAF 模块在空间域中进行跨模态退化过滤和自适应多源特征聚合。

Result: GD^2Fusion 在双源退化场景中实现了优于现有算法和策略的融合性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的红外-可见光图像融合框架，可以有效解决双源退化场景下的融合问题，并在实验中取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest
accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML
models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical
workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing,
interpretable systems for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection.

*Hulin Li,Qiliang Ren,Jun Li,Hanbing Wei,Zheng Liu,Linfang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个新的低光照交通场景数据集Dark-traffic，并提出了一个名为SLVM的视觉模型，该模型在低光照环境下的目标检测、实例分割和光流估计方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有感知模型难以适应低光照环境，且缺乏专门针对低光照交通场景的大规模基准数据集。

Method: 提出了一个物理上合理的照度退化方法，并构建了Dark-traffic数据集。同时，提出了一个名为SLVM的视觉模型，它包含光线自适应瞳孔机制、特征级可分离学习策略、任务特定解耦分支和空间错位感知融合模块。

Result: SLVM在Dark-traffic数据集上，目标检测性能超过RT-DETR 11.2%，实例分割性能超过YOLOv12 6.1%，光流估计误差降低12.37%。在LIS基准测试中，SLVM的性能也优于其他模型。

Conclusion: SLVM在低光照交通场景中的感知任务上具有优越的性能，并且发布了Dark-traffic数据集和完整代码。

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at
https://github.com/alanli1997/slvm.

Motivation: 解决了计算需求高和数据集稀缺等挑战。

Method: 研究评估了三种TL策略——完全微调、部分微调和从头开始训练——使用了四种轻量级MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, 和 ShuffleNet。

Result: MobileNet成为表现最好的模型，始终如一地实现了卓越的准确性、鲁棒性和效率，而ShuffleNet在泛化方面表现出色，尤其是在完全微调的情况下。IFHCDB数据集产生了最高的结果，在完全微调下使用MnasNet的准确率为99%，突出了其对鲁棒字符识别的适用性。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了结合TL和MbNets在资源高效的AHCR中的潜力，为进一步的优化和更广泛的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with
mobile-enabled convolutional neural networks (MbNets) to enhance Arabic
Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR). Addressing challenges like extensive
computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three
TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from
scratch--using four lightweight MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and
ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will
explore architectural modifications, in-depth dataset feature analysis, data
augmentation, and advanced sensitivity analysis to enhance model robustness and
generalizability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决服装与各种体型对齐的难题。

Method: 该方法将服装到人体的悬垂问题分为两个对应任务：1) 服装到 SMPL 的对应和 2) 身体到 SMPL 的对应。服装到 SMPL 的拟合问题使用基于几何学习的方法，而身体到 SMPL 的对应使用基于扩散模型的方法。

Result: 该系统可以生成高质量的 3D 服装拟合，无需任何人工。

Conclusion: LUIVITON 提供了一个全自动的服装拟合解决方案，支持服装尺寸的快速定制，并且即使在没有 2D 服装缝纫图案的情况下也能有效工作。

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的工业产品检测异常检测框架通常只在无缺陷样本上训练，而利用缺陷样本通常需要像素级注释，限制了可扩展性。

Method: ADClick是一种交互式图像分割（IIS）算法，用于工业异常检测。ADClick-Seg是一种跨模态框架，通过基于原型的方法对齐视觉特征和文本提示，用于异常检测和定位。

Result: ADClick显著提高了AD模型性能（例如，在MVTec AD上，AP = 96.1%）。ADClick-Seg在具有挑战性的“多类”AD任务上实现了最先进的结果（在MVTec AD上，AP = 80.0%，PRO = 97.5%，Pixel-AUROC = 99.1%）。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够利用少量用户点击和文本描述，有效提高工业异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要集中在使用低阶几何先验（例如，法向量），并且它们也通过噪声敏感方法（如局部主成分分析）进行不可靠的估计。

Method: 提出GeoSplat框架，利用一阶和二阶几何量，并引入高效且对噪声鲁棒的估计方法，这些方法为框架提供动态几何先验。

Result: 在多个数据集上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明GeoSplat显着提高了高斯溅射的性能，并且优于先前的基线。

Conclusion: GeoSplat框架有效地利用了几何先验来改进高斯溅射的训练和性能。

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合深度学习架构，即尺度交互Transformer (SIT)，它结合了CNN的特征提取能力和Transformer的关系建模能力，用于自动面部美学预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部美学预测(FBP) 是一项具有挑战性的计算机视觉任务，因为局部和全局面部特征的复杂相互作用会影响人类的感知。卷积神经网络 (CNN) 擅长特征提取，但它们通常以固定的尺度处理信息，可能会忽略不同粒度级别特征之间的关键相互依赖性。

Method: SIT首先采用具有并行卷积的多尺度模块，以捕获不同感受野的面部特征。然后，这些多尺度表示被构架为一个序列，并由Transformer编码器处理，Transformer编码器通过自我注意机制显式地建模它们的交互和上下文关系。

Result: 在广泛使用的SCUT-FBP5500基准数据集上进行了大量实验，所提出的SIT模型建立了一种新的state-of-the-art。它实现了0.9187的皮尔逊相关系数，优于以前的方法。

Conclusion: 显式地建模多尺度视觉线索之间的相互作用对于高性能FBP至关重要。SIT架构的成功突出了混合CNN-Transformer模型在复杂的图像回归任务中的潜力，这些任务需要整体的、上下文感知的理解。

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出使用稀疏混合专家（MoE）层来提高卷积神经网络（CNN）的鲁棒性，以对抗对抗性攻击。通过在ResNet架构中插入MoE层，并在对抗训练中结合使用，可以提高在PGD和AutoPGD攻击下的鲁棒性。研究发现，使用switch loss进行平衡会导致路由崩溃到一小部分过度使用的专家，从而使对抗训练集中在这些路径上，并意外地使它们更加健壮。结果表明，一些个体专家在鲁棒性方面优于门控MoE模型，表明鲁棒子路径通过专业化出现。


<details>

Motivation: 对抗样本使得卷积神经网络的鲁棒性成为一个挑战，并且通常需要资源密集型的对策。

Method: 使用稀疏混合专家（MoE）层替换ResNet中的残差块或卷积层，以提高模型容量，同时不增加额外的推理成本。结合对抗训练和switch loss。

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上，在ResNet架构的更深层阶段插入单个MoE层，结合对抗训练，可以持续提高在PGD和AutoPGD攻击下的鲁棒性。当使用switch loss进行平衡时，路由会崩溃到一小部分过度使用的专家，从而使对抗训练集中在这些路径上，并意外地使它们更加健壮。一些个体专家在鲁棒性方面优于门控MoE模型。

Conclusion: 鲁棒子路径通过专家 специализация 出现。

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT is proposed for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression tasks, which is ubiquitous in biology and medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models do not generalize well to domain-shifted target data. Many domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full access to source data, which is unrealistic in scenarios where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or because it is too large. Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.

Method: CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF), semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. It builds upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA).

Result: CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation models by more than 3%.

Conclusion: CRAFT is an efficient approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于transformer的框架，可以直接从单个图像和网格预测3D纹理场，无需UV映射和可微渲染，从而实现更快的纹理生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成方法速度慢，依赖UV图，并且通常无法保持与参考图像的一致性。

Method: 该方法集成了三平面表示和基于深度的反向投影损失，从而实现高效训练和更快的推理。

Result: 该方法只需一次正向传播即可生成高保真纹理，每个形状仅需0.2秒。大量的定性、定量和用户偏好评估表明，该方法在单图像纹理重建方面优于现有技术水平，在输入图像的保真度和感知质量方面均有优势。

Conclusion: 该方法实用性强，可扩展、高质量且可控，适用于3D内容创作。

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

TL;DR: SGS-3D: A split-then-grow framework refines 3D instance segmentation by purifying lifted masks with geometric primitives and growing them into complete instances, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D-to-3D lifting approaches for 3D instance segmentation suffer from error accumulation, leading to imprecise instance-level segmentation due to ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints.

Method: A novel split-then-grow framework (SGS-3D) is proposed. It splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric primitives and grows them into complete instances. It uses a mask filtering strategy based on 3D geometry primitives for reliable semantic consistency and constructs fine-grained object instances exploiting spatial continuity and high-level features for geometric refinement.

Result: SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360, yielding high-fidelity object instances and strong generalization.

Conclusion: SGS-3D effectively fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective cooperation between the two levels of representation and improving 3D instance segmentation accuracy and robustness in diverse environments.

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于注释数据的稀缺，对比学习等无监督方法在SLR领域很有前景。然而，SLR中的对比学习存在两个问题：(i) 对比学习方法同等对待视频的所有部分，而没有考虑到某些部分的相关性；(ii) 不同符号之间的共享运动使负样本非常相似，从而使符号区分复杂化。

Method: 该框架由两个协同工作的关键组件组成：(i) 一种新的具有自由负样本的自监督方法；(ii) 一种新的数据增强技术。

Result: 该方法在准确性方面显示出显着提高，与线性评估、半监督学习和符号语言之间的可转移性相比，优于几种对比和自监督方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的自监督学习框架，旨在学习有意义的SLR表征。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,

*Mohammad Saeid,Amir Salarpour,Pedram MohajerAnsari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ModelNet-R，一个改进的ModelNet40数据集，并提出了Point-SkipNet，一种轻量级的图神经网络，用于3D点云分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常用的ModelNet40数据集存在标签不一致、2D数据、大小不匹配和类区分不足等问题，阻碍了模型性能。

Method: 本文提出了Point-SkipNet，它利用高效采样、邻域分组和跳跃连接来实现高分类精度，同时降低计算开销。

Result: 在ModelNet-R上训练的模型表现出显著的性能提升。Point-SkipNet在ModelNet-R上实现了最先进的精度，并且参数数量明显低于现有模型。

Conclusion: 数据集质量在优化3D点云分类的模型效率方面起着至关重要的作用。

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used
ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D
data, size mismatches, and inadequate class differentiation, which hinder model
performance. This paper introduces ModelNet-R, a meticulously refined version
of ModelNet40 designed to address these issues and serve as a more reliable
benchmark. Additionally, this paper proposes Point-SkipNet, a lightweight
graph-based neural network that leverages efficient sampling, neighborhood
grouping, and skip connections to achieve high classification accuracy with
reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably,
Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a
substantially lower parameter count compared to contemporary models. This
research highlights the crucial role of dataset quality in optimizing model
efficiency for 3D point cloud classification. For more details, see the code

*Yamei Chen,Haoquan Zhang,Yangyi Huang,Zeju Qiu,Kaipeng Zhang,Yandong Wen,Weiyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探索了大型语言模型（LLM）生成可渲染成精确视觉内容的符号图形程序（SGP）的能力，重点关注可缩放矢量图形（SVG）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLM生成精确视觉内容的符号图形程序（SGP）的能力探索不足。通过生成SVG图像，研究LLM如何理解视觉世界。

Method: 提出了一个基于强化学习（RL）与可验证奖励的方法，该方法使用格式有效性门控确保可渲染的SVG，并通过交叉模态奖励（例如，SigLIP和DINO）对齐文本和渲染图像。

Result: 该方法显著提高了Qwen-2.5-7B生成SVG的质量和语义，使其性能与前沿系统相当。强化学习能够促使模型将对象分解为可控的图元，并改善场景的连贯性。

Conclusion: 符号图形编程为跨模态基础提供了精确和可解释的视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COGITAO是一个模块化和可扩展的数据生成框架和基准，旨在系统地研究视觉领域中的组合性和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前机器学习模型在组合学习概念并将其应用于新环境的能力上存在局限性。

Method: COGITAO构建基于规则的任务，这些任务将一组转换应用于网格状环境中的对象。它支持在28个可互操作的转换上进行组合，并可以调整深度，还可以广泛控制网格参数化和对象属性。

Result: 使用最先进的视觉模型进行的基线实验表明，尽管具有强大的领域内性能，但模型始终无法推广到熟悉元素的新组合。

Conclusion: COGITAO是完全开源的，包括所有代码和数据集，以支持该领域的持续研究。

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is
key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in
state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce
COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual
domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs
rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to
support continued research in this field.

TL;DR: WinT3R: a fast and accurate online reconstruction model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods have a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time performance.

Method: A sliding window mechanism for information exchange and a compact camera representation with a global camera token pool.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in online reconstruction quality, camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed.

Conclusion: WinT3R achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving both quality and speed.

Abstract: We present WinT3R, a feed-forward reconstruction model capable of online
prediction of precise camera poses and high-quality point maps. Previous
methods suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time
performance. To address this, we first introduce a sliding window mechanism
that ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window,
thereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large
computation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and
maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera
pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,
camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive
experiments on diverse datasets. Code and model are publicly available at

*Somtochukwu Azie,Yiping Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在建筑项目管理（CPM）中道德决策的可靠性，发现LLM在处理复杂情况时存在不足，建议作为决策辅助工具而非自主伦理代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估大型语言模型（LLM）在建筑项目管理（CPM）这种高风险环境中进行道德决策的伦理可行性和可靠性。

Method: 采用混合方法研究设计，定量测试两个领先的LLM在12个真实世界伦理场景中的表现，并对12位行业专家进行半结构化访谈以捕捉专业认知。

Result: 研究发现，LLM在法律合规等结构化领域表现尚可，但在处理上下文细微差别、确保问责制和提供透明推理方面存在明显缺陷。

Conclusion: 利益相关者对自主使用AI进行伦理判断表示担忧，强调需要强大的人工监督。LLM目前最适合作为决策支持辅助工具，而不是自主的伦理代理。

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

*Wenxiao Wang,Priyatham Kattakinda,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro是一个优化LLM代理的框架，可以同时搜索图和配置，以最大限度地提高代理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器在保持图固定的情况下调整配置，无法解决结构性故障模式。

Method: Maestro利用来自traces的反射文本反馈来确定编辑的优先级，提高样本效率并针对特定的故障模式。

Result: 在IFBench和HotpotQA基准测试中，Maestro始终优于其他优化器。

Conclusion: 联合图和配置搜索解决了单独的提示调整无法修复的结构性故障模式。

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型可以将模拟输出和模型设计转换为文本，但当前的方法通常依赖于一刀切的摘要，无法反映临床医生、政策制定者、患者、护理人员和健康倡导者等不同利益相关者的各种信息需求和风格偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于模型的复杂性，利益相关者可能无法充分利用它们，我们缺乏对这些利益相关者对解释的需求以及如何相应地调整它们的系统理解。

Method: 我们提出了一个逐步框架，以识别利益相关者的需求并指导大型语言模型生成针对健康模拟的定制解释。我们的程序使用混合方法设计，首先引出不同健康利益相关者的解释需求和风格偏好，然后优化大型语言模型生成定制输出的能力（例如，通过可控属性调整），然后通过一系列综合指标进行评估，以进一步改进摘要的定制生成。

Result: 未提供结果

Conclusion: 未提供结论

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的AI基准测试无法捕捉AI模型的细微能力，尤其是在物理世界建模方面。因此，需要一种更贴合人类认知的方式来评估AI。

Method: 通过对感知测试和OpenEQA基准测试进行深入访谈和大规模调查，确定了AI和人类推理的关键认知技能，如优先级排序、记忆、辨别和情境化。

Result: 研究发现，参与者认为AI缺乏解释和共情能力，但对AI的性能抱有很高的期望。将这些发现整合到基准设计中，可以为开发更符合人类标准的评估方法提供框架。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了以用户为中心的评估在AI开发中的重要性，并为研究人员和从业者提供了实用指南，旨在使AI能力与人类认知过程保持一致。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

### [131] [Language-Driven Hierarchical Task Structures as Explicit World Models for Multi-Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731)
*Brennen Hill*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出，为了发展有能力的多智能体，关键在于创造具有显式、分层世界模型的环境，这可以通过分层支架实现，其中复杂目标被分解为结构化的、可管理的子目标。利用大型语言模型动态生成这种分层支架，有效地利用语言来动态构建世界模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，复杂、显式的世界模型的开发仍然是一个关键瓶颈，特别是在复杂、长期的多智能体任务中。在机器人足球等领域，通过标准强化学习训练的智能体通常会失败，因为探索空间难以处理且奖励稀疏。

Method: 通过对 2024 年多智能体足球研究的系统回顾，确定了将符号和分层方法与多智能体强化学习 (MARL) 相结合的明确趋势。然后，提出了一种范式转变：利用大型语言模型来动态生成这种分层支架。

Result: 语言驱动的世界模型提供了一个内在的课程、密集且有意义的学习信号以及一个组合学习框架，使 Agent 模型能够以更高的样本效率获得复杂的战略行为。

Conclusion: 通过构建具有显式、语言可配置任务层的环境，弥合了低级反应行为和高级战略团队合作之间的差距，从而为训练下一代智能代理创建了一个强大且通用的框架。

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

*Yuan Sui,Yanming Zhang,Yi Liao,Yu Gu,Guohua Tang,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的范式WiA-LLM，它赋予大型语言模型（LLM）主动思考能力，通过整合What-If分析（WIA）和强化学习，使LLM能够动态模拟潜在行动的结果，从而预测未来状态，而不仅仅是对当前条件做出反应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）擅长被动地处理信息，但缺乏系统性地探索假设性未来的能力，这限制了它们在战略规划、风险评估和实时决策等动态、高风险场景中的应用。

Method: 该论文通过整合What-If分析（WIA）和强化学习，提出了WiA-LLM，一种新的范式，它赋予LLM主动思考能力。WiA-LLM通过改变输入变量来评估假设情景，并利用环境反馈来动态模拟每个潜在行动的结果。

Result: 在王者荣耀（HoK）游戏中进行的实验结果表明，WiA-LLM在预测游戏状态变化方面达到了74.2%的准确率（比基线提高了两倍）。

Conclusion: WiA-LLM代表了LLM中主动推理的一个根本性进步，它为动态环境中的鲁棒决策提供了一个可扩展的框架，对战略应用具有广泛的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 TalkToAgent 的多智能体 LLM 框架，用于为 RL 策略提供交互式、自然语言的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 XRL 方法在复杂 RL 策略和领域专家之间存在差距，因为 XRL 结果的可理解性有限，并且当前 XRL 方法的覆盖范围是孤立的，导致用户不确定使用哪种工具。

Method: 构建了一个包含五个专用 LLM 智能体（协调员、解释员、编码员、评估员和调试员）的架构，使 TalkToAgent 能够自动将用户查询映射到相关的 XRL 工具，并根据关键状态变量、预期结果或反事实解释来阐明智能体的行为。

Result: TalkToAgent 能够成功地将用户查询映射到 XRL 任务，并且编码员-调试员交互最大限度地减少了反事实生成的失败。TalkToAgent 能够有效地解释智能体的行为，并在问题域中将它们的含义上下文化。

Conclusion: TalkToAgent 成功地为强化学习策略提供了交互式的、自然语言的解释，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

Motivation: 先前的研究忽略了长期的互动、人机协作以及行为模式随时间演变。

Method: 将基于模型的智能体与一组 240 个经典的策略进行对抗，采用 Axelrod 风格的比赛。

Conclusion: 这些结果首次系统地描述了语言模型智能体中的长期合作行为，为未来研究它们在更复杂的混合人机社会环境中的作用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

### [136] [OSC: Cognitive Orchestration through Dynamic Knowledge Alignment in Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04876)
*Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Kaitong Cai,Xiaofei Sun,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个知识感知的自适应协作框架OSC，以增强多智能体系统中大型语言模型的认知协同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作在智能体选择和结果聚合方面有所进展，但专家智能体之间进行深度协作的有效语言交互仍然是一个关键瓶颈。

Method: 引入了合作者知识模型（CKM），使每个智能体能够动态地感知其合作者的认知状态。通过实时认知差距分析，智能体使用学习到的策略自适应地调整通信行为，包括内容焦点、细节层次和表达风格。

Result: 在复杂推理和问题解决基准上的实验表明，OSC 显著提高了任务性能和通信效率。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅优化了多智能体协作，而且为 LLM 智能体交互行为提供了新的见解。

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

### [137] [SparkUI-Parser: Enhancing GUI Perception with Robust Grounding and Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04908)
*Hongyi Jing,Jiafu Chen,Chen Rao,Ziqiang Dang,Jiajie Teng,Tianyi Chu,Juncheng Mo,Shuo Fang,Huaizhong Lin,Rui Lv,Chenguang Ma,Lei Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SparkUI-Parser是一个新的端到端框架，旨在提高GUI感知的定位精度和细粒度解析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM在GUI感知方面取得了很大进展，但仍然存在挑战：1)基于文本自回归机制的离散坐标建模导致定位精度较低和推理速度较慢。2)只能定位预定义的元素集合，无法解析整个界面，限制了下游任务的广泛应用和支持。

Method: 提出SparkUI-Parser，一种新的端到端框架，通过预训练的多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)与额外的token路由器和坐标解码器，实现坐标的连续建模，并引入基于改进的匈牙利匹配算法的拒绝机制。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-v2、CAGUI-Grounding和ScreenParse基准测试中，该方法始终优于SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地缓解了MLLM离散输出特性和token-by-token生成过程中的固有局限性，从而提高了精度和推理速度，同时减少了假阳性。

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于本体的方法，用于控制大型语言模型（LLM）在对话中作为对话代理时的可控性，以确保可预测和用户个性化的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为对话代理使用时，其可控性是一个关键挑战，尤其是在确保可预测和用户个性化的响应方面。

Method: 利用一组语言描述符，为定性定义的概念推导出定量定义，使其能够整合到本体中进行推理和一致性检查。然后将这些定义形式化为描述逻辑，并整合到本体中，通过微调来指导LLM的受控文本生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法提供了一致且可解释的熟练程度定义，提高了对话人工智能的透明度。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于本体的方法，可以有效提高大型语言模型在对话中的可控性和透明度。

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DOVIS的五层操作协议，用于收集代理使用情况和性能的最小、保护隐私的聚合数据，并在此基础上实现AgentRank-UC算法，该算法将使用频率和能力结合成一个统一的排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏一个全局、透明的代理交互网络，使用信号分散且私密，使得在没有协调的情况下进行排名变得不可行。

Method: 提出了DOVIS协议，包含发现、编排、验证、激励和语义五个层次。实现了AgentRank-UC算法，该算法结合了使用频率和能力。

Result: 通过仿真结果和理论保证，证明了协调协议和性能感知排名在实现可扩展、可信赖的代理网络中的可行性。

Conclusion: DOVIS协议和AgentRank-UC算法能够有效地对AI代理进行排名，并促进Web of Agents的实现。

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

TL;DR: Sticker-TTS通过协调三个协作的LRM，迭代地探索和改进解决方案，从而在推理时提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要依赖于冗余采样，忽略了历史经验的利用，限制了计算效率。

Method: 提出了一种新的测试时扩展框架Sticker-TTS，该框架协调三个协作的LRM，以迭代地探索和改进由历史尝试指导的解决方案。该框架的核心是提取的关键条件（称为贴纸），这些贴纸驱动跨多个推理回合的关键信息的提取、改进和重用。引入了一种结合模仿学习和自我改进的两阶段优化策略，以进一步提高框架的效率和性能，从而实现渐进式改进。

Result: 在包括AIME-24、AIME-25和OlymMATH在内的三个具有挑战性的数学推理基准上的大量评估表明，在相当的推理预算下，Sticker-TTS始终超越了强大的基线，包括自我一致性和先进的强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 这些结果突出了贴纸引导的历史经验利用的有效性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为ProToM的AI系统，旨在通过提供有针对性的、上下文相关的反馈来促进多智能体系统中的亲社会行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在追求独立目标时，识别何时以及如何帮助和与他人协作是一个挑战，这会阻碍合作。为了解决这个问题，本文旨在开发一种AI系统，该系统提供有用的反馈以促进亲社会行为。

Method: ProToM首先使用贝叶斯逆向规划推断智能体的目标，然后通过最大化预期效用来选择要传达的反馈，并以推断的目标分布为条件。

Result: 在Doors, Keys, and Gems以及Overcooked这两个多智能体环境中，ProToM优于基线方法，实现了更高的成功率和更短的任务完成时间，并且始终受到人类用户的青睐。

Conclusion: 最先进的大型语言和推理模型在传达上下文相关且及时的反馈方面存在不足，而ProToM可以提供有针对性的和有用的反馈。

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

Motivation: 为了缩小sim-to-real的差距，并更方便地收集关于真实世界的信息，研究重点日益集中在开发模拟复杂现实世界场景的3D世界模型上。传统的建模方式已经无法满足需求，所以需要利用先进的机器学习算法进行3D世界生成。

Method: LatticeWorld利用轻量级LLM (LLaMA-2-7B) 结合行业级渲染引擎 (Unreal Engine 5)生成动态环境。该框架接受文本描述和视觉指令作为多模态输入。

Result: LatticeWorld在场景布局生成和视觉保真度方面实现了卓越的准确性。与传统的人工生产方法相比，LatticeWorld在保持高创造质量的同时，工业生产效率提高了90倍以上。

Conclusion: LatticeWorld是一个简单而有效的3D世界生成框架，它简化了3D环境的工业生产流程。

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为 TreeIndex 的新型索引方法，用于计算图中的电阻距离，特别是在小树宽图（如道路网络）上。该方法通过结合树分解技术，实现了高效的精确单对和单源查询，并在大规模图上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于随机游走的电阻距离计算方法只能得到近似解，并且在小树宽图上的效率较低。而最短路径距离计算在这种图上效率很高。因此，作者希望利用树分解和切割属性来提高电阻距离计算的效率。

Method: 该论文首先分析了电阻距离的切割属性，并将其与树分解相结合，发现电阻距离只依赖于从节点到分解树根路径上的标签。基于此，作者提出了 TreeIndex，它构建了一个大小为 O(n * h_G) 的电阻距离标签，构建时间为 O(n * h_G^2 * d_max)。

Result: 实验结果表明，TreeIndex 在性能上显著优于现有方法。例如，在美国完整道路网络上，它在 7 小时内（单线程）构建了一个 405GB 的标签，并能在 10^-3 秒内回答精确的单对查询，在 190 秒内回答单源查询。

Conclusion: TreeIndex 是一种可扩展到大型图的精确电阻距离计算方法，特别适用于小树宽图。

Abstract: Resistance distance computation is a fundamental problem in graph analysis,
yet existing random walk-based methods are limited to approximate solutions and
suffer from poor efficiency on small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). In
contrast, shortest-path distance computation achieves remarkable efficiency on
such graphs by leveraging cut properties and tree decompositions. Motivated by
this disparity, we first analyze the cut property of resistance distance. While
a direct generalization proves impractical due to costly matrix operations, we
overcome this limitation by integrating tree decompositions, revealing that the
resistance distance $r(s,t)$ depends only on labels along the paths from $s$
and $t$ to the root of the decomposition. This insight enables compact
labelling structures. Based on this, we propose \treeindex, a novel index
method that constructs a resistance distance labelling of size $O(n \cdot
h_{\mathcal{G}})$ in $O(n \cdot h_{\mathcal{G}}^2 \cdot d_{\max})$ time, where
$h_{\mathcal{G}}$ (tree height) and $d_{\max}$ (maximum degree) behave as small
constants in many real-world small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). Our
labelling supports exact single-pair queries in $O(h_{\mathcal{G}})$ time and
single-source queries in $O(n \cdot h_{\mathcal{G}})$ time. Extensive
experiments show that TreeIndex substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches. For instance, on the full USA road network, it constructs a $405$
GB labelling in $7$ hours (single-threaded) and answers exact single-pair
queries in $10^{-3}$ seconds and single-source queries in $190$ seconds--the
first exact method scalable to such large graphs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）服务的需求不断增长，给供应商带来了巨大的部署和计算成本。LLM 路由通过根据模型和查询特征将查询定向到最佳 LLM，提供了一种经济高效的解决方案。

Method: 该算法利用近似最近邻搜索来有效估计查询特征，并对一小组初始查询执行一次性优化，以学习指导未来路由的路由策略。

Result: 该算法在 3 个基准数据集和 8 个基线测试中，整体性能平均提高 3.55 倍，成本效率提高 1.85 倍，吞吐量提高近 4.25 倍。

Conclusion: 该算法在理论上和实验上都表现出优异的性能，为在线 LLM 路由提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) services imposes
substantial deployment and computation costs on providers. LLM routing offers a
cost-efficient solution by directing queries to the optimal LLM based on model
and query features. However, existing works primarily focus on offline
scenarios and struggle to adapt to online settings with high query volume and
constrained token budgets. In this work, we introduce the first training-free
algorithm for online routing scenarios. Our algorithm leverages approximate
nearest neighbor search to efficiently estimate query features and performs a
one-time optimization over a small set of initial queries to learn a routing
strategy that guides future routing. We provide theoretical guarantees
demonstrating that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $1 - o(1)$
under natural assumptions, which is further validated by extensive experiments
across 3 benchmark datasets and 8 baselines, showing an average improvement of
3.55$\times$ in overall performance, 1.85$\times$ in cost efficiency, and
nearly 4.25$\times$ in throughput.

Conclusion: 该统一建模策略在实际推荐任务中具有有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of jointly modeling user intent diversity
and behavioral uncertainty in recommender systems. A unified representation
learning framework is proposed. The framework builds a multi-intent
representation module and an uncertainty modeling mechanism. It extracts
multi-granularity interest structures from user behavior sequences. Behavioral
ambiguity and preference fluctuation are captured using Bayesian distribution
modeling. In the multi-intent modeling part, the model introduces multiple
latent intent vectors. These vectors are weighted and fused using an attention
mechanism to generate semantically rich representations of long-term user
preferences. In the uncertainty modeling part, the model learns the mean and
covariance of behavior representations through Gaussian distributions. This
reflects the user's confidence in different behavioral contexts. Next, a
learnable fusion strategy is used to combine long-term intent and short-term
behavior signals. This produces the final user representation, improving both
recommendation accuracy and robustness. The method is evaluated on standard
public datasets. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing
representative models across multiple metrics. It also demonstrates greater
stability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance
scenarios. The approach alleviates modeling bottlenecks faced by traditional
methods when dealing with complex user behavior. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and practical value of the unified modeling strategy in
real-world recommendation tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of user bases on short video platforms, personalized
recommendation systems are playing an increasingly critical role in enhancing
user experience and optimizing content distribution. Traditional interest
modeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text

proposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest
modeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual
descriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using
cross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user
interest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature
embedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences
to model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and
accuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive
evaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing
our approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling
techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction
accuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation
click-through rates. Moreover, we incorporate interpretability mechanisms using
attention weights and feature visualization to reveal the model's decision
basis under multimodal inputs and trace interest shifts, thereby enhancing the
transparency and controllability of the recommendation system.

*Huifeng Lin,Gang Su,Jintao Liang,You Wu,Rui Zhao,Ziyue Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于大型语言模型(llm)的检索增强生成(RAG)在理解和查询行业闭源文档方面的应用，并提出了两种策略来提高证据覆盖率和答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RAG在处理法律和监管领域复杂的问答任务时，尤其是在处理大量政府文件时，效果不佳。top-$k$策略经常遗漏关键信息，导致答案不完整或不准确。

Method: 本文提出了两种策略：一是基于令牌预算自适应选择块的ONE-SHOT检索方法，二是在推理Agentic RAG框架上构建的迭代检索策略，该策略通过推理LLM动态发布搜索查询，评估检索结果，并逐步细化多轮上下文。

Result: 通过在政府文档数据集上进行的大量实验，旨在为法律和监管领域的实际应用提供实践见解和指导。

Conclusion: 本文旨在解决传统RAG在处理法律和监管领域复杂问答任务时遇到的检索瓶颈问题，并通过提出的两种策略来提高证据覆盖率和答案质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a powerful solution to understand and query the industry's closed-source
documents. However, basic RAG often struggles with complex QA tasks in legal
and regulatory domains, particularly when dealing with numerous government
documents. The top-$k$ strategy frequently misses golden chunks, leading to
incomplete or inaccurate answers. To address these retrieval bottlenecks, we
explore two strategies to improve evidence coverage and answer quality. The
first is a One-SHOT retrieval method that adaptively selects chunks based on a
token budget, allowing as much relevant content as possible to be included
within the model's context window. Additionally, we design modules to further
filter and refine the chunks. The second is an iterative retrieval strategy
built on a Reasoning Agentic RAG framework, where a reasoning LLM dynamically
issues search queries, evaluates retrieved results, and progressively refines
the context over multiple turns. We identify query drift and retrieval laziness
issues and further design two modules to tackle them. Through extensive
experiments on a dataset of government documents, we aim to offer practical
insights and guidance for real-world applications in legal and regulatory
domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于混合矩阵分解的图对比学习方法(HMFGCL)，该方法集成了两种不同的矩阵分解技术(低秩矩阵分解(MF)和奇异值分解(SVD))，以互补地获取全局协作信息，从而构建增强的视图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图对比学习方法主要基于两种数据增强策略：扰动图结构和应用聚类技术。这两种策略获取的交互信息不能完全捕获用户-项目交互。

Method: 提出一种新的方法HMFGCL，它集成了低秩矩阵分解(MF)和奇异值分解(SVD)两种不同的矩阵分解技术，以互补地获取全局协作信息，从而构建增强的视图。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，该模型优于现有的基线，尤其是在小规模数据集上。

Conclusion: HMFGCL模型在推荐系统领域表现出色，尤其是在处理数据稀疏性问题和提升小规模数据集性能方面。

Abstract: In recent years, methods that combine contrastive learning with graph neural
networks have emerged to address the challenges of recommendation systems,
demonstrating powerful performance and playing a significant role in this
domain. Contrastive learning primarily tackles the issue of data sparsity by
employing data augmentation strategies, effectively alleviating this problem
and showing promising results. Although existing research has achieved
favorable outcomes, most current graph contrastive learning methods are based
on two types of data augmentation strategies: the first involves perturbing the
graph structure, such as by randomly adding or removing edges; and the second
applies clustering techniques. We believe that the interactive information
obtained through these two strategies does not fully capture the user-item
interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method called HMFGCL (Hybrid
Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning), which integrates two
distinct matrix factorization techniques-low-rank matrix factorization (MF) and
singular value decomposition (SVD)-to complementarily acquire global
collaborative information, thereby constructing enhanced views. Experimental
results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms
existing baselines, particularly on small-scale datasets.

### [152] [Q-SafeML: Safety Assessment of Quantum Machine Learning via Quantum Distance Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04536)
*Oliver Dunn,Koorosh Aslansefat,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 量子机器学习（QML）在安全关键系统中兴起，但缺乏专门的安全机制。本文介绍了一种QML安全监控方法Q-SafeML。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的经典ML安全监控方法不适用于QML，因为量子计算存在根本差异。QML的安全机制尚不完善。

Method: Q-SafeML基于SafeML，采用量子中心距离度量，对QML输出的概率性质进行调整。这是一种模型依赖的后分类评估方法。

Result: 实验表明，Q-SafeML能够检测操作数据和训练数据之间的距离，从而解决QML背景下的概念漂移问题。这有助于知情的人工监督，提高系统的透明度和安全性。

Conclusion: Q-SafeML通过结合量子中心距离度量和模型依赖的评估，为QML提供了一种有效的安全监控方法。

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

Method: 论文提出了基于Sharpe比率、盈亏(PnL)和最大回撤等金融指标的损失函数，以及一种限制交易头寸换手率的换手率正则化方法。

Result: 提出的损失函数结合换手率正则化，在算法交易指标的评估中，优于传统的均方误差损失。

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

### [155] [Bootstrapping Task Spaces for Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04575)
*Minqi Jiang,Andrei Lupu,Yoram Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为探索性迭代（ExIt）的自课程强化学习方法，该方法利用自改进任务的重复结构，训练大型语言模型（LLM）在推理时执行多步自改进，同时仅训练最具信息量的单步迭代。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练智能体在推理时可靠地自我改进是强化学习的一个自然目标，但传统方法假设最大迭代深度是固定的，这既昂贵又随意。

Method: ExIt通过选择性地采样episode中遇到的最具信息量的中间、部分历史记录来进行持续迭代，从而扩展任务空间，并将这些起点视为新的自迭代任务实例来训练自改进策略。ExIt可以与显式探索机制配对，以维持更大的任务多样性。

Result: 在包括竞赛数学、多轮工具使用和机器学习工程在内的多个领域，证明了ExIt策略可以产生强大的推理时自我改进策略，并且能够在超过训练期间遇到的平均迭代深度的步骤预算内迭代以获得更高的性能。

Conclusion: ExIt是一种有效的自课程强化学习方法，可以训练LLM在推理时执行多步自改进，并且能够在各种领域中实现更高的性能。

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种实例自适应采样框架，用于构建紧凑且信息丰富的训练数据集，以监督学习反问题解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的学习方法旨在从先验分布的数据集中学习通用的逆映射，训练过程独立于特定的测试实例。当先验具有高内在维度或需要学习解的高精度时，可能需要大量的训练样本，从而导致大量的数据收集成本。

Method: 该方法基于特定的测试实例动态地分配采样工作，从而显著提高样本效率。通过迭代地细化以最新预测为条件的训练数据集，该策略根据每个测试实例周围的逆映射的几何形状来定制数据集。

Result: 在两种结构化先验下的逆散射问题中证明了该方法的有效性。结果表明，在具有更复杂的先验或更高的精度要求的设置中，自适应方法的优势更加明显。

Conclusion: 自适应采样策略具有广泛的适用性，并且可以容易地扩展到其他反问题，从而为传统的固定数据集训练方案提供了一种可扩展且实用的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖于单任务学习 (STL)，通常无法充分利用任务之间的互补性，并且需要更多的计算资源。

Method: QW-MTL 采用量子化学描述符来丰富分子表征，并引入了一种新颖的指数任务加权方案，该方案结合了数据集规模先验和可学习参数，以实现跨任务的动态损失平衡。

Conclusion: 证明了多任务分子学习的有效性和效率，该学习由量子信息特征和自适应任务加权增强。

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经科学和人工智能领域缺乏对不同模型家族的表征相似性度量判别能力的系统性比较。

Method: 使用信号检测理论的dprime、轮廓系数和ROC-AUC三种互补的可分离性度量，评估常用度量的判别能力，包括RSA、线性预测、Procrustes和软匹配。

Result: 可分离性随着度量施加更严格的对齐约束而系统性地增加。在基于映射的方法中，软匹配实现最高的可分离性，其次是Procrustes对齐和线性预测。非拟合方法（如RSA）也产生很强的跨家族可分离性。

Conclusion: 这项研究首次通过可分离性的角度系统地比较了相似性度量，阐明了它们的相对敏感性，并为大规模模型和大脑比较指导了度量选择。

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Motivation: 现有方法存在对分布假设要求高或覆盖率保守的问题，且共形预测不能直接扩展到函数值输出。

Method: 首先，通过离散化映射在有限维空间建立有限样本覆盖保证；然后，通过考虑离散化的渐近收敛性，将这些保证提升到函数空间。此外，将共形半径分解为离散化、校准和错误指定成分，并提出基于回归的校正方法以实现跨分辨率的校准迁移。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在分辨率变化下保持校准覆盖率，并在超分辨率任务中实现更好的覆盖。

Conclusion: 该文提出了一种新的神经算子不确定性量化方法，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

Motivation: 在转换式共形预测中，目标是构建一个预测集，使其以规定的置信度包含真实结果。研究置信度与预测集大小之间的基本权衡。

Method: 推导出一个严格的有限样本界限，表明任何非平凡的置信度都会导致预测集大小的指数增长，指数与样本数量线性相关，并与数据的条件熵成正比。此外，该界限还包括一个二阶项，即离散度，定义为对数条件概率分布的方差。

Result: 证明了在理想情况下，这个界限是可以实现的。还研究了转换式预测的一个特例，其中所有测试数据点共享相同的标签。表明这种情况简化为具有经验观察统计量的假设检验问题，并提供了一个渐近最优的置信度预测器，以及误差指数的分析。

Conclusion: 揭示了转换式共形预测中置信度和效率之间的基本权衡，并为预测集大小提供了理论界限。

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

Conclusion: 注意力机制与多项式回归之间存在关联，Transformer中的表示演化可以解释为恢复分类的最佳特征的轨迹。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

Motivation: 了解动物如何学习是神经科学的核心挑战，与开发动物或人类对齐的人工智能越来越相关。现有方法通常假设学习规则的特定参数形式，或仅限于简化的设置，例如bandit任务，不涉及从头开始学习新的输入-输出映射。

Method: 提出一个非参数框架，用深度神经网络（DNN）参数化策略权重的每次试验更新，并通过模拟恢复ground-truth规则来验证它。然后扩展到循环变体（RNN），通过允许更新依赖于试验历史来捕获非马尔可夫动力学。

Conclusion: 介绍了一个灵活的框架，用于从从头学习任务中的行为数据推断生物学习规则，为实验训练方案和行为数字孪生的开发提供见解。

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$，其中 \(n\) 是样本大小，\(d\) 是模型维度，\(\tilde{r}_{2k}\) 是一个仅取决于梯度的 \(2k\)-阶矩的项。然后，我们将其扩展到 \(\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1\) 的情形，其中 \(\bar{\theta}\) 是某个已知常数。

Result: 当隐私预算 \(\varepsilon\) 足够小时，即使损失函数不是 Lipschitz 的，我们也能得到一个上界 $\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$。对于下界，我们表明，对于任何 \(\theta\geq 2\)，\(\rho\)-zero 集中差分隐私的私有 minimax 速率的下界为 $\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$。

Conclusion: 本文研究了在 Tsybakov 噪声条件下，损失函数的 Lipschitz 常数可能无界的情况下，差分隐私随机凸优化的效用界和 minimax 速率下界。

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

*Yazdan Babazadeh Maghsoodlo,Madhur Anand,Chris T. Bauch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了使用深度学习来检测复杂系统中预示临界转变的“闪烁”现象，这种现象表明系统恢复力降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于“闪烁”现象预示着高影响但难以预测的临界转变，尤其是在气候、生态和金融等系统中。

Method: 研究方法是训练卷积长短期记忆（CNN LSTM）模型，使用由带噪声的简单多项式函数生成的合成时间序列。

Result: 研究结果表明，该模型能够准确识别“闪烁”模式，并且可以推广到不同的随机系统，可靠地检测经验数据集中的“闪烁”，例如睡鼠体温记录和非洲湿润期的古气候指标。

Conclusion: 研究结论是深度学习可以从嘈杂的非线性时间序列中提取早期预警信号，为识别各种动态系统中的不稳定性提供了一个灵活的框架。

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

### [166] [KRAFT: A Knowledge Graph-Based Framework for Automated Map Conflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04684)
*Farnoosh Hashemi,Laks V. S. Lakshmanan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KRAFT: a learning-based map conflation approach using knowledge graphs to address limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing map conflation methods are limited to linear objects and rely on pre-defined rules, hindering comprehensive and data-driven map updates.

Method: KRAFT uses knowledge graph construction, map matching with knowledge graph alignment and geospatial feature encoding, and map merging with mixed integer linear programming.

Result: KRAFT outperforms state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation tasks, with individual modules also showing superior performance.

Conclusion: KRAFT effectively merges geospatial databases without inconsistencies, advancing map conflation through a learning-based approach.

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对比姿态-肌电预训练 (CPEP) 框架，用于对齐 EMG 和姿态表示，从而学习产生高质量和姿态信息的 EMG 编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用低功耗、低成本的生物信号（例如表面肌电图 (sEMG)）可以在可穿戴设备上进行连续手势预测。

Method: 提出了一种对比姿态-肌电预训练 (CPEP) 框架，用于对齐 EMG 和姿态表示。

Result: 该模型在同分布手势分类上的性能比 emg2pose 基准模型高出 21%，在未见过的（out-of-distribution）手势分类上的性能高出 72%。

Conclusion: 从与结构化高质量数据对齐的弱模态数据中学习表征可以提高表征质量，并实现零样本分类。

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

*Gongyue Zhang,Honghai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了自然谱融合（NSF），通过将训练重新定义为可控的频谱覆盖和信息融合来改进一阶优化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一阶优化器存在固有的频率偏好，会显著影响优化路径。

Method: NSF通过p指数扩展二阶矩项，并采用循环调度来实现频率的重新加权。

Result: 实验表明，自适应方法强调低频，SGD接近中性，负指数放大高频。循环调度扩大频谱覆盖，改善跨频带融合，并诱导早期决策边界对齐。

Conclusion: NSF揭示了优化器作为主动频谱控制器的角色，并为一阶优化提供了一个统一、可控和高效的框架。

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

*Yuzhu Chen,Yingjie Wang,Shunyu Liu,Yongcheng Jing,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的名为CoVeR的无模型解码策略，它在共形预测框架内同时保持紧凑的搜索空间，并确保对期望轨迹的高覆盖概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流解码策略（如束搜索）虽然可以生成合理的候选集，但通常缺乏可证明的覆盖保证，并且难以有效地平衡搜索效率与对通用轨迹的需求，特别是那些涉及长尾序列的轨迹，这在某些实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种新的无模型解码策略CoVeR，它在共形预测框架内。

Result: 建立了PAC风格的泛化界限，保证了对于任何目标水平α∈(0,1)，CoVeR渐近地达到至少1-α的覆盖率。

Conclusion: CoVeR是一种有效的解码策略，可以在保持搜索效率的同时，保证覆盖率。

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

*Jasmine Shone,Shaden Alshammari,Mark Hamilton,Zhening Li,William Freeman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了 Beyond I-Con 框架，通过探索不同的统计散度和相似性核函数来发现新的损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KL 散度可能与真实目标不一致，并且其非对称性和无界性可能带来优化挑战。

Method: 系统地探索替代的统计散度和相似性核函数，以发现新的损失函数。

Result: 在无监督聚类、监督对比学习和降维等任务上，通过使用 TV 距离或其他有界 f-散度，并结合适当的相似性核函数，均取得了state-of-the-art或更优的结果。

Conclusion: 在表征学习优化中，考虑散度和相似性核函数的选择至关重要。

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer模型忽略了由VARMA等经典统计模型有效捕捉的细粒度局部时间依赖性。

Method: 提出了VARMA启发的特征提取器（VFE）和VARMA增强的注意力机制（VE-atten）。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上，VARMAformer始终优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将经典统计见解整合到现代深度学习框架中，对于时间序列预测具有显著的益处。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Motivation: 现有的GNN节点遗忘方法存在效率低、效果差或破坏图拓扑结构的问题，无法在性能和复杂度之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出了三种节点遗忘方法：基于类的标签替换、拓扑引导的邻居均值后验概率以及类一致的邻居节点过滤，其中后两种方法有效利用了图的拓扑特征。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够高效地移除敏感训练节点，保护GNN模型中敏感节点隐私信息，并为节点遗忘领域提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习 (RL) 模型在静态环境中学习最优策略时效率很高，但容易丢失先前学习的知识（即灾难性遗忘），导致 CRL 场景中的性能较差。

Method: 该模型集成了两个关键思想：(1) 显式训练一组具有不同价值函数的 RL 智能体（即 DQN 变体）；(2) 仲裁控制，优先考虑在最近试验中具有更高可靠性（即误差较小）的智能体。所提出的框架为 ACED-DQN。

Result: 在静态和持续环境中都表现出显着的性能改进，实证证据表明在训练期间对多样化的 DQN 进行仲裁控制的有效性。

Conclusion: 介绍了一种受人脑启发的框架，使 RL 智能体能够持续学习。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

### [178] [Detecting Blinks in Healthy and Parkinson's EEG: A Deep Learning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04951)
*Artem Lensky,Yiding Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用深度学习模型从脑电信号中准确检测眨眼的方法，用于监测认知负荷、注意力和潜在的神经系统疾病。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的眨眼通常被视为伪影，但最近的研究表明眨眼率及其变异性是监测认知负荷、注意力和潜在神经系统疾病的重要生理指标。因此，需要准确检测眨眼。

Method: 该研究将眨眼检测问题建模为序列到序列的任务，并测试了各种深度学习架构，包括循环神经网络、卷积神经网络、时间卷积网络、基于Transformer的模型和混合架构。模型在原始脑电信号上进行训练，预处理最少。

Result: CNN-RNN混合模型始终优于其他模型，在健康队列中使用1、3和5个通道时，眨眼检测准确率分别达到93.8%、95.4%和95.8%，在帕金森病患者中分别达到73.8%、75.4%和75.8%。

Conclusion: 该论文比较了用于分割脑电图记录到非自愿眨眼和非眨眼的神经网络，从而可以计算眨眼率和其他统计数据。

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的混淆矩阵归一化方法，可以更好地区分分类错误中的类相似性和分布偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混淆矩阵的值受到类相似性和分布偏差的双重影响，难以区分各自的贡献。

Method: 使用迭代比例拟合引入双随机归一化，这是行和列归一化的一种推广。

Result: 该方法恢复了类相似性的潜在结构，能够更准确地诊断模型行为并支持更有针对性的改进。

Conclusion: 混淆矩阵归一化与模型的内部类表示之间存在对应关系，从几何角度提供了对分类器更深入的理解。

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

TL;DR: 提出了 NeuSA，一种受经典谱方法启发的 PINN，用于求解具有可变系数的线性和非线性 PDE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的基于 MLP 的 PINN 在处理复杂的初值问题时通常无法收敛，导致违反因果关系并遭受偏向低频分量的谱偏差。

Method: NeuSA 学习将底层 PDE 投影到谱基上，从而得到动力学的有限维表示，然后与改编的神经 ODE (NODE) 集成。

Result: 在线性和非线性波动方程的规范基准上验证了 NeuSA，与其他架构相比，表现出强大的性能，具有更快的收敛速度、改进的时间一致性和卓越的预测精度。

Conclusion: NeuSA 克服了谱偏差，通过利用谱表示实现的高频分量；通过继承 NODE 的因果结构来加强因果关系；并通过基于经典方法的初始化方案在目标解附近开始训练。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Motivation: 旨在解决动态拓扑下决策不稳定和结构感知不足的挑战。

Method: 通过集成结构感知状态编码（SASE）模块和策略自适应图更新（PAGU）机制，构建了一个统一的状态表示和结构演化框架。

Result: 在真实GEANT拓扑数据集上进行的实验表明，该方法在吞吐量、延迟控制和链路平衡方面优于现有的图强化学习模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态和复杂的云网络中实现了高效和稳健的路由。

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

Motivation: 现有的测试时自适应（TTA）方法在实际应用中由于测试数据具有混合分布偏移、小批量大小、在线不平衡标签分布偏移等问题而表现不稳定，甚至会损害模型性能。

Method: 论文首先分析了TTA不稳定的原因，发现批归一化层是关键因素。然后，提出了SAR方法，通过移除噪声样本和鼓励模型权重达到平坦最小值来稳定TTA。最后，提出了SAR^2，通过冗余正则化器和不平等正则化器来防止表征崩溃。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在上述测试场景下比现有方法更稳定，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的测试时自适应方法，能够在复杂的测试场景下提高模型的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

Motivation: 传统的定向进化方法需要昂贵且耗时的生化筛选，而机器学习方法可以通过选择信息量大的变体来提高筛选质量并减少筛选数量。

Method: 该方法结合了贝叶斯优化和从预训练蛋白质语言模型中提取的蛋白质变体的信息表示。

Result: 基于序列嵌入的新表示显著提高了贝叶斯优化的性能，在相同的筛选次数下产生了更好的结果。同时，该方法优于最先进的具有回归目标的机器学习辅助定向进化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种有效的机器学习辅助蛋白质定向进化方法。

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising
variants for screening to increase their quality and reduce the amount of
necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的初始化方案，该方案优于现有的初始化方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去几年，已经提出了各种初始化方案。其中一些方法强调保持激活的单位方差和通过网络层的梯度传播。一些方法独立于深度信息，而另一些方法则考虑了总网络深度以获得更好的初始化。

Method: 本文进行了一项综合研究，其中结合了每一层的深度信息以及总网络，以获得更好的初始化方案。我们提出了一种以灵活的方式增加网络方差的新方法，该方法结合了每一层深度信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有的初始化方案表现更好。

Conclusion: 对于更深的网络，整个网络的单位方差的理论假设表现不佳。它需要增加从第一层激活到最后一层激活的网络方差。

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

Motivation: 在肿瘤学中，准确预测事件发生时间的结果至关重要，它对治疗计划和患者管理有重大影响。因此，我们提出了MultiSurv模型。

Method: MultiSurv利用DeepHit模型，加入了一个投影层和跨模态交叉注意力机制，以整合异构患者数据。

Result: 在前列腺癌生化复发预测任务中，MultiSurv在交叉验证集上取得了0.843的C-index，在CHIMERA开发集上取得了0.818的C-index。在膀胱癌复发预测任务中，MultiSurv在交叉验证集上取得了0.662的C-index，在开发集上取得了0.457的C-index。

Conclusion: 多模态整合与深度生存学习相结合，为前列腺癌和膀胱癌的个体化风险分层提供了一条有希望的途径。该框架具有广泛的适用性，可用于涉及异构生物医学数据的生存预测任务。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的NCO方法效率较低，因为它们在每一步之间状态变化很小，没有充分利用先前步骤的计算结果。

Method: 训练一个循环编码器，该编码器基于状态和前一步的嵌入来计算状态嵌入。

Result: 循环编码器可以用更少的层实现与非循环编码器相当或更好的性能，从而显著提高延迟。

Conclusion: 循环编码器在TSP、CVRP和OP等问题上表现良好，并可集成到大型邻域搜索算法中，具有实际意义。

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to
showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

TL;DR: HyPINO: Multi-physics neural operator for zero-shot generalization across parametric PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve zero-shot generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Combines a Swin Transformer-based hypernetwork with mixed supervision: labeled data from analytical solutions (MMS) and unlabeled samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. Iterative refinement procedure compares the physics of the generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a delta PINN.

Result: Achieves strong zero-shot accuracy on seven benchmark problems, outperforming other methods. Iterative refinement reduces error. Fine-tuning PINNs initialized by HyPINO converges faster and to lower final error.

Conclusion: HyPINO is a scalable approach for solving complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

Method: 该研究使用了真实和合成数据集来验证这一观察结果，并分析了数据几何结构与标签层次结构之间的关系。

Result: 研究表明，使用细粒度标签训练并不总能提高分类精度。其有效性取决于数据的几何结构以及数据集大小和模型容量等因素。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，细粒度标签训练的有效性取决于数据几何结构、数据集大小和模型容量等关键因素。

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

Result: 证明了对于加性自适应对抗者，可学习性是一个比对于加性无知对抗者更强的条件。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在自适应对抗环境下，分布类的可学习性面临更严格的挑战。

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理中，KV缓存大小随上下文长度和模型深度线性增长，成为主要瓶颈。现有的KV缓存压缩方法存在强制刚性启发式、扰乱张量布局或需要专门的计算内核等问题。

Method: 该方法聚合注意力分数以估计令牌重要性，独立选择特定于头的令牌，并将它们对齐到复合令牌中，同时保持现有推理引擎所需的统一缓存结构。全局分配机制进一步调整跨层的保留预算，为具有信息令牌的层分配更多容量。

Result: 该方法在保持精度的同时实现了显著的内存减少，并且始终优于先前的结构化和半结构化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法与标准推理pipeline完全兼容，为高效的长上下文LLM部署提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

*Bastien Dubail,Stefan Stojanovic,Alexandre Proutière*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了强化学习（RL）中低秩结构假设的有效性，发现平移后的后继测度具有低秩结构，并提供了有限样本性能保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现代强化学习算法都隐含地假设低秩结构，例如，无奖励和目标条件强化学习方法通常假定后继测度允许低秩表示。本文旨在挑战这一假设。

Method: 本文首先指出后继测度本身不是低秩的。然后，证明了低秩结构自然出现在平移后的后继测度中，该测度捕获了绕过一些初始转换后的系统动态。此外，本文还推导出了一类新的马尔可夫链泛函不等式，称为 Type II Poincaré 不等式，并用它来量化有效低秩近似和估计所需的平移量。

Result: 本文的分析表明，近似和估计误差主要受相应矩阵的光谱可恢复性控制。此外，本文还建立了必要平移与基础动力系统的局部混合特性之间的联系，这提供了一种选择平移的自然方法。

Conclusion: 实验验证了理论结果，并表明平移后继测度确实可以提高目标条件强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based
approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead
remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training
framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient
cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales
and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to
3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while
cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing
units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over
the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

Abstract: This work addresses the key challenges of applying federated learning to
large-scale deep neural networks, particularly the issue of client drift due to
data heterogeneity across clients and the high costs of communication,
computation, and memory. We propose FedSub, an efficient subspace algorithm for
federated learning on heterogeneous data. Specifically, FedSub utilizes
subspace projection to guarantee local updates of each client within
low-dimensional subspaces, thereby reducing communication, computation, and
memory costs. Additionally, it incorporates low-dimensional dual variables to
mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

Motivation: 该研究旨在利用机器学习优化碳捕获操作，减少环境影响，并提高碳捕获和储存技术的效率、稳定性和可持续性。

Method: 开发了四种深度学习架构（Basic LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, Convolutional LSTM），并进行了因果影响分析，系统地扰动了八个输入变量。

Conclusion: 该研究表明机器学习不仅是一种预测工具，也是一种决策支持系统，可用于优化碳捕获操作。

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) 的方法，用于检测AGC系统中的虚假数据注入攻击 (FDIA)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的黑盒方法难以检测到隐蔽的网络攻击，且忽略了系统的非线性。

Method: 使用KAN模型离线学习AGC测量数据之间的复杂非线性关系，并提取符号公式。

Result: KAN模型和符号公式的FDIA检测率分别高达95.97%和95.9%，且误报率低。

Conclusion: 所提出的KAN模型为增强AGC网络安全提供了一种可靠的方法。

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

TL;DR: SpikingBrain, a brain-inspired model, is introduced to address the efficiency bottlenecks of Transformer-based LLMs, especially for long-context processing, using the MetaX GPU cluster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based LLMs suffer from quadratic training computation scaling and linear inference memory growth, limiting long-context processing. Training on non-NVIDIA platforms is also challenging.

Method: SpikingBrain employs linear and hybrid-linear attention architectures with adaptive spiking neurons, an efficient conversion-based training pipeline, a dedicated spike coding framework, and customized system engineering for MetaX hardware.

Result: SpikingBrain-7B and SpikingBrain-76B demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms, achieving comparable performance to Transformer baselines with improved long-sequence training efficiency and constant memory inference. SpikingBrain-7B achieves over 100x speedup in Time to First Token for 4M-token sequences.

Conclusion: Brain-inspired mechanisms have the potential to drive the next generation of efficient and scalable large model design, as demonstrated by SpikingBrain's performance and efficiency gains.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

Abstract: With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring
the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report
introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and
frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch
convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and
frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a
Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When
benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the
art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media
verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

Conclusion: 通过GNN学习自适应超参数可以有效改善分布式ADMM的性能。

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

Conclusion: DRL-PUT 框架有效地提升了广告推荐系统的性能，并通过消融研究和个性化分析验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.
