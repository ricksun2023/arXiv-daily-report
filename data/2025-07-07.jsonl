Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust\nGame (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and\nreciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to\nsystematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types\nof beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus\ntask-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;\n(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;\nand (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We\nalso explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors\nin the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research\nobjectives.

Subsequently, an\nimproved SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism is introduced to further\nenhance the model's feature extraction capability, enabling more precise\nidentification of disease characteristics. Extensive experiments, including\nablation studies and comparative evaluations, are conducted on a\nself-constructed shrimp disease dataset, with generalization tests extended to\nthe URPC2020 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a\n32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5\nof 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms\nother lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model\nsize. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the\nmodel's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The\nproposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,\nproviding reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in\nshrimp aquaculture."}

This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss\nreward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the\nexternal reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,\nenabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration\nstagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across\nsix mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization\nand excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks."}

However, in\nstandard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in\nnatural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To\ncapture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have\nexplored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent\nspace, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether\nsuch reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer\nthat reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We\nexamine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of\nprobing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens.

However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training.

We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because\nthere are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33\nvideos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with\na complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a\nplatform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in\ncomplex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple\nSOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the\nfoundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:\nhttps://github.com/loseevaya/CrowdTrack ."}

Central to this approach is\na generative mechanism that creates \\emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem\ninstances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \\emph{soft constraints}\nand unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables\nthe framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby\nfreeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely\non human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and\nseeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner\niteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,\nregularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and\nconstraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy\ncorresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at\nlower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By\ninterpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \\emph{functors} that generate\nand condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional\nstructure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively\ngeneralised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing\nmeta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and\ncompared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design\nprinciples for structuring meta-learning.

Results show that rule-based agents achieve\nnear-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability\n(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL\nagents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest\nvolatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced\napproach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while\nmaintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These\nfindings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured\nby static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing."}

An\nideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal\nbackground intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the\ncorresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a\nsemantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse\nappearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based\nmethods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly\ngenerators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when\nthe mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms\nsemantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains\nplausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary\nartifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD\ndataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly\ntasks."}

We find multiple evidences that this limitation\nrelates to training data composition: human training demonstrations\npredominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,\nunlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.\nRemarkably, simply appending \"Wait\" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting\nthat the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a\ncritical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving\ntheir reliability and trustworthiness."}

Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is\nessential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling\ninteraction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is\noften treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality\nin its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is\ncollected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and\ndomain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects\nshared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful\ndynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be\ntreated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and\ngrounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,\nlower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and\ncomputationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.\nDeveloping models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement\ndata will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and\ncontrol, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across\nbiological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a\nwindow into how intelligent systems engage with the world."}

The emergence of reasoning-capable\nmodels has further widened the cost gap between \"thinking\" (high reasoning) and\n\"non-thinking\" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that\napproximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the\nnon-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.\nThis highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that\ndynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could\noptimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,\nwe further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing\nframework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or\nnon-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets\ndemonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.\n0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by\n36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis\nindicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays\nand even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.\nFinally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index\nto comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token\ncost."}

To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss\nreward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the\nexternal reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,\nenabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration\nstagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across\nsix mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization\nand excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks."}

Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer\nmatching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it\ngenerate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the\nreference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach.
