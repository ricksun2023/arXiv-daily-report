Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models\nthat rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics\nfrom the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs)\nhave been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational\nstructures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring\nintra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based\nframework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair\nas a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained\nintra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level\nrepresentations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the\nscalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a\nsplit-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for\nefficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in both classification and regression tasks.

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u201c\u60c5\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u201d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u60c5\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fc5\u987b\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u5373\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u7b49\uff09\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u53e5\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d28\u7591\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5404\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5373\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\uff09\u6765\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u505a\u51fa\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\uff08\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u5c42\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u4ee5\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u60c5\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u3002"}}

The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the\nworld model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step.

This study presents the\nfirst comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,\nencompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer\nlearning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,\nwe conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite\nimage-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise\nclassification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of\nvaried training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,\nworkflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a\nsufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate\nand generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that\nmatches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop\nmapping.

The lab consists of two\ntasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,\nGerman, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.\nBoth corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and\nmanually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor\nmarket data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.\n  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered\nthe evaluation of gender bias.\n  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions.

Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal\nmicrovasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as\npotential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics\nframework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived\nthrough deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to\nhighlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the\nconventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate\nadjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,\nwhich is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal\nphenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum\nlipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography\nElectrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).\nStrong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly\nbetween average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as\ntriacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These\nassociations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under\nmetabolic stress.

In this work, we show\nthat the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part\ndriven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations.\nSpecifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream\nwhich systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled\nreasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction\ncannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes.

However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two\nkey limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial\nconstruction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and\n(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution\nstrategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic\nreinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms\ntree-based reasoning into an adaptive process.

However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest.

Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models.

These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are\ninsufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the\nimportance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and\nresource-efficient collaborative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GEMMAS\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u534f\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u662f\u4e0d\u591f\u7684\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u548c\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 GEMMAS\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5185\u90e8\u534f\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6355\u6349\u534f\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u4fe1\u606f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5f97\u5206 (IDS) \u6765\u8861\u91cf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u8def\u5f84\u6bd4\u7387 (UPR) \u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30 GEMMAS\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u70b9\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86 GSM8K \u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u76f8\u5dee 2.1% \u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728 IDS \u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u5dee 12.8%\uff0c\u5728 UPR \u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u5dee 80%\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u663e\u7740\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u522b\u8bca\u65ad\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6613\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u534f\u4f5c AI \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6613\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the heavy\nreliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and\nincurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of\ntask-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from\ntask-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and\ncost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this\nparadigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety\nrisks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a\nscalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $\n30\\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective\nlearning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution\nmismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics\nmodel equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder\n(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module\nto verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation\ntasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%\nimprovement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in\ndownstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using\nreplay-based video validation.

From this\nperspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to\nimprove the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes\nchain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing\nMachine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into\natomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch\nmechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in\nelementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we\nconstruct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and\n18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length\ngeneralization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various\ntasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.\nThe experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,\ninstead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length\ngeneralization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors\nconsistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.\nThis work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of\nLLM reasoning from synthetic data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTAIL\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5373\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u66f4\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u8fd0\u7b97\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7740\u91cd\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u7531\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff08TAIL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u4eff\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3shortcut learning\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u83b7\u53d6\u673a\u5236\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u57fa\u672c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "TAIL\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86Qwen2.5-7B\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cDeepSeek-R1\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u601d\u7ef4\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8eTAIL\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u5c5e\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bfb\u5199\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "TAIL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86Qwen2.5-7B\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cDeepSeek-R1\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u4e8eTAIL\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u5c5e\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bfb\u5199\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

However, domain shifts often undermine model\nreliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and\nsafety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating\ntarget domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance\nwithout ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient\nrobustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While\nprevious work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,\nthese methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper\nfirst adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image\nclassification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the\nlimitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane\nfeatures, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework\n(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image\nencoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane\ndetection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the\nOpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),\ndemonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE\nof 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727.

However,\ninterrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual\nuni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an\nuncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of\nlarge-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty\npropagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the\nrelationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and\njoint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting\nof cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be\noptimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are\ngeneralisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be\nexplained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,\nalong with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this\nlearned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these\nuncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may\nbe estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of\ncardiac disease prediction tasks.

To address the challenge of\nacquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods\nutilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the\nperformance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this\nstudy, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation\nefficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.\nWe re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the\nfirst scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first\nscribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ\nself-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the\nmodel to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.\nIn addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that\nadaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic\nregions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature\ndiscriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose\na gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to\nregulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward\nemphasizing potential tampered regions.

The absence of ground truths for\nunknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have\naddressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently\nproposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)\nis a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown\nobjects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces\nissues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.\n  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel\nmodel, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of\nObjectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate\nlayers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and\nobjectness predictions in PROB.

However, existing prompt\ntuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data\nscarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in\nthe input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on\ncomplex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,\nseverely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we\npropose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA\ntuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves\nperformance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art\nprompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains\nsusceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this\nrisk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique\neffectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a\nmore stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.\nThrough extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we\ndemonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of\nbase-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and\ncross-dataset generalization.

However, their dense and\nirregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational\ncost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing\nlocalized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based\nanomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with\ncluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.\nSpecifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal\nprototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a\nlocal level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is\ncomputed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each\ncluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided\nstrategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as\ncentroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,\nenabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons.
