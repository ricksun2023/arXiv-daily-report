### [1] [Multi-Personality Generation of LLMs at Decoding-time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01891)
*Rongxin Chen,Yunfan Li,Yige Yuan,Bingbing Xu,Huawei Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多重人格生成框架（MPG），它可以在解码时灵活地控制多重人格，而无需依赖稀缺的多维模型或额外的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法成本高、可扩展性差，或者依赖外部模型或启发式方法，限制了灵活性和鲁棒性。本文旨在解决LLM多重人格生成的问题。

Method: 利用单维模型中的隐式密度比，将任务重新 формулировать 为从聚合这些比率的目标策略中采样。设计了基于推测块级别的拒绝采样（SCR）来高效地执行MPG。

Result: 在MBTI人格和角色扮演实验中，MPG的性能提升高达16%-18%。

Conclusion: MPG框架在多重人格生成方面具有有效性。

Abstract: Multi-personality generation for LLMs, enabling simultaneous embodiment of
multiple personalization attributes, is a fundamental challenge. Existing
retraining-based approaches are costly and poorly scalable, while decoding-time
methods often rely on external models or heuristics, limiting flexibility and
robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Personality Generation
(MPG) framework under the decoding-time combination paradigm. It flexibly
controls multi-personality without relying on scarce multi-dimensional models
or extra training, leveraging implicit density ratios in single-dimensional
models as a "free lunch" to reformulate the task as sampling from a target
strategy aggregating these ratios. To implement MPG efficiently, we design
Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR), which generates
responses in chunks and parallelly validates them via estimated thresholds
within a sliding window. This significantly reduces computational overhead
while maintaining high-quality generation. Experiments on MBTI personality and
Role-Playing demonstrate the effectiveness of MPG, showing improvements up to
16%-18%. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Libra117/MPG .

### [2] [Rethinking LLM Human Simulation: When a Graph is What You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02135)
*Joseph Suh,Suhong Moon,Serina Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 图神经网络(GNN)在离散选择模拟任务中可以媲美甚至超过大型语言模型(LLM)，同时体积更小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地用于模拟人类行为，但研究人员希望知道是否可以使用更小、领域更专业的模型代替LLM。

Method: 提出了Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS)，它将离散选择模拟任务转化为图上的链接预测问题，利用关系知识，并在需要时才结合语言表征。

Result: 在三个模拟数据集上的三个关键设置中，GEMS的准确性与LLM相当或更好，同时效率、可解释性和透明度更高。

Conclusion: 基于图的模型可以作为LLM的轻量级替代方案，在人类模拟方面具有很大的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate humans, with
applications ranging from survey prediction to decision-making. However, are
LLMs strictly necessary, or can smaller, domain-grounded models suffice? We
identify a large class of simulation problems in which individuals make choices
among discrete options, where a graph neural network (GNN) can match or surpass
strong LLM baselines despite being three orders of magnitude smaller. We
introduce Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which casts discrete
choice simulation tasks as a link prediction problem on graphs, leveraging
relational knowledge while incorporating language representations only when
needed. Evaluations across three key settings on three simulation datasets show
that GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs, with far greater
efficiency, interpretability, and transparency, highlighting the promise of
graph-based modeling as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation.

### [3] [IG-Pruning: Input-Guided Block Pruning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02213)
*Kangyu Qiao,Shaolei Zhang,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的输入感知块状剪枝方法，称为 IG-Pruning，用于动态选择transformer层，以提高大型语言模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的计算需求不断增长，高效的推理对于实际部署至关重要。现有的深度剪枝方法依赖于固定的块掩码，导致在不同任务和输入上的性能欠佳。

Method: 通过语义聚类和 L0 优化发现不同的掩码候选，并实现高效的动态剪枝，无需大量训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法始终优于最先进的静态深度剪枝方法。

Conclusion: IG-Pruning 方法特别适用于资源受限的部署场景。

Abstract: With the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs),
efficient inference has become increasingly critical for practical deployment.
Depth pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing the
computational costs of large language models by removing transformer layers.
However, existing methods typically rely on fixed block masks, which can lead
to suboptimal performance across different tasks and inputs. In this paper, we
propose IG-Pruning, a novel input-aware block-wise pruning method that
dynamically selects layer masks at inference time. Our approach consists of two
stages: (1) Discovering diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and
L0 optimization, and (2) Implementing efficient dynamic pruning without the
need for extensive training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods, making
it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

*Jonathan Liu,Haoling Qiu,Jonathan Lasko,Damianos Karakos,Mahsa Yarmohammadi,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 医学聊天机器人可能在涉及非医学因素的情况下表现不一致，例如人口统计信息。该研究旨在了解医学聊天机器人在何种情况下会失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解医学聊天机器人在涉及非医学因素时，例如人口统计信息，无法提供一致建议的情况。

Method: 开发了一个基础设施，自动生成查询来探测大型语言模型（LLM），并使用多个LLM-as-a-judge设置和提示来评估这些查询的答案。提示创建流程对患者的人口统计信息、病史、疾病和写作风格进行采样，以创建逼真的问题。

Result: LLM注释者表现出较低的一致性得分（平均Cohen's Kappa κ=0.118），并且只有特定的（回答，评估）LLM对在写作风格、性别和种族方面产生统计上的显著差异。

Conclusion: 建议使用LLM评估的研究使用多个LLM作为评估者，以避免得出具有统计意义但不具有普遍性的结果，尤其是在缺乏真实数据的情况下。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are
prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical
contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors
are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to
understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as
expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries
to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple
LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples
the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to
create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our
evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using
LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge
treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies
on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation
LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's
Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs
yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and
races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as
evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but
non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We
also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code
and dataset are available here:

### [5] [LTD-Bench: Evaluating Large Language Models by Letting Them Draw](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02347)
*Liuhao Lin,Ke Li,Zihan Xu,Yuchen Shi,Yulei Qin,Yan Zhang,Xing Sun,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LTD-Bench transforms LLM evaluation from abstract scores to directly observable visual outputs by requiring models to generate drawings, exposing spatial reasoning limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation paradigms for LLMs rely on opaque numerical metrics that conceal fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning, creating a disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities.

Method: The paper introduces LTD-Bench, a benchmark that requires models to generate drawings through dot matrices or executable code. It includes generation and recognition tasks across three difficulty levels.

Result: Experiments with state-of-the-art models expose an alarming capability gap in establishing bidirectional mappings between language and spatial concepts.

Conclusion: LTD-Bench's visual outputs enable powerful diagnostic analysis, offering a potential approach to investigate model similarity and revealing limitations as genuine world models.

Abstract: Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) represent a
critical blind spot in AI research--relying on opaque numerical metrics that
conceal fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning while providing no
intuitive understanding of model capabilities. This deficiency creates a
dangerous disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities,
particularly for applications requiring physical world understanding. We
introduce LTD-Bench, a breakthrough benchmark that transforms LLM evaluation
from abstract scores to directly observable visual outputs by requiring models
to generate drawings through dot matrices or executable code. This approach
makes spatial reasoning limitations immediately apparent even to non-experts,
bridging the fundamental gap between statistical performance and intuitive
assessment. LTD-Bench implements a comprehensive methodology with complementary
generation tasks (testing spatial imagination) and recognition tasks (assessing
spatial perception) across three progressively challenging difficulty levels,
methodically evaluating both directions of the critical language-spatial
mapping. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models expose an
alarming capability gap: even LLMs achieving impressive results on traditional
benchmarks demonstrate profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional
mappings between language and spatial concept--a fundamental limitation that
undermines their potential as genuine world models. Furthermore, LTD-Bench's
visual outputs enable powerful diagnostic analysis, offering a potential
approach to investigate model similarity.

### [6] [Let Multimodal Embedders Learn When to Augment Query via Adaptive Query Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02358)
*Wongyu Kim,Hochang Lee,Sanghak Lee,Yoonsung Kim,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M-Solomon, a universal multimodal embedder, adaptively determines when to augment queries to improve performance and reduce latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Augmenting every query leads to substantial embedding latency and can be detrimental to performance for some queries, especially in multimodal environments.

Method: Divides queries into two groups (require augmentation vs. not), generates augmentations for queries that need them using a Multimodal LLM, and learns to generate '/augment' or '/embed' prefixes to control augmentation adaptively.

Result: M-Solomon surpasses baselines (both with and without augmentation) and provides faster embedding latency.

Conclusion: M-Solomon effectively and efficiently augments queries adaptively in multimodal environments.

Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further
information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have
proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation
for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by
leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly
trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,
showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial
embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for
some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal
environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal
multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our
approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at
the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other
includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that
generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging
a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.
Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary
by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for
queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.
Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline
without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that
always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个动态更新的中文语言LLM安全基准LiveSecBench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在中文法律和社会框架下，评估LLM在六个关键维度（法律、伦理、事实性、隐私、对抗鲁棒性和推理安全）的安全性。

Method: 通过动态更新计划，纳入新的威胁向量，例如计划在下次更新中纳入文本到图像生成安全和代理安全。

Result: LiveSecBench (v251030) 已经评估了 18 个 LLM，提供了中文语言环境下的 AI 安全概况。

Conclusion: LiveSecBench提供了一个评估中文语言LLM安全性的基准，并通过动态更新保持其相关性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose LiveSecBench, a dynamic and continuously updated
safety benchmark specifically for Chinese-language LLM application scenarios.
LiveSecBench evaluates models across six critical dimensions (Legality, Ethics,
Factuality, Privacy, Adversarial Robustness, and Reasoning Safety) rooted in
the Chinese legal and social frameworks. This benchmark maintains relevance
through a dynamic update schedule that incorporates new threat vectors, such as
the planned inclusion of Text-to-Image Generation Safety and Agentic Safety in
the next update. For now, LiveSecBench (v251030) has evaluated 18 LLMs,
providing a landscape of AI safety in the context of Chinese language. The
leaderboard is publicly accessible at https://livesecbench.intokentech.cn/.

### [8] [Beyond Single Embeddings: Capturing Diverse Targets with Multi-Query Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02770)
*Hung-Ting Chen,Xiang Liu,Shauli Ravfogel,Eunsol Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有的文本检索器通常生成单个查询向量来检索相关文档，但这可能无法捕捉到查询的多重含义。本文提出了一个名为AMER的新型检索器架构，它可以自回归地生成多个查询向量，从而更好地捕捉到目标文档的多种分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索器在目标文档嵌入之间的距离增大时表现不佳。这是因为查询可能存在多种解释，而单个查询向量无法捕捉到这些解释。

Method: AMER模型自回归地生成多个查询向量，并使用所有预测的查询向量从语料库中检索文档。

Result: 在合成向量化数据上，AMER的性能比单嵌入模型好4倍。在真实的多答案检索数据集上，AMER的性能也优于单嵌入基线4%和21%。

Conclusion: 多查询向量检索器具有很大的潜力，为未来的研究开辟了一个新的方向。

Abstract: Most text retrievers generate \emph{one} query vector to retrieve relevant
documents. Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the
query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the
query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers
we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings
grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture,
\emph{A}utoregressive \emph{M}ulti-\emph{E}mbedding \emph{R}etriever (AMER).
Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the
predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show
that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture
multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than
single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer
retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. AMER presents 4 and 21\% relative
gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on.
Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset
where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other. We
demonstrate the potential of using a multi-query vector retriever and open up a
new direction for future work.

### [9] [AyurParam: A State-of-the-Art Bilingual Language Model for Ayurveda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02374)
*Mohd Nauman,Sravan Gvm,Vijay Devane,Shyam Pawar,Viraj Thakur,Kundeshwar Pundalik,Piyush Sawarkar,Rohit Saluja,Maunendra Desarkar,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AyurParam-2.9B is a domain-specific, bilingual language model for Ayurveda, fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B. It outperforms other models in its size class and performs competitively against much larger models on the BhashaBench-Ayur benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream LLMs struggle with specialized domains like Ayurveda, which require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise.

Method: The authors fine-tuned Param-1-2.9B using an extensive, expertly curated Ayurveda dataset with context-aware, reasoning, and objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi. They used rigorous annotation protocols.

Result: AyurParam surpasses all open-source instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5-3B parameters) and demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger models on BhashaBench-Ayur.

Conclusion: Authentic domain adaptation and high-quality supervision are necessary for delivering reliable, culturally congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.

Abstract: Current large language models excel at broad, general-purpose tasks, but
consistently underperform when exposed to highly specialized domains that
require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise. In particular,
traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced
textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately
interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized,
bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive,
expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical
guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and
objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation
protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on
BhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source
instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also
demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger
models. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain
adaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally
congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.

### [10] [AutoAdv: Automated Adversarial Prompting for Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02376)
*Aashray Reddy,Andrew Zagula,Nicholas Saban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型容易受到对抗性提示的攻击，这些提示会引发有害的输出。以往的评估主要集中在单轮交互，而实际攻击是通过自适应的多轮对话展开的。本文提出了AutoAdv，这是一个无需训练的自动化多轮越狱框架，在六轮内对Llama-3.1-8B的攻击成功率高达95%，比单轮基线提高了24%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型在安全机制上存在漏洞，尤其是在多轮对话中，单轮交互优化后的对齐策略无法保持鲁棒性。

Method: AutoAdv结合了三种自适应机制：模式管理器（从成功的攻击中学习以增强未来的提示）、温度管理器（基于失败模式动态调整采样参数）和两阶段重写策略（伪装有害请求然后迭代地改进它们）。

Result: 在商业和开源模型（GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B）上的广泛评估表明，当前的安全机制存在持续的漏洞，多轮攻击始终优于单轮方法。

Conclusion: 单轮交互优化后的对齐策略无法在扩展对话中保持鲁棒性，因此迫切需要具备多轮意识的防御。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where
adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on
single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive
multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for
automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate
on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn
baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern
manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a
temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on
failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful
requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial
and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent
vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks
consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate
that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to
maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need
for multi-turn-aware defenses.

*Kentaro Ueda,François Portet,Hirohiko Suwa,Keiichi Yasumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探索了合并领域特定持续预训练（CPT）模型以创建金融领域大型语言模型（LLM）的方法，通过合并金融、数学和日语领域的专家模型，并采用三阶段评估框架，在包含18个任务的金融基准上评估了三种合并方法（Task Arithmetic、TIES和DARE-TIES），结果表明合并专家模型可以提高性能并产生新兴的跨领域技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在通用任务中表现出色，但在金融等专业领域中表现不佳，需要在领域知识、数学推理和多语言处理方面具备多样化的技能。合并领域特定的持续预训练（CPT）“专家”模型提供了一种实用的替代方案，以替代成本高昂且不稳定的多技能训练。

Method: 创建金融、数学和日语领域的专家金融LLM，并提出一个三阶段评估，侧重于知识恢复、互补性和涌现，并在一个全面的金融基准上评估三种合并方法（Task Arithmetic、TIES和DARE-TIES）。

Result: 结果表明，将专家模型与其基础模型合并可以恢复CPT期间丢失的通用知识，而合并专家模型可以提高性能，并且可以产生新兴的跨领域技能。在这些方法中，Task Arithmetic表现强劲，但对超参数敏感，而TIES更稳健。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了CPT模型合并的第一个基础分析，建立了一个有原则的框架，并为从现有资产构建多技能LLM提供了明确的指导。

Abstract: While LLMs excel at general tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like
finance, requiring diverse skills in domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning,
and multilingual processing. Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training
(CPT) "experts" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable
multi-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
model-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and
Japanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,
complementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task
Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated
from 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an
expert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while
merging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain
skills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is
hyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also
suggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent
skills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first
foundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework
and providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing
assets.

### [12] [Prompting for Policy: Forecasting Macroeconomic Scenarios with Synthetic LLM Personas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02458)
*Giulia Iadisernia,Carolina Camassa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于人物角色提示（persona-based prompting）是否能提高大型语言模型（LLM）在宏观经济预测任务中的表现。实验结果表明，GPT-4o的预测精度与人类专家相当，但人物角色描述并没有带来明显的预测优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在宏观经济预测中的能力，并探索人物角色提示的影响。

Method: 使用PersonaHub语料库中的经济学相关人物角色，提示GPT-4o复现欧洲央行专业预测调查，并与人类专家组的预测结果进行比较。同时，通过消融实验评估人物角色描述的影响。

Result: GPT-4o的预测精度与人类专家相当，但在样本外数据上仍能保持竞争力。人物角色描述并没有带来明显的预测优势。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在提供相关背景数据的情况下，即使在样本外宏观经济事件中也能实现有竞争力的预测精度，但与人类专家组相比，不同的提示产生的结果非常相似。

Abstract: We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model
(LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368
economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to
replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds
(2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human
experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth,
unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against
100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We
report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve
remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically
significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025
data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance
on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample
period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting
advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be
omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results
provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even
on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data,
while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts
compared to human panels.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Smart-Hiring is an NLP pipeline for automated resume screening and candidate-job matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual resume screening is time-consuming, error-prone, and biased.

Method: The system uses document parsing, named-entity recognition, and contextual text embedding to extract information and match candidates with job descriptions using a shared vector space.

Result: Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate competitive matching accuracy with interpretability and transparency.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a scalable NLP framework for recruitment analytics and suggests future work in bias mitigation and fairness-aware modeling.

Abstract: Hiring processes often involve the manual screening of hundreds of resumes
for each job, a task that is time and effort consuming, error-prone, and
subject to human bias. This paper presents Smart-Hiring, an end-to-end Natural
Language Processing (NLP) pipeline de- signed to automatically extract
structured information from unstructured resumes and to semantically match
candidates with job descriptions. The proposed system combines document
parsing, named-entity recognition, and contextual text embedding techniques to
capture skills, experience, and qualifications. Using advanced NLP technics,
Smart-Hiring encodes both resumes and job descriptions in a shared vector space
to compute similarity scores between candidates and job postings. The pipeline
is modular and explainable, allowing users to inspect extracted entities and
matching rationales. Experiments were conducted on a real-world dataset of
resumes and job descriptions spanning multiple professional domains,
demonstrating the robustness and feasibility of the proposed approach. The
system achieves competitive matching accuracy while preserving a high degree of
interpretability and transparency in its decision process. This work introduces
a scalable and practical NLP frame- work for recruitment analytics and outlines
promising directions for bias mitigation, fairness-aware modeling, and
large-scale deployment of data-driven hiring solutions.

Abstract: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in
education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge
Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational
questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing
KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill
tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important
source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while
limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing
(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using
pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories
and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in
both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves
performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better
to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of
question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained
representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

### [16] [CGES: Confidence-Guided Early Stopping for Efficient and Accurate Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02603)
*Ehsan Aghazadeh,Ahmad Ghasemi,Hedyeh Beyhaghi,Hossein Pishro-Nik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为 Confidence-Guided Early Stopping (CGES) 的新方法，旨在减少大型语言模型在测试时进行多次查询的需求，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 self-consistency 策略需要固定数量的调用，并且在正确答案很少见时可能会失败。

Method: CGES 是一个贝叶斯框架，它使用从 token 概率或奖励模型导出的标量置信度信号来形成候选答案的后验分布。CGES 会在候选者的后验概率超过阈值时自适应地停止抽样。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，CGES 将平均模型调用次数减少了约 69%（例如，从 16.0 减少到 4.9），同时在 0.06 个百分点内匹配了 self-consistency 的准确性。

Conclusion: CGES 是一种有效的方法，可以在减少计算成本的同时保持大型语言模型的准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often queried multiple times at test time,
with predictions aggregated by majority vote. While effective, this
self-consistency strategy (arXiv:2203.11171) requires a fixed number of calls
and can fail when the correct answer is rare. We introduce Confidence-Guided
Early Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework that forms posteriors over
candidate answers using scalar confidence signals derived from token
probabilities or reward models. CGES adaptively halts sampling once the
posterior mass of a candidate exceeds a threshold. We provide theoretical
guarantees for both perfectly calibrated confidences and realistic noisy
confidence signals. Across five reasoning benchmarks, CGES reduces the average
number of model calls by about 69 percent (for example, from 16.0 to 4.9) while
matching the accuracy of self-consistency within 0.06 percentage points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TRACE的框架，用于解决大型语言模型（LLM）与人类价值观对齐的问题，该框架能够以可扩展、动态和经济高效的方式保持LLM的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型在与人类价值观对齐方面存在差距，导致模型难以适应不断变化的规范和策略，并且重新对齐的成本很高。

Method: TRACE框架通过程序化的方式，根据新策略对现有偏好数据进行分类，识别高影响的冲突，并通过混合优化来精确地反转、丢弃或保留偏好，同时保护模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，TRACE可以在不同的模型系列中实现强大的重新对齐，并且在复杂策略转变下，能够执行新的原则，而不会降低模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: TRACE为保持LLM对齐提供了一个可扩展、动态和经济高效的范例，为可持续和负责任的AI部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to
their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and
costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and
policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a
growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate:
large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning
methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise
policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict
Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives
re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE
programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy,
identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a
hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences
while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE
achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B,
Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B). On both synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF
dataset under complex policy shift, TRACE enforces new principles without
degrading general capabilities. Our work establishes a scalable, dynamic, and
cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation
for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在微调大型语言模型时引入新知识导致的事实性幻觉问题，发现特定知识类型的高度不熟悉性是导致幻觉的主要因素。为了缓解这个问题，论文提出了一种名为KnownPatch的方法，通过在训练后期加入少量已知知识样本来有效减轻新知识引入导致的幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究没有深入调查大型语言模型在微调过程中引入新知识时产生幻觉的具体表现和潜在机制。

Method: 1. 设计了一个受控数据集Biography-Reasoning，用于细粒度地分析多种知识类型和两种任务类型（知识问答和知识推理任务）。
2. 提出了KnownPatch方法，通过在训练后期加入少量已知知识样本来缓解新知识引入导致的幻觉。
3. 通过注意力分析，研究了学习新知识如何影响模型对问题中关键实体的注意力。

Result: 1. 当在完全由新知识组成的数据集上进行微调时，大型语言模型表现出显著增加的幻觉倾向。
2. 特定知识类型的高度不熟悉性是导致幻觉的主要因素，并且这种倾向会影响知识问答任务中的其他知识类型。
3. KnownPatch方法有效地缓解了新知识学习对模型关注关键实体的干扰，并提高了性能。

Conclusion: 新知识的引入会导致大型语言模型产生幻觉，而特定知识类型的高度不熟悉性是主要驱动因素。提出的KnownPatch方法可以有效缓解这种幻觉，并通过注意力分析揭示了幻觉产生的潜在机制。

Abstract: Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when
tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations.
However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific
manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work
addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and
conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task
types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning
tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge
type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased
hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a
particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,
is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect
other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we
propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in
the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced
hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge
reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing
excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of
hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar
contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar
questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge
learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved
performance.

TL;DR: 本文重点介绍了微调后预训练模型中参数更新的有效存储方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的巨大尺寸限制了存储和处理能力，因此需要更有效地存储微调后的模型。

Method: 我们利用微调更新是低秩和稀疏的这一观察结果，并提出了一种选择性地稀疏化低秩近似更新的方法，通过利用奇异向量的交错重要性，确保保留最具影响力的成分。

Result: 我们通过广泛的实验证明，与单独采用低秩近似或稀疏化相比，我们提出的方法在相同的内存预算内实现了显着的存储效率和卓越的准确性。

Conclusion: 我们证明了稀疏化低秩近似与较大秩优于具有较小秩的标准低秩近似。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse
applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing
capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most
applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,
even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant
challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show
that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,
highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This
paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models
after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that
fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for
storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or
sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model
expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified
low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank
approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,
optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated
updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring
that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage
efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to
employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

Motivation: 之前的翻译理论广泛讨论了语用显化现象，但很少有计算模型。

Method: 通过空对齐识别候选显化案例，并通过主动学习和人工标注进行改进。

Result: 实体和系统层面的显化最常见，主动学习将分类器准确率提高了7-8个百分点，在不同语言中达到高达0.88的准确率和0.82的F1值。

Conclusion: PragExTra 证实了语用显化是一种可衡量的跨语言现象，并朝着构建具有文化意识的机器翻译迈出了一步。

Abstract: Translators often enrich texts with background details that make implicit
cultural meanings explicit for new audiences. This phenomenon, known as
pragmatic explicitation, has been widely discussed in translation theory but
rarely modeled computationally. We introduce PragExTra, the first multilingual
corpus and detection framework for pragmatic explicitation. The corpus covers
eight language pairs from TED-Multi and Europarl and includes additions such as
entity descriptions, measurement conversions, and translator remarks. We
identify candidate explicitation cases through null alignments and refined
using active learning with human annotation. Our results show that entity and
system-level explicitations are most frequent, and that active learning
improves classifier accuracy by 7-8 percentage points, achieving up to 0.88
accuracy and 0.82 F1 across languages. PragExTra establishes pragmatic
explicitation as a measurable, cross-linguistic phenomenon and takes a step
towards building culturally aware machine translation. Keywords: translation,
multilingualism, explicitation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨低资源语言国家人工智能普及率较低的原因。

Method: 使用加权回归模型来分离语言因素与社会经济和人口因素。

Result: 低资源语言国家的人工智能用户份额比基线低约20%。

Conclusion: 语言可访问性是实现公平人工智能普及的重要且独立的障碍。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is diffusing globally at unprecedented speed,
but adoption remains uneven. Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to
perform poorly on low-resource languages due to data scarcity. We hypothesize
that this performance deficit reduces the utility of AI, thereby slowing
adoption in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs). To test this, we use a
weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and
demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is
approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that
linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI
diffusion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种集中式多 LLM 框架，通过控制器 LLM 有选择地协调专家模型池，从而实现经济高效且成本可控的方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在不同领域表现出互补的优势，并且推理成本各不相同，因此需要设计多智能体 LLM 系统，以便专业模型能够高效协作。现有方法主要依赖于分散式框架，每次输入都会调用多个 LLM，从而导致大量且不受控制的推理成本。

Method: 将此协调问题表述为具有双重目标的强化学习：在最大化任务性能的同时，最小化总体推理成本。此外，我们希望多智能体系统在推理期间具有适应不同预算条件的行为。为此，我们提出 CoRL，这是一个强化学习框架，可在可控的多预算设置中优化性能成本权衡。

Result: 在四个不同的基准测试中进行的实验表明，在高预算设置下，CoRL 使单个系统能够超越最佳专家 LLM，同时在更经济的低预算模式下保持强大的性能，突出了集中协调对于可扩展且经济高效的多智能体 LLM 系统的有效性。

Conclusion: 集中式协调对于可扩展且经济高效的多智能体 LLM 系统是有效的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains
and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM
systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for
every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In
this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller
LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and
cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as
reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while
minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent
system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during
inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework
that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget
setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a
single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while
maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes,
highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and
cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemSearcher: An agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact memory and combines the current turn with it to stabilize context length across multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search agents either use the entire interaction history, leading to high costs, or only the current turn, discarding essential information, which limits scalability.

Method: MemSearcher fuses the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for solving the task. Multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents is introduced.

Result: MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher even outperforms 7B-based baselines.

Conclusion: Balancing information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM
context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,
resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the
current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This
trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,
we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact
memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses
the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform
search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for
solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn
interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize
this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that
jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of
MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of
trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level
advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as
Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines
on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher
even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance
between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and
lower computational overhead. The code and models will be publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Oolong是一个长文本推理任务的基准，它要求模型在上下文中分析和聚合大量文本块，以回答分布问题。即使是先进的模型在Oolong上也表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本评估主要依赖于从上下文中检索信息，这忽略了对上下文中每个token的分析。Oolong旨在解决这个问题，它通过要求模型进行细粒度的文本分析和聚合来评估长文本推理能力。

Method: Oolong包含两个任务集：Oolong-synth（合成任务）和Oolong-real（真实对话数据任务）。这些任务要求模型进行分类、计数，并推理时间和用户关系。

Result: GPT-5、Claude-Sonnet-4和Gemini-2.5-Pro在128K上下文长度下，在Oolong的两个任务集上的准确率均低于50%。

Conclusion: Oolong的发布旨在促进能够对大量文本进行推理的模型的进一步发展。

Abstract: As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models
effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully
designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these
evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,
which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This
represents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We
introduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require
analyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating
these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two
task sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can
easily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a
downstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational
data. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to
perform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over
temporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy
on both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong
to enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities
of text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文旨在构建一个能够理解视觉和语言信息并生成相应动作的VLA模型，特别是在机器人操作任务中。

Method: 该模型使用了一个双层动作表示框架，该框架联合监督视觉-语言模型(VLM)和动作专家，并结合机器人轨迹数据与通用QA和空间QA数据集的混合训练策略。

Result: 在LIBERO Franka基准测试和真实世界的评估中，iFlyBot-VLA都表现出了优越的性能。

Conclusion: iFlyBot-VLA模型在各种具有挑战性的操作任务中取得了有竞争力的成功率，并且计划开源部分自建数据集以支持社区未来的研究。

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

TL;DR: 评估在低类间变异性条件下，胎儿超声(US)成像中基础模型的性能。重点关注胎儿脑标准平面——经丘脑(TT)、经脑室(TV)和经小脑(TC)，这些平面具有高度重叠的解剖特征，对可靠的生物特征评估提出了关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨 vision foundation 模型（如 DINOv3）在医学领域的可迁移性，以及它们区分解剖结构相似结构的能力。

Method: 1) 统一多中心基准 FetalUS-188K，包含超过 188,000 张带注释的图像。2) 以自监督方式对 DINOv3 进行预训练，以学习超声感知表征。3) 通过标准化适应协议评估学习到的特征，包括线性探测和完全微调。

Result: 在胎儿超声数据上预训练的模型始终优于在自然图像上初始化的模型，加权 F1 值提高了 20%。

Conclusion: 通用基础模型在低类间变异性下无法泛化，而特定领域的预训练对于在胎儿脑超声成像中获得稳健且临床可靠的表征至关重要。

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

TL;DR: GFMs在卫星图像洪水制图中优于传统模型U-Net，精度更高，计算成本和标注工作量更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GFMs在洪水制图任务中是否优于传统模型，并指导用户选择模型。

Method: 对比Prithvi 2.0、Clay V1.5、DOFA、UViT、TransNorm、U-Net和Attention U-Net在PlanetScope、Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2上的性能。

Result: Clay在PlanetScope和Sentinel-2上表现最佳，Prithvi在Sentinel-1上表现最佳。Clay在跨区域交叉验证中表现略好，并且在少量样本实验中优于Prithvi和DOFA。Clay模型尺寸更小，速度更快。

Conclusion: GFMs在洪水制图精度方面提供小到中等的改进，同时降低了计算成本和标注工作量，优于传统U-Net模型。

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于学习的图像重建框架，用于解决不完整测量问题，包括上采样和图像修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督方法需要完全采样的Ground Truth数据，而自监督方法允许不完整的Ground Truth，但通常依赖于随机采样，期望覆盖整个图像。本文考虑了固定的、确定性的采样模式，即使在期望中也具有固有的不完整覆盖。

Method: 本文利用底层图像分布的多种不变性，理论上可以实现与完全监督方法相同的重建性能。

Result: 本文在光声显微镜(PAM)中的光学分辨率图像上采样上验证了该方法，证明了在需要更少的Ground Truth数据的情况下，具有竞争性或更优越的结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的图像重建方法，该方法可以在不完全采样的情况下实现与完全监督方法相当的性能。

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型多模态模型（LMM）在医学图像中检测受保护健康信息（PHI）的应用，并与传统OCR模型进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中PHI的检测对于保护患者隐私至关重要。传统方法依赖于OCR和命名实体识别，但LMM的进步为文本提取和语义分析提供了新机会。

Method: 研究系统地评估了三种LMM（GPT-4o、Gemini 2.5 Flash和Qwen 2.5 7B），使用了两种pipeline配置：仅文本分析和OCR与语义分析相结合。

Result: LMM展现出优越的OCR效果，但在整体PHI检测准确性方面并不总是更好。在复杂图像模式的测试用例中，性能提升最为显著。当文本区域清晰可读时，不同pipeline配置产生相似的结果。

Conclusion: 研究为LMM选择提供了经验性建议，并提出了利用可扩展模块化基础设施的部署策略。

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

Motivation: Lack of comprehensive datasets capturing strength-demanding activities for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power.

Method: Collected IMU signals from 29 subjects performing 11 strength-demanding activities and 2 non-strength demanding activities, using 10 IMUs placed on limbs and torso, and annotated using video recordings. Compared joint angles estimated by IMUs with those from video.

Result: The dataset's accuracy and reliability were validated through comparative analysis between IMU-estimated joint angles and those extracted from video.

Conclusion: StrengthSense can be utilized to advance human activity recognition algorithms and create fitness/health monitoring applications.

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

Result: 生成了包含约72K个QA对的大规模文本VQA数据集，该数据集基于约44K张图像。

Conclusion: 这是第一个被提出的自动合成和验证大规模文本VQA数据集的流程。

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种仅使用深度信息的、无标记的增强现实（AR）配准流程，并在头戴式显示器上进行了临床评估，评估了在真实手术环境中小型或低曲率解剖结构上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估在小型或低曲率解剖结构上使用头戴式显示器的深度信息无标记AR配准流程的准确性，以改进临床就绪的无标记AR引导。

Method: 在HoloLens 2上，通过深度偏差校正、人工初始化以及全局和局部配准，将AHAT深度与CT衍生的皮肤网格对齐。使用AR跟踪工具，通过比较“皮肤到骨骼”的相对距离与CT真值来验证表面跟踪误差指标。进行了七次术中目标试验（脚2次，耳朵3次，腿2次）。

Result: 临床前验证显示AR跟踪距离和CT距离之间具有良好的一致性。临床上，每个点的误差中位数为3.9 mm。按解剖结构划分，误差中位数分别为3.2 mm（脚）、4.3 mm（耳朵）和5.3 mm（小腿）。

Conclusion: 在没有基准标记的情况下，HMD上的深度信息无标记AR流程在实际手术环境中，在脚、耳朵和小腿上实现了约3-4 mm的中位数误差，接近中等风险任务的典型临床误差阈值。人工引导初始化加上全局到局部的配准，实现了在小型或低曲率目标上的精确对齐，提高了无标记AR引导的临床就绪性。

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

Conclusion: 该工作为数字有孔虫生长分析提供了第一个全自动和可重复的流程，为大规模、数据驱动的生态研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确量化路面裂缝宽度对于评估结构完整性和指导维护干预至关重要。然而，由于裂缝边界的复杂性和不均匀性，以及需要从任意像素位置进行快速测量以促进全面的路面状况评估，实现精确的裂缝宽度测量面临着巨大的挑战。

Method: 该方法包括三个阶段：(1) 使用已建立的检测算法进行初始裂缝分割，以生成二元表示；(2) 通过PCA确定准平行裂缝的主要方向轴；(3) 使用RPCA提取不规则裂缝几何形状的主要传播轴 (MPA)。

Result: 在三个公开可用的数据集上进行了综合评估，结果表明，与现有的最先进技术相比，该方法在计算效率和测量精度方面均实现了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的裂缝宽度提取方法，并在公开数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

Motivation: 理解和减轻光强快速变化引起的闪烁效应对提高事件相机在各种环境中的性能至关重要。

Method: 利用卷积神经网络（CNN）识别空间中的闪烁，并动态调整特定偏置以减少其影响。

Result: 在良好和低光照条件下，以及各种频率下，使用面部检测器框架对自偏置系统的有效性进行了测试，结果表明面部检测的YOLO置信度提高，捕获检测到面部的帧的百分比增加，平均梯度降低。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力显著提高事件相机在各种不利光照场景中的功能。

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
adverse lighting scenarios.

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over
video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the
referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed
approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video
Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key
contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve
the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the
previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

Motivation: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis relies on expensive and limited Abeta-PET. This study aims to predict Abeta-PET spatial patterns from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans to address these limitations.

Method: A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET images from Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs collected from 566 participants.

Result: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans. Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). The synthetic PET-based model outperforms T1-based and BBM-based models. Combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance.

Conclusion: The language-enhanced generative model synthesizes realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的应变估计技术需要大量的人工干预和专业知识，效率低且资源密集，不适合监测。

Method: 该研究比较了两种深度学习方法：基于RAFT光流模型的TeeFlow和基于CoTracker点轨迹模型的TeeTracker，用于经食道超声心动图(TEE)中的SLS估计。

Result: 在合成TEE数据集上，TeeTracker在准确性方面优于TeeFlow，运动估计的平均距离误差为0.65毫米。在16名患者的临床验证表明，autoStrain流程的SLS估计与临床参考对齐，平均差异为1.09%（-8.90%至11.09%）。

Conclusion: 将人工智能驱动的运动估计与TEE相结合可以显著提高临床环境中心脏功能评估的精度和效率。

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Method: 使用真实世界的移动AR数据，评估了基础模型在几何感知图像扭曲方面的改进。

Result: 基础模型在几何感知图像扭曲方面提供了显著的改进，并展示了其在3D场景重建中的领先性能。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了将基础模型集成到移动稀疏传感系统中的前景和挑战。

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

*Delin Ma,Menghui Zhou,Jun Qi,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于基于MRI和PET的AD诊断的协同注意和一致引导融合框架，该框架通过引入可学习参数表示（LPR）块来补偿缺失的模态信息，并采用一致性引导机制来对齐跨模态的潜在分布，从而提高诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要强调跨模态互补性，而忽略了模态特异性特征的诊断重要性。此外，模态之间固有的分布差异通常会导致有偏差和嘈杂的表示，从而降低分类性能。

Method: 该模型引入了一个可学习参数表示（LPR）块，以补偿缺失的模态信息，然后是一个共享编码器和模态独立编码器，以保留共享和特定表示。此外，采用一种一致性引导机制来显式地对齐跨模态的潜在分布。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法与现有的融合策略相比，实现了优越的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的MRI和PET融合框架，通过协同注意和一致性引导，有效提高了AD诊断的准确性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种潜在特征对齐方法，以提高内窥镜视频中绝对深度估计的准确性，通过对抗学习和定向特征一致性学习潜在的域不变特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从手术场景中的内窥镜相机获得绝对深度比较困难，这限制了在真实内窥镜图像上进行深度监督学习。当前图像级的无监督域适应方法虽然可以将具有已知深度图的合成图像转换为真实内窥镜帧的风格，并使用这些转换后的图像及其对应的深度图来训练深度网络，但是真实图像和转换后的合成图像之间仍然存在域差距。

Method: 该深度网络以转换后的合成图像和真实的内窥镜帧作为输入，并通过对抗学习和定向特征一致性学习潜在的域不变特征。

Result: 在中心气道体模的内窥镜视频上进行的评估表明，与目前最好的MDE方法相比，该方法在绝对和相对深度指标上都取得了优异的性能，并且在各种骨干网络和预训练权重上都能持续提高结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种潜在特征对齐方法，可以有效缩小真实图像和合成图像之间的域差距，提高内窥镜视频中绝对深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有的医学报告生成模型在病灶描述方面面临领域知识理解不足、文本-视觉实体嵌入对齐差以及跨模态偏差引起的虚假相关性等挑战，并且以往的工作只关注于解决单个挑战。

Method: 该框架采用分层任务分解方法，将挑战分为低、中、高三个层级，分别通过医学实体特征与空间位置对齐、前缀语言建模和掩码图像建模的互相指导以及跨模态因果干预模块来解决。

Result: 实验结果表明，HTSC-CIF 显著优于当前最先进的医学报告生成方法，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: HTSC-CIF 框架能够有效解决医学报告生成中病灶描述所面临的领域知识不足、文本-视觉实体嵌入对齐差以及跨模态偏差引起的虚假相关性等三大挑战，并显著提升生成报告的质量。

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在三维计算机视觉中，物体姿态估计至关重要。当姿态不明确时，概率姿态输出有很多好处，但通常单点估计就足够了。

Method: 该论文探索使用欧拉角参数化作为姿态估计的归一化流模型的基础。

Result: 论文探索了欧拉角的想法，尽管有其缺点，但在许多方面可能产生有用的模型，相比于建立在更复杂的参数化上的模型。

Conclusion: 尽管欧拉角存在不足，但与基于更复杂参数化的模型相比，它可能在某些方面带来有用的模型。

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

TL;DR: SAIL-RL是一种强化学习框架，旨在提高多模态大型语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于结果监督和统一的思考策略，导致推理质量不高或效率低下。

Method: SAIL-RL采用双重奖励系统，包括评估推理质量的思考奖励和判断是否需要深入推理的判断奖励。

Result: SAIL-RL在多个基准测试中提高了推理和多模态理解能力，并减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: SAIL-RL是一个构建更可靠和自适应的MLLM的有效框架。

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

Motivation: 利用图神经网络来进行手写数学表达式的识别。

Method: 使用深度BLSTM网络进行符号分割、识别和空间关系分类，形成初始的原始图。然后，一个2D-CFG解析器生成所有可能的空间关系，而基于GNN的链接预测模型通过移除不必要的连接来改进结构，最终形成符号标签图。

Abstract: We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for Handwritten
Mathematical Expression (HME) recognition by modeling HMEs as graphs, where
nodes represent symbols and edges capture spatial dependencies. A deep BLSTM
network is used for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation
classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then
generates all possible spatial relations, while the GNN-based link prediction
model refines the structure by removing unnecessary connections, ultimately
forming the Symbol Label Graph. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in HME structure
recognition.

TL;DR: 提出了一个稳健的全局相机姿态估计框架，名为Cycle-Sync，避免了捆绑调整的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机姿态估计是计算机视觉中的一个基本问题。现有的方法要么需要密集的场景重建，要么容易受到异常值的影响。

Method: 提出了一种位置求解器，该求解器将消息传递最小二乘法（MPLS）应用于相机位置估计，并修改MPLS以强调循环一致性信息，重新定义使用先前迭代中估计的距离的循环一致性，并结合Welsch型鲁棒损失。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，Cycle-Sync始终优于包括具有捆绑调整的完整运动结构管道在内的领先姿态估计器。

Conclusion: Cycle-Sync为相机姿态估计提供了一种稳健且全局的解决方案，具有最高的确定性精确恢复保证，并且在合成和真实数据集上都优于现有的姿态估计器。

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的 OOD 检测方法 GAFD-CC，该方法通过解耦特征并校准置信度来提高 OOD 检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 OOD 检测方法忽略了特征和 logits 之间的内在相关性，这对于有效的 OOD 检测至关重要。

Method: GAFD-CC 首先执行由分类权重引导的全局感知特征解耦，然后将这些解耦的特征与多尺度 logit-based 置信度自适应地融合。

Result: 在大型基准测试上的大量实验表明，GAFD-CC 具有与最先进的方法相比具有竞争力的性能和强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GAFD-CC 旨在改进决策边界并提高区分性能，从而实现更有效和鲁棒的 OOD 检测。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 目前的心血管疾病早期检测和管理方法依赖于专业设备，且易受运动伪影、光照变化和单视角限制的影响。现有的研究缺乏在心血管疾病患者中的可靠应用，且缺乏广泛使用的开放数据集。

Method: 提出了F3Mamba模型，该模型利用Mamba架构融合智能手机前后摄像头同步采集的面部和指尖视频信息。

Result: F3Mamba模型相比现有的单视角基线方法，心率误差降低了21.9%到30.2%，并在现实场景中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本研究通过提供公开的双视角MPPG数据集和提出的F3Mamba模型，为移动健康监测领域的心血管疾病管理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Portable physiological monitoring is essential for early detection and
management of cardiovascular disease, but current methods often require
specialized equipment that limits accessibility or impose impractical postures
that patients cannot maintain. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones
offers a convenient noninvasive alternative, yet it still faces reliability
challenges caused by motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view
constraints. Few studies have demonstrated reliable application to
cardiovascular patients, and no widely used open datasets exist for
cross-device accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce the M3PD
dataset, the first publicly available dual-view mobile photoplethysmography
dataset, comprising synchronized facial and fingertip videos captured
simultaneously via front and rear smartphone cameras from 60 participants
(including 47 cardiovascular patients). Building on this dual-view setting, we
further propose F3Mamba, which fuses the facial and fingertip views through
Mamba-based temporal modeling. The model reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to
30.2 percent over existing single-view baselines while improving robustness in
challenging real-world scenarios. Data and code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为CoCoVa的新视觉语言模型框架，该框架利用连续跨模态推理来处理各种视觉语言任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型(VLM)在离散和刚性的语言token空间内进行推理，限制了视觉感知丰富和高维的特性。

Method: CoCoVa的核心是一个迭代推理循环，其中一种新的潜在Q-Former (LQ-Former)作为动态推理引擎，通过跨模态融合迭代地细化潜在思想向量链。为了集中这个过程，token选择机制动态地识别显著的视觉区域，模仿注意力焦点。为了确保这些潜在的想法保持不变，我们使用结合了对比学习和基于扩散的重建的多任务目标来训练模型，从而加强潜在表示和视觉和文本模态之间的对齐。

Result: 评估表明，CoCoVa提高了精度和token效率，超过了强大的基线。在使用1.5B backbone时，它几乎在所有基准测试中都能与更大的7B-9B模型竞争或超过它们。当扩展到7B LLM backbone时，它仍然具有与最先进模型竞争的能力。

Conclusion: 定性分析验证了学习到的潜在空间捕获了可解释和结构化的推理模式，突出了CoCoVa弥合离散语言处理和连续视觉理解之间表示差距的潜力。

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target

is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the

histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the

### [55] [Purrturbed but Stable: Human-Cat Invariant Representations Across CNNs, ViTs and Self-Supervised ViTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02404)
*Arya Shah,Vaibhav Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究量化了猫和人类在视觉表征上的一致性，发现自监督ViT模型在早期阶段的特征能够更好地桥接物种特异性统计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 猫和人类的眼睛结构不同，特别是猫的垂直瞳孔与伏击捕食有关，但这种特殊性如何在下游视觉表征中体现尚不清楚。

Method: 使用统一的、冻结编码器的基准，通过分层中心核对齐（线性和RBF）和表征相似性分析，量化了卷积网络、监督Vision Transformers、windowed transformers和自监督ViT（DINO）中猫与人类的跨物种表征对齐。

Result: DINO ViT-B/16模型获得了最显著的对齐（平均CKA-RBF≈0.814，平均CKA-线性≈0.745，平均RSA≈0.698），在早期模块达到峰值。监督ViT在CKA上具有竞争力，但在几何对应上比DINO弱。CNNs仍然是强大的基线，但在对齐方面低于普通ViT，windowed transformers的表现不如普通ViT。

Conclusion: 自监督与ViT归纳偏置相结合，产生的表征几何比广泛使用的CNN和windowed Transformers更接近猫和人类的视觉系统，为跨物种视觉计算的收敛方式提供了可验证的神经科学假设。

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决弱光图像增强问题，有效处理光照变化和噪声。

Method: 首先将图像分解为反射和光照分量，然后使用条件修正流框架表示光照变化，并引入去噪网络去除反射噪声。

Result: 在弱光增强和曝光校正方面，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IllumFlow 能够精确地适应各种光照条件，并自然地支持可定制的亮度增强。

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

Abstract: Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are
highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information,
allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its
environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs)
have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling
domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks,
combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity
poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of
Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and
inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of
state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action
Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to
edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is
evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape,

Motivation: 精确恢复缺失或遮挡区域对于稳健的图像分析至关重要。现有方法依赖于需要大量重新训练的预处理模型或具有显着计算开销的后处理模型。

Method: KAO引入了一种潜在空间条件方法，优化了一个紧凑的潜在空间，以实现高效准确的修复。此外，我们将显式传播纳入扩散过程，促进正向-反向融合，从而提高方法的稳定性和精度。

Result: 实验结果表明，KAO为VHR卫星图像修复树立了新的基准。

Conclusion: KAO提供了一种可扩展、高性能的解决方案，该解决方案平衡了预处理模型的效率和后处理模型的灵活性。

Abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where
accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image
analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes
Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image
inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by
very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the
Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on
preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models
with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space
Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient
and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into
the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the
stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that
KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a
scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of
preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的方法只关注从整个视频中识别单个动作的任务设置，不适用于最近流行的时空动作识别（STAR）设置。

Method: 该方法引入了一个新的基于Transformer的视角间协作模块，该模块利用特征图进行有效协作，并划分相同和不同视角的自注意力。

Result: 在新收集的数据集上进行的实验结果表明，MVAFormer的F-measure比比较基线高出约4.4个百分点。

Conclusion: MVAFormer在时空动作识别设置中表现出色，优于现有基线。

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

Motivation: 现有的逆渲染、新视角合成和重照明技术主要依赖于合成数据集进行训练，以及小规模的真实世界数据集进行基准测试，这限制了它们的真实性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用35台数码单反相机和331个独立控制的光源捕获765个真实世界物体的图像，从而模拟不同的光照条件。此外，还提供校准后的相机参数、精确的物体掩模、光度表面法线和漫反射反照率作为辅助资源。

Result: 构建了一个广泛的评估集，为逆渲染和法线估计建立了第一个全面的真实世界物体中心基准。

Conclusion: OLATverse代表了将下一代逆渲染和重照明方法与真实世界数据集成的一个关键步骤。

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly
released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in
tasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to
the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available
datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we
introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k
high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos
covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data
are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding
boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications
such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers
clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data
quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world
scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,
including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and
vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset
to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available
at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.

TL;DR: UniChange是首个基于多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）的统一变化检测模型，它通过集成生成式语言能力和专门的变化检测功能，成功地统一了二元变化检测（BCD）和语义变化检测（SCD）任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常从单一类型的标注数据中获取有限的知识，并且无法同时利用不同的二元变化检测（BCD）和语义变化检测（SCD）数据集，导致泛化能力差和多功能性有限。

Method: 利用MLLM的语言先验知识和统一能力，开发了UniChange模型，通过引入三个特殊token：[T1]、[T2]和[CHANGE]，并使用文本提示来引导变化类别的识别，从而消除了对预定义分类头的依赖。

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集（WHU-CD、S2Looking、LEVIR-CD+和SECOND）上进行了实验，证明了UniChange的SOTA性能，IoU分数分别为90.41、53.04、78.87和57.62，超过了所有以前的方法。

Conclusion: UniChange模型有效地从多源数据集中获取知识，即使它们的类定义冲突。

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

Result: 研究发现，最佳专业化路径依赖于任务。对于视觉任务，SFT和ICL高度互补，微调模型在上下文感知示例的指导下实现了最高的平均性能（Micro-F1为0.728）。对于文本任务，大型基础模型上的ICL是更优越的策略，达到了0.847的峰值Micro-F1，优于强大的“超级专家”SFT模型（0-shot Micro-F1为0.839）。

Conclusion: 在科学人工智能领域，最佳专业化路径依赖于任务模式，这为开发更有效的基于科学的代理系统提供了一个清晰的框架。

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing,
involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative,
convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been
manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video
editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often
fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To
address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for
video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching
between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to
obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we
segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such
as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models
to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their
alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization
by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the
assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the
arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,
narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style
of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual
expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience
can create visually compelling videos. Project page:

### [68] [VCode: a Multimodal Coding Benchmark with SVG as Symbolic Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02778)
*Kevin Qinghong Lin,Yuhao Zheng,Hangyu Ran,Dantong Zhu,Dongxing Mao,Linjie Li,Philip Torr,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的基准测试VCode，用于评估模型从图像生成SVG代码的能力，并提出了一个名为VCoder的框架来提高模型在视觉中心编码任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究主要集中在以语言为中心的任务上，而对以视觉为中心的编码任务探索不足。受人类如何推理草图的启发，论文提倡使用SVG代码作为一种紧凑、可解释和可执行的视觉表示。

Method: 论文提出了VCode基准测试，该测试将多模态理解重新定义为代码生成。此外，论文还提出了VCoder框架，该框架通过迭代分析差异并改进SVG代码，以及利用检测器和解析器提供结构化线索来增强VLM。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有的VLM难以生成忠实的SVG代码。VCoder框架在多个基准测试中都取得了显著的性能提升，并且在专业知识和3D推理方面有所改进。

Conclusion: 论文表明，符号视觉表示具有潜力，并强调了语言中心和视觉中心编码之间仍然存在差距。VCoder框架的成功表明，通过结合修订和视觉工具，可以有效地提高VLM在视觉中心编码任务中的性能。

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated
example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public

*Jee Won Lee,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteVoxel: A self-tuning pipeline enhancing sparse-voxel rasterization for scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-voxel rasterization struggles with low-frequency content, brittle pruning, and high VRAM usage.

Method: Inverse-Sobel reweighting, depth-quantile pruning with EMA-hysteresis, and ray-footprint-based subdivision.

Result: Mitigates low-frequency errors and boundary instability, maintains PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS, reduces peak VRAM by 40%-60%.

Conclusion: LiteVoxel enables more predictable, memory-efficient training without sacrificing perceptual quality by addressing the limitations of sparse-voxel rasterization.

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

Motivation: 剪切干涉术是一种用于检测地下缺陷的无损检测方法，但其工业应用因需要专家解释而受到限制。

Result: 结果表明，学生-教师方法实现了卓越的分类鲁棒性，并能够进行精确定位。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了无监督深度学习在工业环境中可扩展、标签高效的剪切干涉检测中的潜力。

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

Method: 本文实现了五个深度学习架构（UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet）并在两个纵向队列（ADNI 和 AIBL）上进行了评估。

Result: 结果表明，表现最佳的模型实现了高保真预测，并且所有模型都能很好地推广到独立的外部数据集，证明了强大的跨队列性能。

Conclusion: 深度学习可以可靠地预测个体层面的脑部 MRI，为个体化预后提供了新的机会。

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的全球基准数据集无法很好地捕捉印度城市交通的异质性，因此需要一个专门针对印度交通场景的数据集。

Method: 该数据集包含从班加罗尔的监控摄像头捕获的 26,646 张图像，这些图像通过众包黑客马拉松的方式进行标注，使用了多数投票和 STAPLE 算法来获得共识标注。此外，还使用该数据集训练了 YOLO11-S/X、RT-DETR-S/X 和 DAMO-YOLO-T/L 等模型。

Result: 在 UVH-26 上训练的模型在 mAP50:95 指标上比在 COCO 数据集上训练的模型有显著提升，RT-DETR-X 模型表现最佳，达到 0.67 (mAP50:95)，而 COCO 训练的权重对于常见类别（汽车、公共汽车和卡车）的 mAP50:95 为 0.40。

Conclusion: UVH-26 填补了现有全球基准数据集的空白，为在新兴国家复杂交通条件下推进智能交通系统的检测、分类和部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种参数高效的框架 MTF-CVReID，用于解决跨视角视频行人重识别中的视角变化、尺度差异和时间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视角视频行人重识别由于视角变化、尺度差异和时间不一致仍然是一个开放问题。

Method: 在 ViT-B/16 主干网络上引入了七个互补模块，包括跨流特征归一化（CSFN）、多分辨率特征协调（MRFH）、身份感知记忆模块（IAMM）、时间动态建模（TDM）、跨视角特征对齐（IVFA）、分层时间模式学习（HTPL）和多视角身份一致性学习（MVICL）。

Result: 在 AG-VPReID 基准测试中，所有高度级别上都取得了最先进的性能，并且对 G2A-VReID 和 MARS 数据集具有很强的跨数据集泛化能力。该方法只增加了大约 200 万个参数和 0.7 GFLOPs，但保持了实时效率（189 FPS）。

Conclusion: 精心设计的基于适配器的模块可以显著增强跨视角鲁棒性和时间一致性，而不会影响计算效率。

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without
compromising computational efficiency. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于跨对象泛化和大脑信号的复杂性带来的挑战，先前的主题不可知的大脑解码方向尚未被充分探索。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的分层解码框架，即视觉皮层流架构(VCFlow)，该框架显式地模拟了人类视觉系统的腹侧-背侧结构，以学习多维表征。此外，我们引入了一种特征级对比学习策略，以增强受试者不变语义表征的提取，从而增强受试者对先前未见过的受试者的不可知适用性。

Result: VCFlow在平均牺牲7%准确率的情况下，在没有任何重新训练的情况下，在10秒内生成每个重建的视频，提供了一个快速且临床可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: VCFlow 是一种很有前景的临床应用解决方案，因为它不需要大量的特定对象数据和繁重的计算。

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 TAUE 的免训练框架，用于零样本、分层图像生成，解决了现有方法依赖微调或无法生成完整连贯场景的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像的扩散模型在专业应用中需要分层控制，但其输出的单一图像成为瓶颈。现有的解决方案要么依赖于使用大型数据集进行微调，要么是免训练的，但仅限于生成孤立的前景元素，无法生成完整且连贯的场景。

Method: 引入了噪声移植和培养扩散模型 (TAUE)，其核心技术是噪声移植和培养 (NTC)，从前景和复合生成过程中提取中间潜在表示，并将其移植到初始噪声中以供后续层使用。这确保了前景、背景和复合层之间的语义和结构一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该免训练方法达到了与微调方法相当的性能，增强了层间一致性，同时保持了高图像质量和保真度。

Conclusion: TAUE 不仅消除了昂贵的训练和数据集需求，还开启了新的下游应用，例如复杂的组合编辑，为更易于访问和控制的生成工作流程铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and
behavior. However, it remains a challenging task due to variations in habitat,

Conclusion: 验证了该架构的有效性，并通过演示视频展示了打印/显示、视频和wrap攻击检测方法。

Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,
we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了UniPruneBench，一个统一且可扩展的用于多模态LLM中视觉token剪枝的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型(LMMs)由于图像编码器引入的大量视觉tokens，常常遭受严重的推理效率低下问题。虽然最近的token压缩方法，如剪枝和合并，在减少冗余方面显示出希望，但它们的评估仍然是分散和不一致的。

Method: UniPruneBench提供了跨越六个能力维度和十个数据集的标准化协议，覆盖了十个代表性的压缩算法和三个LMMs家族(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3和Qwen2.5-VL)。除了任务准确性，它还整合了系统级指标，如运行时和预填充延迟，以提供一个整体的视角。

Result: 实验揭示了几个关键发现：(1)随机剪枝是一个非常强的基线，(2)没有一种方法在所有场景中始终优于其他方法，(3)剪枝敏感性在不同任务中差异显著，OCR最容易受到影响，(4)剪枝率是控制性能下降的主要因素。

Conclusion: UniPruneBench将为未来高效多模态建模的研究提供可靠的基础。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers 依赖于固定的 patch tokens，忽略了图像的空间和语义结构。

Method: 该方法使用带有信息标准的层级模型选择。

Result: 该方法在图像分类和密集预测任务中都具有竞争力，并且支持开箱即用的栅格到矢量转换。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种新的图像 tokenization 方法，可以提高 Vision Transformer 的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on fixed patch tokens that ignore the spatial and
semantic structure of images. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end
differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content with pixel-level
granularity while remaining backward-compatible with existing architectures for
retrofitting pretrained models. Our method uses hierarchical model selection
with information criteria to provide competitive performance in both
image-level classification and dense-prediction tasks, and even supports
out-of-the-box raster-to-vector conversion.

*Chao Yuan,Zanwu Liu,Guiwei Zhang,Haoxuan Xu,Yujian Zhao,Guanglin Niu,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的可见光-红外行人重识别框架，通过模态转换表示学习（MTRL）和一个中间生成的图像作为从可见光到红外模态的发射器，更有效地对齐跨模态特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 背景光照变化下，可见光和红外模态之间存在差距，现有方法主要依赖中间表示来对齐跨模态特征，但未充分利用中间特征。

Method: 通过中间生成的图像作为可见光到红外模态的转换器，并使用模态转换对比损失和模态查询正则化损失进行训练。

Result: 在三个典型的VI-ReID数据集上，该模型显著且持续地优于现有的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架不需要任何额外的参数，在提高VI-ReID任务性能的同时，实现了与骨干网络相同的推理速度。

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 探讨了在AI中发展类似于生物镜像神经元的模式，以促进内在对齐和伦理合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI对齐策略依赖外部约束，可能不足以应对未来的超智能AI。研究旨在探索是否人工神经网络可以发展出类似于生物镜像神经元的模式，从而促进AI的内在对齐。

Method: 使用Frog and Toad游戏框架，识别镜像神经元模式出现的条件，评估它们对动作回路的影响，引入检查点镜像神经元指数（CMNI）来量化激活强度和一致性，并提出了一个理论框架。

Result: 研究表明，适当的模型容量和自我/他人耦合可以促进人工神经网络中类似于生物镜像神经元的共享神经表示。这些类似共情的回路支持合作行为。

Conclusion: 通过镜像神经元动态建模的内在动机可以补充现有的对齐技术，通过将类共情机制直接嵌入到AI架构中。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities,
aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current
alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may
prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing
top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can
develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate
both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might
contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in
empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks:
(1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these
patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative
behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge,
evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror
Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and
propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and
self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to
biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative
behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron
dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding
empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型仍然局限于虚拟领域，而现实世界的实验和制造仍然依赖于人类的监督和专业知识。机器智能和物理执行之间的差距限制了科学和制造工作流程中的可重复性、可扩展性和可访问性。

Method: 本文提出了Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX)系统，通过混合现实将代理推理与物理执行相结合。APEX观察和解释人类行为，使它们与标准操作程序对齐，提供3D视觉指导，并分析每个步骤。

Result: APEX系统在柔性电子制造的洁净室中实现，实现了上下文感知推理，其准确性超过了通用多模态大型语言模型，实时纠正错误，并将专业知识传授给初学者。

Conclusion: 本文建立了一种新的代理-物理-人类智能，它将代理推理扩展到计算之外的物理领域，将科学研究和制造转变为自主、可追溯、可解释和可扩展的过程。

Abstract: Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures
that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and
decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation,
conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world
experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This
gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,
scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.
Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI
that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated
system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,
humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes
memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The
wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture
processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for
corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we
present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic
reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and
interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,
provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a
cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves
context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large
language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to
beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human
intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the
physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into
autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种使用大型模型自动设计强化学习（RL）奖励函数的方法，用于Gran Turismo 7赛车游戏，仅需文本指令即可生成有竞争力的赛车智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计强化学习智能体的奖励函数很困难，尤其是在复杂的环境中，如自动驾驶赛车。

Method: 结合了基于LLM的奖励生成、基于VLM的偏好评估和人工反馈。

Result: 生成的赛车智能体可以与冠军级的GT Sophy竞争，并能产生新颖的行为。

Conclusion: 该系统为实际应用中的自动奖励设计铺平了道路。

Abstract: When designing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, a designer communicates
the desired agent behavior through the definition of reward functions -
numerical feedback given to the agent as reward or punishment for its actions.
However, mapping desired behaviors to reward functions can be a difficult
process, especially in complex environments such as autonomous racing. In this
paper, we demonstrate how current foundation models can effectively search over
a space of reward functions to produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo
7 racing game, given only text-based instructions. Through a combination of
LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human
feedback we demonstrate how our system can be used to produce racing agents
competitive with GT Sophy, a champion-level RL racing agent, as well as
generate novel behaviors, paving the way for practical automated reward design
in real world applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了深度价值基准（DVB），用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）是否学习到根本的人类价值观，而不仅仅是表面偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI对齐的关键在于区分LLM是捕捉深层价值观还是表面模式，前者能更好地推广人类意图，后者可能产生不良行为。

Method: DVB采用了一种新颖的实验设计，通过控制深层价值观（如道德原则）和浅层特征（如表面属性）之间的混淆来评估模型。训练阶段使用故意关联深层和浅层特征的人类偏好数据，测试阶段打破这些关联。

Result: 在9个不同的模型中，平均深度价值泛化率（DVGR）仅为0.30，所有模型推广深层价值观的程度都低于偶然水平，较大的模型比小模型的DVGR略低。

Conclusion: DVB提供了一种可解释的对齐核心特征的度量方法，并发布了经过三个人工验证实验的数据集。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that
directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human
values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI
alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human
intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in
preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel
experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,
moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the
training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately
correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently
prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal
language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,
presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,
informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a
model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of
generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.
Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize
deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than
smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three
separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of
a core feature of alignment.

TL;DR: 洪水保险是个人减轻灾害相关损失的有效策略。然而，在美国，面临风险的人群的参与率仍然非常低。本文构建了一个基准数据集来捕捉跨因素的保险购买概率。利用这个数据集，评估了LLM的能力：虽然LLM表现出对因素的定性理解，但它们在估计定量概率方面有所欠缺。为了解决这个限制，本文提出了InsurAgent，这是一个由五个模块组成的LLM驱动的代理，包括感知、检索、推理、行动和记忆。检索模块利用检索增强生成（RAG）将决策建立在实证调查数据的基础上，实现了对边际和双变量概率的准确估计。推理模块利用LLM常识来推断调查数据之外的信息，捕捉传统模型难以处理的上下文信息。记忆模块支持时间决策演变的模拟，通过过山车生活轨迹进行说明。总体而言，InsurAgent为行为建模和政策分析提供了一个有价值的工具。

Motivation: 了解和建模保险决策背后的行为机制的需求。

Method: 构建一个基准数据集来捕捉跨因素的保险购买概率。提出了InsurAgent，一个LLM驱动的代理，包含五个模块：感知、检索、推理、行动和记忆。检索模块利用RAG，推理模块利用LLM常识，记忆模块支持时间决策演变模拟。

Result: LLM在估计定量概率方面有所欠缺。InsurAgent实现了对边际和双变量概率的准确估计，并捕捉了传统模型难以处理的上下文信息。

Conclusion: InsurAgent为行为建模和政策分析提供了一个有价值的工具。

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate
disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations
in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to
understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.
Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence
across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human
decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance
purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs
is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they
fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this
limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules
including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.
The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal
and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to
extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is
intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation
of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life
trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral
modeling and policy analysis.

Motivation: 为了提升奖励预测，尤其是在更长的推理和更大的模型中。

Method: 训练一个轻量级的适配器在推理模型上。

Result: 1) 在保持准确率的同时，减少了 26% 的计算量；2) 在同等计算量下，准确率提高了 4%，或者在同等准确率下，计算量减少了 55%；3) 在高计算量的情况下，准确率提高了 11%，在低计算量的情况下，准确率提高了 7%。

Conclusion: Re-FORC 允许通过每个 token 的成本阈值进行动态推理，并在前期估计计算时间。

Abstract: We propose Re-FORC, an adaptive reward prediction method that, given a
context, enables prediction of the expected future rewards as a function of the
number of future thinking tokens. Re-FORC trains a lightweight adapter on
reasoning models, demonstrating improved prediction with longer reasoning and
larger models. Re-FORC enables: 1) early stopping of unpromising reasoning
chains, reducing compute by 26% while maintaining accuracy, 2) optimized model
and thinking length selection that achieves 4% higher accuracy at equal compute
and 55% less compute at equal accuracy compared to the largest model, 3)
adaptive test-time scaling, which increases accuracy by 11% in high compute
regime, and 7% in low compute regime. Re-FORC allows dynamic reasoning with
length control via cost-per-token thresholds while estimating computation time
upfront.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个名为 ATHENA 的框架，用于更准确地模拟人类决策，特别是在疫苗接种等高风险情境中。该框架结合了大型语言模型 (LLM) 和效用理论，通过符号发现和语义适应来模拟群体和个体层面的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策模型在预测个体行为时，与群体最优预测存在偏差。这是因为个体决策过程受到数字属性和语言影响的双重影响。

Method: ATHENA 框架包含两个阶段：1) 通过 LLM 增强的符号发现，找到稳健的群体层面符号效用函数；2) 实现个体层面的语义适应，创建个性化的语义模板，以模拟个体选择。

Result: 在真实世界的旅行模式和疫苗选择任务中，ATHENA 的表现优于基于效用、机器学习和其他基于 LLM 的模型，F1 值至少提高了 6.5%。

Conclusion: ATHENA 通过整合符号效用建模和语义适应，为模拟以人为中心的决策提供了一种新方案。

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios
like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This
gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,
shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences
(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory
and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric
Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.
ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level
symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it
implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic
templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.
Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA
consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based
models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge
models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are
critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall
predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling
and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling
human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs)
has unlocked new frontiers in complex task-solving, enabling diverse agents to
integrate unique expertise, collaborate flexibly, and address challenges
unattainable for individual models. However, the full potential of such systems
is hindered by rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies
that fail to adapt to evolving task requirements. In this paper, we propose
STRMAC, a state-aware routing framework designed for efficient collaboration in
multi-agent systems. Our method separately encodes interaction history and
agent knowledge to power the router, which adaptively selects the most suitable
single agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that
accelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system
training. Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up
to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reducing data collection overhead by up
to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

Abstract: While existing work focuses primarily on task success, we argue that
effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity

personalization (adapting to diverse user preferences). We introduce UserVille,
an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse,
configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a
multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all

on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with
PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6

adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better
interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for
user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI

Abstract: Complex reasoning over tabular data is crucial in real-world data analysis,
yet large language models (LLMs) often underperform due to complex queries,
noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities. To address these issues, we
propose \method, a framework consisting of: (1) a query decomposer that breaks
down complex questions, (2) a table sanitizer that cleans and filters noisy
tables, and (3) a program-of-thoughts (PoT)-based reasoner that generates
executable code to derive the final answer from the sanitized table. To ensure
unbiased evaluation and mitigate data leakage, we introduce a new dataset,
CalTab151, specifically designed for complex numerical reasoning over tables.
Experimental results demonstrate that \method consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 8.79%, 6.08%, and
19.87% accuracy improvement on TAT-QA, TableBench, and \method, respectively.
Moreover, our framework integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs, providing a

Abstract: Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific
literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on
simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These
approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but
overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,
which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human
literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and
"keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.
Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using
the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the
scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established
research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework
to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures
keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven
ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to
iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A
critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by
providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our
experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by
10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference
acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in
scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each
component in the workflow. Code repo is available at

Conclusion: 相对不确定性和固有偏好是模态跟随的两个主要原则，为量化分析和深入了解 MLLM 如何解决冲突信息提供了框架和机制。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when
different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term
modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse
dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in
unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes
modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty
(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent
modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To
validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that
systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.
Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:
the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative
uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends
to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance
point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike
traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less
confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal
capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,
we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the
balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining
externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative
uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality
following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into
how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.

TL;DR: 本文致力于解决多智能体LLM推理中出现的“lazy agent behavior”问题，通过理论分析、因果影响测量和可验证的奖励机制来提升智能体之间的协作，从而充分发挥多智能体框架在复杂推理任务中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体LLM在复杂推理任务中表现出潜力，但存在“lazy agent behavior”的局限性，即一个智能体主导而另一个贡献较少，导致协作不充分。

Method: 1. 理论分析lazy behavior的成因。 2. 引入稳定的因果影响测量方法以缓解lazy behavior。 3. 提出可验证的奖励机制，鼓励推理智能体进行审议，丢弃噪声输出，整合指令，并在必要时重启推理过程。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能够有效缓解lazy agent behavior，并充分发挥多智能体框架在复杂推理任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架能够有效缓解多智能体LLM推理中的lazy agent behavior，并提升智能体之间的协作。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and
verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks.
Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a
meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning
agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite
promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,
in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining
collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this
paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior
naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and
efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.
Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost
in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter
this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by
allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate
instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and
unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning
tasks.

Motivation: 准确的预后预测对于及时干预和资源优化至关重要。

Method: 该方法集成了人口统计学、临床和实验室数据，采用基于量化的标记化方法处理连续实验室值，并使用注意力机制来提高可解释性。模型使用掩蔽语言建模进行预训练，并针对二元分类任务进行微调，预测从3a期到5期的进展。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，Transformer架构和时间设计选择在临床预后建模中的有效性，为个性化CKD治疗提供了有希望的方向。

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects nearly 10\% of the global population and
often progresses to end-stage renal failure. Accurate prognosis prediction is
vital for timely interventions and resource optimization. We present a
transformer-based framework for predicting CKD progression using multi-modal
electronic health records (EHR) from the Seoul National University Hospital
OMOP Common Data Model. Our approach (\textbf{ProQ-BERT}) integrates
demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, employing quantization-based
tokenization for continuous lab values and attention mechanisms for
interpretability. The model was pretrained with masked language modeling and
fine-tuned for binary classification tasks predicting progression from stage 3a
to stage 5 across varying follow-up and assessment periods. Evaluated on a
cohort of 91,816 patients, our model consistently outperformed CEHR-BERT,
achieving ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989 for short-term prediction.
These results highlight the effectiveness of transformer architectures and
temporal design choices in clinical prognosis modeling, offering a promising
direction for personalized CKD care.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality among women
worldwide, with early diagnosis being critical for effective treatment and
improved survival rates. However, timely detection continues to be a challenge
due to the complex nature of the disease and variability in patient risk
factors. This study presents a fuzzy soft set theory-based expert system
designed to assess the risk of breast cancer in patients using measurable
clinical and physiological parameters. The proposed system integrates Body Mass
Index, Insulin Level, Leptin Level, Adiponectin Level, and age as input
variables to estimate breast cancer risk through a set of fuzzy inference rules
and soft set computations. These parameters can be obtained from routine blood
analyses, enabling a non-invasive and accessible method for preliminary
assessment. The dataset used for model development and validation was obtained
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The proposed expert system aims to
support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and
determining the necessity of further diagnostic procedures such as biopsies.

Motivation: 现有的生成模型评估方法主要依赖于标量指标，而PR曲线的引入为研究提供了新的途径，但其估计仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于二元分类视角估计完整PR曲线的框架，并进行了全面的统计分析。

Result: 获得了PR估计风险的极小极大上界。该框架扩展了文献中一些具有里程碑意义的PR指标。

Conclusion: 通过实验研究了在各种设置下获得的曲线的不同行为。

Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question
of their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods
from the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision
and Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research.
The associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation
poses several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for
estimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We
conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a
byproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also
show that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature
which by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we
study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various
settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReAcTree是一种分层任务规划方法，通过将复杂目标分解为更易于管理的子目标来解决现有方法在复杂、长程任务中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于单一的轨迹，将所有过去的决策和观察纠缠在一起，试图在一个统一的过程中解决整个任务，导致难以处理复杂、长程任务。

Method: 提出了一种分层任务规划方法ReAcTree，该方法将复杂目标分解为动态构建的代理树中更易于管理的子目标。每个子目标由LLM代理节点处理，该节点能够进行推理、行动和进一步扩展树，而控制流节点协调代理节点的执行策略。此外，集成了两个互补的记忆系统：每个代理节点从情景记忆中检索特定于目标的、子目标级别的示例，并通过工作记忆共享特定于环境的观察结果。

Result: 在WAH-NL和ALFRED数据集上的实验表明，ReAcTree始终优于强大的任务规划基线，如ReAct。特别是在WAH-NL上，ReAcTree使用Qwen 2.5 72B实现了61%的目标成功率，几乎是ReAct的31%的两倍。

Conclusion: ReAcTree是一种有效的分层任务规划方法，可以在复杂、长程任务中实现比现有方法更好的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant
progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents.
However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks
because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions
and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified
process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical
task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable
subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled
by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the
tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent
nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent
node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and
shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on
the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently
outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.
Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5
72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的训练策略，用于提高大型语言模型在开放式任务中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽略了开放式任务中推理能力的潜在价值，并且RLVR方法依赖于标准答案，无法直接应用于开放式任务。

Method: 提出了可验证多项选择重构（VMR）方法，将开放式数据重构为可验证的多项选择形式。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，VMR方法在开放式任务上提高了LLM的性能，平均提升了5.99个点。

Conclusion: VMR方法能够有效地提高LLM在开放式任务中的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated great
potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), achieving remarkable progress in domains such as mathematics and
programming where standard answers are available. However, for open-ended tasks
lacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction
following), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,
thereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a
key question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended
tasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the
open domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose
the existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended
tasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice
Reformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended
data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even
in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM
performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,
our VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the
baseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.

Motivation: 5G和6G网络的复杂性使得手动优化效率低下，因此需要Agentic AI来自动化动态RAN环境中的决策。

Method: 本文首先介绍了Agentic AI，追溯了其从经典代理的演变，并讨论了从工作流和简单AI代理到Agentic AI的进展。然后描述了核心设计模式——反思、规划、工具使用和多代理协作——以说明如何协调智能行为。

Result: 一个实际的5G RAN案例研究表明，时间序列分析和LAM驱动的代理如何协同进行基于KPI的自主决策。

Conclusion: 本文为5G和6G网络中Agentic AI的持续研究做出了贡献，概述了其核心概念，并提出了一个将Agentic原则应用于RAN优化的实际用例。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using
Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with
multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will
lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals,
retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and
environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G
networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a
method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite
its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the
foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a
universally accepted definition.
  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G
networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case
that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic
AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress
from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design
patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then
described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These
theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus
on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how
time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based
autonomous decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频游戏的快速迭代和频繁更新对测试的效率和针对性提出了重大挑战。现有的基于大型语言模型的自动化游戏测试方法缺乏结构化的知识积累机制，难以进行精确和高效的增量更新测试。

Method: 该论文提出了一个KLPEG框架，该框架构建并维护一个知识图谱（KG）来系统地建模游戏元素、任务依赖和因果关系，从而实现跨版本的知识积累和重用。在此基础上，该框架利用大型语言模型来解析自然语言更新日志，并通过在KG上进行多跳推理来识别影响范围，从而生成针对更新的测试用例。

Result: 在Overcooked和Minecraft这两个代表性的游戏环境中进行的实验表明，KLPEG能够更准确地定位受更新影响的功能，并以更少的步骤完成测试，从而显著提高游戏测试的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: KLPEG框架能够更准确地定位受更新影响的功能，并以更少的步骤完成测试，从而显著提高游戏测试的有效性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid iteration and frequent updates of modern video games pose
significant challenges to the efficiency and specificity of testing. Although
automated playtesting methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise, they often lack structured knowledge accumulation mechanisms, making
it difficult to conduct precise and efficient testing tailored for incremental
game updates. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a KLPEG framework.
The framework constructs and maintains a Knowledge Graph (KG) to systematically
model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling
knowledge accumulation and reuse across versions. Building on this foundation,
the framework utilizes LLMs to parse natural language update logs, identify the
scope of impact through multi-hop reasoning on the KG, enabling the generation
of update-tailored test cases. Experiments in two representative game
environments, Overcooked and Minecraft, demonstrate that KLPEG can more
accurately locate functionalities affected by updates and complete tests in
fewer steps, significantly improving both playtesting effectiveness and
efficiency.

Method: ORCA基准使用Omni的计算器引擎验证输出来评估大型语言模型。

Result: 五个最先进的系统在500个自然语言任务中仅达到45%-63%的准确率，主要错误与四舍五入和计算错误有关。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在数学和工程领域表现出优势，但在物理和自然科学领域表现出劣势。模型之间存在互补性，但并非冗余。

Abstract: We present ORCA (Omni Research on Calculation in AI) Benchmark -- a novel
benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on multi-domain,
real-life quantitative reasoning using verified outputs from Omni's calculator
engine. In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics,
health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5,
Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only
$45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$)
and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate
strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural
sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the
models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make,
highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike
standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical
precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance,
physics, health, and statistics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应屏蔽框架，该框架基于广义反应性等级 1 (GR(1)) 规范，这是一种易于处理且富有表现力的线性时序逻辑 (LTL) 片段，可同时捕获安全性和活跃性属性。


<details>

Motivation: 传统屏蔽方法通常是静态的，因为它们假定固定的逻辑规范和手工制作的抽象。虽然这些静态屏蔽在名义假设下提供安全性，但当环境假设被违反时，它们无法适应。

Method: 该方法在运行时检测环境假设违规，并采用归纳逻辑编程 (ILP) 以系统且可解释的方式自动在线修复 GR(1) 规范。

Result: 在 Minepump 和 Atari Seaquest 两个案例研究中，表明 (i) 当优化辅助奖励时，静态符号控制器通常是次优的，并且 (ii) 配备自适应屏蔽的强化学习 (RL) 代理与静态屏蔽相比，保持了接近最佳的奖励和完美的逻辑合规性。

Conclusion: 该自适应屏蔽框架可以优雅地演变，确保活跃性是可实现的，并且仅在必要时才削弱目标。

Abstract: Shielding is widely used to enforce safety in reinforcement learning (RL),
ensuring that an agent's actions remain compliant with formal specifications.
Classical shielding approaches, however, are often static, in the sense that
they assume fixed logical specifications and hand-crafted abstractions. While
these static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to
adapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the
first adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on
Generalized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and
expressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety
and liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations
at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically
repair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This
ensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and
weakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and
Atari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely
suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped
with our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical
compliance compared with static shields.

Abstract: Training and education in human-centered fields require authentic practice,
yet realistic simulations of human behavior have remained limited. We present a
multi-agent psychological simulation system that models internal
cognitive-affective processes to generate believable human behaviors. In
contrast to black-box neural models, this system is grounded in established
psychological theories (e.g., self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism)
and explicitly simulates an ``inner parliament'' of agents corresponding to key
psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine the
system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment
with human psychology. We describe the system's architecture and theoretical
foundations, illustrate its use in teacher training and research, and discuss
how it embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship,
deliberate practice, and meta-cognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing compositional spatial reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: Procedurally generated dataset with independent variation of compositionality aspects and symbolic solver verification.

Result: LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalization in spatial reasoning but are robust to linguistic variation.

Conclusion: DecompSR enables robust and fine-grained probing of compositional reasoning in LLMs by independently varying key compositionality aspects.

Abstract: We introduce DecompSR, decomposed spatial reasoning, a large benchmark
dataset (over 5m datapoints) and generation framework designed to analyse
compositional spatial reasoning ability. The generation of DecompSR allows
users to independently vary several aspects of compositionality, namely:
productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity and linguistic
variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors) and systematicity
(novel linguistic elements). DecompSR is built procedurally in a manner which
makes it is correct by construction, which is independently verified using a
symbolic solver to guarantee the correctness of the dataset. DecompSR is
comprehensively benchmarked across a host of Large Language Models (LLMs) where
we show that LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalisation in
spatial reasoning tasks whereas they are more robust to linguistic variation.
DecompSR provides a provably correct and rigorous benchmarking dataset with a
novel ability to independently vary the degrees of several key aspects of
compositionality, allowing for robust and fine-grained probing of the
compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent collaboration is important but often fails in practice. This paper proposes a maze-solving benchmark to evaluate collaboration and finds a 'collaboration gap' where strong solo agents perform poorly together. Relay inference can help.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The success of agent-based systems relies on effective collaboration among heterogeneous agents, but few empirical studies have evaluated this at scale.

Method: A collaborative maze-solving benchmark is proposed to evaluate agent collaboration. 32 leading models are tested in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings.

Result: Models that perform well solo often degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Relay inference, where the stronger agent leads, can improve outcomes.

Conclusion: The findings argue for collaboration-aware evaluation, training strategies to enhance collaborative capabilities, and interaction design that elicits agents' latent skills.

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on
agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different
information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will
critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,
even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical
studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a
collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative
capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable
automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving
ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and
closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our
results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often
degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break
down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well
alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting
with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference"
approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,
closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware
evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative
capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent
skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CostBench，一个评估LLM агентов经济推理和重新规划能力的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型（LLM）代理的评估主要强调任务完成，通常忽略资源效率和适应性。这忽略了一个关键能力：代理根据变化的环境设计和调整成本最优计划的能力。

Method: CostBench包含旅行计划领域中的任务，这些任务可以通过具有不同、可定制成本的原子和复合工具的多个序列来解决。它还支持四种类型的动态阻塞事件，例如工具故障和成本变化，以模拟现实世界中的不可预测性，并要求代理实时适应。

Result: 在CostBench上评估领先的开源和专有模型揭示了成本意识规划方面的巨大差距：代理经常无法在静态设置中识别成本最优的解决方案，即使是GPT-5在最困难的任务上的精确匹配率也低于75%，并且在动态条件下性能进一步下降约40%。

Conclusion: 通过诊断这些弱点，CostBench为开发未来经济合理且强大的代理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize
task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This
neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust
cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate
agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the
travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple
sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It
also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and
cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to
adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on
CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently
fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5
achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance
further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these
weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are
both economically rational and robust.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为“span query”的通用接口，旨在优化推理服务器以适应各种非聊天用例，如RAG、推理时扩展和代理工作负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理服务器主要针对聊天完成进行了优化，无法很好地支持新兴的、具有创新性的推理时扩展和深度推理技术。之前的研究表明，如果推理服务器能够适应这些非聊天用例，KV缓存命中率可以显著提高。但是，这些解决方案通常只针对单一用例（如RAG）进行优化。

Method: 该论文提出了span query，它是一种推理调用的表达式树，通过交换性约束连接在一起。论文描述了span query的语法和语义，并展示了如何自动优化它们以提高KV缓存局部性。通过对vLLM进行少量修改（仅影响492行代码），可以实现span query的高性能执行。

Result: 实验结果表明，对于两种不同的非聊天用例，span query可以将TTFT（首个token生成时间）降低10-20倍。此外，span query还可以进行优化以提高注意力局部性，从而避免所谓的“中间丢失”问题。在一个20亿参数的模型上使用注意力优化的span query，其准确性大大超过了使用80亿参数模型的标准推理服务器。

Conclusion: Span query是一种通用的接口，可以有效地支持各种非聊天用例，并显著提高推理性能和准确性。

Abstract: Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of
innovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same
time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior
work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if
inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer
solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we
introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.
We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads
can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that
had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter
-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper
introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked
together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and
semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache
locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can
enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we
demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two
distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be
optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called
lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span
query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock
inference server using an 8b model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用LLM半自动生成控制工程领域知识表示的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 控制工程领域的研究产出快速增长，需要新的方法来构建和形式化领域知识。

Method: 利用LLM将自然语言描述和LaTeX数学定义转换为形式化的知识图谱，基于PyIRK框架。

Result: 生成了一个“交互式语义层”，以增强源文档，促进知识转移。

Conclusion: 有助于为控制工程领域构建易于访问、协作和可验证的知识库。

Abstract: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering calls for new
approaches to structure and formalize domain knowledge. This paper briefly
describes an LLM-supported method for semi-automated generation of formal
knowledge representations that combine human readability with machine
interpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative
Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language
models can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and
mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized
knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an
``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to
facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the
vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for
the control engineering domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的诊断性故障模式，即模态破坏，其中高置信度的单模态错误会覆盖其他证据并误导融合结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 中的推理过程，特别是确定哪种模态驱动预测、冲突如何解决以及何时一个流占主导地位。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级的、模型无关的评估层，该评估层将每个模态视为一个代理，生成候选标签和用于审计的简要自我评估。一个简单的融合机制聚合这些输出，从而暴露贡献者（支持正确结果的模态）和破坏者（误导的模态）。

Result: 在对具有基础模型的多模态情感识别基准进行案例研究中，应用我们的诊断层揭示了系统的可靠性配置文件，从而深入了解了故障是可能源于数据集伪影还是模型限制。

Conclusion: 我们的框架为多模态推理提供了一个诊断支架，支持对融合动态进行有原则的审计，并为可能的干预提供信息。

Abstract: Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their
reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a
prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this
paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a
high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused
result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic
evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate
labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism
aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct
outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic
layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with
foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight
into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations.
More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal
reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing
possible interventions.

TL;DR: Orion-MSP是一种用于表格数据的上下文学习架构，它通过多尺度处理、块稀疏注意力以及Perceiver风格的记忆来克服现有架构的局限性，并在各种基准测试中达到或超过了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表格数据神经网络模型在处理异构特征类型和复杂交互方面存在挑战。当前的表格上下文学习架构存在单尺度特征处理、密集注意力和严格顺序组件处理的局限性。

Method: 提出Orion-MSP架构，包含三个关键创新：多尺度处理、块稀疏注意力和Perceiver风格的记忆。

Result: Orion-MSP在各种基准测试中与最先进的性能相匹配或超过，并在高维表格中有效地扩展。

Conclusion: Orion-MSP为高效的表格上下文学习建立了一个新的标准。

Abstract: Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet,
developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to
heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple
scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN
and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to
gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,
current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature
processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with
quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component
processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and
cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce
Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)
multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)
block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for
scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style
memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across
diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance
while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new
standard for efficient tabular in-context learning. The model is publicly
available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-MSP .

TL;DR: 提出了一个优化AI攻击策略的框架，以更好地评估AI风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂的Agent环境中，评估AI控制的风险越来越重要，但由于计算限制，难以获得足够的攻击策略数据。

Method: 将攻击能力分解为五个组成部分，并分别优化每个部分。利用概率模型模拟攻击动态，并使用该模拟优化攻击超参数。

Result: 攻击强度显著提高，安全评分从0.87降至0.41。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升攻击强度，为AI风险评估提供更可靠的依据。

Abstract: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, it becomes
increasingly important to be able to estimate their risk. AI control is one
framework for doing so. However, good control evaluations require eliciting
strong attack policies. This can be challenging in complex agentic environments
where compute constraints leave us data-poor. In this work, we show how to
optimize attack policies in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse realistic control
environments. We do this by decomposing attack capability into five constituent
skills -- suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution and
subtlety -- and optimizing each component individually. To get around the
constraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack
dynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then
show that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial
improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87
to 0.41 using our scaffold.

TL;DR: Kosmos is an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery by running cycles of data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior AI agents for scientific research are limited in the number of actions they can take before losing coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings.

Method: Kosmos uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis agent and a literature search agent, enabling it to coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts.

Result: 79.4% of statements in Kosmos reports were found to be accurate. A single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of research. Kosmos made seven discoveries, with three reproducing existing findings and four making novel contributions.

Conclusion: Kosmos can automate data-driven discovery and generate valuable scientific findings.

Abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature
search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been
made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such
agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing
coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,
an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended
objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of
parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before
synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos
uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis
agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to
coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively
executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.
Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,
ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of
statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a
single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own
research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number
of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles
(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that
span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.
Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or
unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four
make novel contributions to the scientific literature.

Motivation: 当前人工智能科学发现缺乏语义，无法提升我们对世界的理解。

Method: 使用神经符号框架中的逻辑，为深度学习提供语义。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑语义和神经网络的连接，概述了神经编码和知识提取方法，并讨论了在实践中识别语义编码的困难。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful new language of science as
evidenced by recent Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics that recognized
contributions to AI applied to those areas. Yet, this new language lacks
semantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With
the purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the
world, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of
translating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we
argue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a
neurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the
neural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic
AI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are
satisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction
approaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a
framework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural
networks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various
existing approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how
logical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we
review some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for
neural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our
framework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic
encoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.

TL;DR: Agent-Omni框架通过主代理系统协调现有基础模型，实现灵活的多模态推理，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)能力很强，但仍然局限于固定的模态对，并且需要使用大型对齐数据集进行昂贵的微调。构建能够整合文本、图像、音频和视频的完全全能模型仍然是不切实际的，并且缺乏强大的推理支持。

Method: 我们提出了一个Agent-Omni框架，该框架通过一个主代理系统协调现有的基础模型，实现灵活的多模态推理，而无需重新训练。主代理解释用户意图，将子任务委托给特定于模态的代理，并将它们的输出集成到连贯的响应中。

Result: 在文本、图像、音频、视频和全能基准上的大量实验表明，Agent-Omni始终达到最先进的性能，特别是在需要复杂跨模态推理的任务上。

Conclusion: 其基于代理的设计能够无缝集成专门的基础模型，确保适应不同的输入，同时保持透明性和可解释性。此外，该框架是模块化的，易于扩展，允许在更强大的模型可用时进行未来的改进。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but
remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with
large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate
text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning
support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates
existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible
multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user
intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their
outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,
audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex
cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of
specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while
maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is
modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models
become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support
continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.

Motivation: 过程挖掘的有效性，特别是与机器学习或深度学习结合使用时，取决于拥有大型事件日志。事件日志增强技术通过生成额外的轨迹来模拟真实的流程执行来解决这个限制。

Method: 本文评估了七种最先进的增强技术在八个事件日志中的效果，并与基于随机转换系统的基线技术进行了比较。比较分析了四个不同的方面：相似性、预测信息的保存、信息丢失/增强以及所需的计算时间。

Result: 结果表明，考虑到不同的标准，一种基于随机转换系统结合资源队列建模的技术将提供更高质量的合成事件日志。事件日志增强技术也与传统的数据增强技术进行了比较，表明前者提供了显著的好处，而后者未能考虑过程约束。

Conclusion: 本文对七种事件日志增强技术进行了全面的比较，结果表明基于随机转换系统结合资源队列建模的技术可以提供更高质量的合成事件日志，并且事件日志增强技术优于传统的数据增强技术。

Abstract: Process mining analyzes and improves processes by examining transactional
data stored in event logs, which record sequences of events with timestamps.
However, the effectiveness of process mining, especially when combined with
machine or deep learning, depends on having large event logs. Event log
augmentation addresses this limitation by generating additional traces that
simulate realistic process executions while considering various perspectives
like time, control-flow, workflow, resources, and domain-specific attributes.
Although prior research has explored event-log augmentation techniques, there
has been no comprehensive comparison of their effectiveness. This paper reports
on an evaluation of seven state-of-the-art augmentation techniques across eight
event logs. The results are also compared with those obtained by a baseline
technique based on a stochastic transition system. The comparison has been
carried on analyzing four different aspects: similarity, preservation of
predictive information, information loss/enhancement, and computational times
required. Results show that, considering the different criteria, a technique
based on a stochastic transition system combined with resource queue modeling
would provide higher quality synthetic event logs. Event-log augmentation
techniques are also compared with traditional data-augmentation techniques,
showing that the former provide significant benefits, whereas the latter fail
to consider process constraints.

Abstract: Defect phase diagrams provide a unified description of crystal defect states
for materials design and are central to the scientific objectives of the
Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 1394. Their construction requires the
systematic integration of heterogeneous experimental and simulation data across
research groups and locations. In this setting, research data management (RDM)
is a key enabler of new scientific insight by linking distributed research
activities and making complex data reproducible and reusable.
  To address the challenge of heterogeneous data sources and formats, a
comprehensive RDM infrastructure has been established that links experiment,
data, and analysis in a seamless workflow. The system combines: (1) a joint
electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system,
(2) easy-to-use large-object data storage, (3) automatic metadata extraction
from heterogeneous and proprietary file formats, (4) interactive provenance
graphs for data exploration and reuse, and (5) automated reporting and analysis
workflows. The two key technological elements are the openBIS electronic
laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, and a newly
developed companion application that extends openBIS with large-scale data
handling, automated metadata capture, and federated access to distributed
research data.
  This integrated approach reduces friction in data capture and curation,
enabling traceable and reusable datasets that accelerate the construction of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPARQL查询语义网络数据具有挑战性，特别是对于非专业用户，因为该语言的复杂语法和理解复杂数据结构的先决条件。

Method: InteracSPARQL集成了LLM与基于规则的方法，首先直接从SPARQL抽象语法树（AST）生成结构化解释，然后进行基于LLM的语言细化。用户可以通过直接反馈或LLM驱动的自我完善来交互地完善查询，从而能够实时纠正模糊或不正确的查询组件。

Result: 在标准基准上评估InteracSPARQL，与基线方法相比，在查询准确性、解释清晰度和整体用户满意度方面表现出显着改进。

Conclusion: 结合基于规则的方法与LLM驱动的改进，以创建更易于访问和更强大的SPARQL界面是有效的。

Abstract: In recent years, querying semantic web data using SPARQL has remained
challenging, especially for non-expert users, due to the language's complex
syntax and the prerequisite of understanding intricate data structures. To
address these challenges, we propose InteracSPARQL, an interactive SPARQL query
generation and refinement system that leverages natural language explanations
(NLEs) to enhance user comprehension and facilitate iterative query refinement.
InteracSPARQL integrates LLMs with a rule-based approach to first produce
structured explanations directly from SPARQL abstract syntax trees (ASTs),
followed by LLM-based linguistic refinements. Users can interactively refine
queries through direct feedback or LLM-driven self-refinement, enabling the
correction of ambiguous or incorrect query components in real time. We evaluate
InteracSPARQL on standard benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in
query accuracy, explanation clarity, and overall user satisfaction compared to
baseline approaches. Our experiments further highlight the effectiveness of
combining rule-based methods with LLM-driven refinements to create more
accessible and robust SPARQL interfaces.

Motivation: 现有ML服务平台使用批处理来优化高吞吐量，但会暴露于不可预测的尾部延迟。Vortex旨在解决这个问题。

Method: Vortex的流水线实现了SLO-first的方法。

Result: Vortex的流水线在各种工作负载下，比TorchServe和Ray Serve实现了显著更低和更稳定的延迟，通常能以两倍以上的请求速率实现给定的SLO目标。当RDMA可用时，Vortex的优势更加显著。

Conclusion: Vortex能够以服务水平延迟目标（SLO）为先的方法，显著降低和稳定机器学习推理和服务的延迟。

Abstract: There is growing interest in deploying ML inference and knowledge retrieval
as services that could support both interactive queries by end users and more
demanding request flows that arise from AIs integrated into a end-user
applications and deployed as agents. Our central premise is that these latter
cases will bring service level latency objectives (SLOs). Existing ML serving
platforms use batching to optimize for high throughput, exposing them to
unpredictable tail latencies. Vortex enables an SLO-first approach. For
identical tasks, Vortex's pipelines achieve significantly lower and more stable
latencies than TorchServe and Ray Serve over a wide range of workloads, often
enabling a given SLO target at more than twice the request rate. When RDMA is
available, the Vortex advantage is even more significant.

Motivation: 组合关系的动机源于在数据仓库模型中设计和实现多值维度和桥表的挑战。

Method: 该方法基于组合数字系统，通过一个数字表示一个集合的 n 个元素的 k 个组合的所有可能表示。

Result: 组合关系不以单独的表物理存储，所有信息都封装到添加到 G 的单个列中。新列是 G 中的候选键。

Conclusion: 提出了名为 Rank-Join 的附加操作，以组合与组合关系集相关的 g 和 i 中的信息。

Abstract: In this paper we propose an approach to implement specific relation-ship set
between two entities called combinatorial relationship set. For the
combinatorial relationship set B between entity sets G and I the mapping
cardinality is many-to-many. Additionally, entities from G can be uniquely
encoded with a pair of values (h, k) generated with the procedure for numbering
combinations of entities from I. The encoding procedure is based on
combinatorial number system that provides a representation of all possible k
-combinations of a set of n elements by a single number. In general
many-to-many relationship sets are represented by a relation or table, while
the combinatorial relationship is not physically stored as separate table.
However, all information is encapsulated into a single column added to G. The
new column is a candidate key in G. Additional operation named Rank-Join to
fundamental relational-algebra is presented to combine information from g and i
associated with a combinatorial relationship set. Motivation for combinatorial
relationship originates from challenges in designing and implementing
multivalued dimensions and bridge tables in data-warehouse models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图相似度搜索算法，该算法在过滤步骤中使用整数线性规划公式定义的下界，并在验证步骤中利用阈值参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图编辑距离（GED）是衡量两个图之间相似性的重要指标。然而，精确计算GED的复杂性很高，因此需要图相似度搜索来确定两个图之间的编辑距离是否低于给定的阈值。

Method: 该方法定义了一个基于整数线性规划公式的下界，并提出了一种使用下界算法层次结构的图相似度搜索算法。

Result: 在广泛的测试中，该方法在大多数阈值上明显优于最先进的算法。

Conclusion: 该方法在图相似度搜索方面具有显著的优势。

Abstract: The Graph Edit Distance (GED) is an important metric for measuring the
similarity between two (labeled) graphs. It is defined as the minimum cost
required to convert one graph into another through a series of (elementary)
edit operations. Its effectiveness in assessing the similarity of large graphs
is limited by the complexity of its exact calculation, which is NP-hard
theoretically and computationally challenging in practice. The latter can be
mitigated by switching to the Graph Similarity Search under GED constraints,
which determines whether the edit distance between two graphs is below a given
threshold. A popular framework for solving Graph Similarity Search under GED
constraints in a graph database for a query graph is the
filter-and-verification framework. Filtering discards unpromising graphs, while
the verification step certifies the similarity between the filtered graphs and
the query graph. To improve the filtering step, we define a lower bound based
on an integer linear programming formulation. We prove that this lower bound
dominates the effective branch match-based lower bound and can also be computed
efficiently. Consequently, we propose a graph similarity search algorithm that
uses a hierarchy of lower bound algorithms and solves a novel integer
programming formulation that exploits the threshold parameter. An extensive
computational experience on a well-assessed test bed shows that our approach
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm on most of the
examined thresholds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complexity of data preparation and query processing shifts to data discovery tasks like Table Union Search (TUS).

Method: Three modular steps: Table Serialization, Table Representation using LLMs for embeddings, and Vector Search with approximate nearest neighbor indexing.

Result: EasyTUS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with improvements up to 34.3% in MAP, 79.2x speedup in data preparation, and 7.7x faster query processing. Strong performance even in metadata-absent settings.

Conclusion: EasyTUS is robust and adaptable across data lakes, with TUSBench enabling unified comparisons.

Abstract: Data lakes enable easy maintenance of heterogeneous data in its native form.
While this flexibility can accelerate data ingestion, it shifts the complexity
of data preparation and query processing to data discovery tasks. One such task
is Table Union Search (TUS), which identifies tables that can be unioned with a
given input table. In this work, we present EasyTUS, a comprehensive framework
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform efficient and scalable
Table Union Search across data lakes. EasyTUS implements the search pipeline as
three modular steps: Table Serialization for consistent formatting and
sampling, Table Representation that utilizes LLMs to generate embeddings, and
Vector Search that leverages approximate nearest neighbor indexing for semantic
matching. To enable reproducible and systematic evaluation, in this paper, we
also introduce TUSBench, a novel standardized benchmarking environment within
the EasyTUS framework. TUSBench supports unified comparisons across approaches
and data lakes, promoting transparency and progress in the field. Our
experiments using TUSBench show that EasyTUS consistently outperforms most of
the state-of the-art approaches, achieving improvements in average of up to
34.3% in Mean Average Precision (MAP), up to 79.2x speedup in data preparation,
and up to 7.7x faster query processing performance. Furthermore, EasyTUS
maintains strong performance even in metadata-absent settings, highlighting its
robustness and adaptability across data lakes.

### [123] [Relational Deep Dive: Error-Aware Queries Over Unstructured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02711)
*Daren Chao,Kaiwen Chen,Naiqing Guan,Nick Koudas*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ReDD框架通过动态发现查询特定的模式、填充关系表和确保具有可证明保证的错误感知提取，解决了非结构化数据分析查询的挑战。它使用迭代模式发现（ISD）和表格数据填充（TDP）的两阶段流程，并结合了用于错误检测的统计校准方法SCAPE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如RAG）缺乏模式意识，并且难以进行跨文档对齐，从而导致高错误率。ReDD旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ReDD框架包含两个阶段：(1) 迭代模式发现 (ISD)，用于识别针对每个查询量身定制的最小的可连接模式；(2) 表格数据填充 (TDP)，它使用在LLM隐藏状态上训练的轻量级分类器来提取和纠正数据。此外，还使用了SCAPE和SCAPE-HYB方法进行错误检测。

Result: 实验表明，ReDD能够将数据提取错误率从高达30%降低到1%以下，同时保持高模式完整性（100%召回率）和精确度。

Conclusion: ReDD的模块化设计能够对准确性-成本权衡进行细粒度控制，使其成为非结构化语料库上高风险分析查询的强大解决方案。

Abstract: Unstructured data is pervasive, but analytical queries demand structured
representations, creating a significant extraction challenge. Existing methods
like RAG lack schema awareness and struggle with cross-document alignment,
leading to high error rates. We propose ReDD (Relational Deep Dive), a
framework that dynamically discovers query-specific schemas, populates
relational tables, and ensures error-aware extraction with provable guarantees.
ReDD features a two-stage pipeline: (1) Iterative Schema Discovery (ISD)
identifies minimal, joinable schemas tailored to each query, and (2) Tabular
Data Population (TDP) extracts and corrects data using lightweight classifiers
trained on LLM hidden states. A main contribution of ReDD is SCAPE, a
statistically calibrated method for error detection with coverage guarantees,
and SCAPE-HYB, a hybrid approach that optimizes the trade-off between accuracy
and human correction costs. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate
ReDD's effectiveness, reducing data extraction errors from up to 30% to below
1% while maintaining high schema completeness (100% recall) and precision.
ReDD's modular design enables fine-grained control over accuracy-cost
trade-offs, making it a robust solution for high-stakes analytical queries over
unstructured corpora.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态推荐方法依赖于粗糙的视觉特征和不受控制的融合，导致冗余或错位的表示，视觉编码器通常无法捕获显著的、与项目相关的语义。

Result: 在三个Amazon数据集上的实验表明，VLIF始终优于最新的多模态基线，并大大加强了视觉特征的贡献。

Conclusion: VLIF框架有效地提高了多模态推荐的性能，并加强了视觉特征的贡献。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal recommendation (MMR) have shown that
incorporating rich content sources such as images and text can lead to
significant gains representation quality. However, existing methods often rely
on coarse visual features and uncontrolled fusion, leading to redundant or
misaligned representations. As a result, visual encoders often fail to capture
salient, item-relevant semantics, limiting their contribution in multimodal
fusion. From an information-theoretic perspective, effective fusion should
balance the unique, shared, and redundant information across modalities,
preserving complementary cues while avoiding correlation bias. This paper
presents VLIF, a vision-language and information-theoretic fusion framework
that enhances multimodal recommendation through two key components. (i) A
VLM-based visual enrichment module generates fine-grained, title-guided
descriptions to transform product images into semantically aligned
representations. (ii) An information-aware fusion module, inspired by Partial
Information Decomposition (PID), disentangles redundant and synergistic signals
across modalities for controlled integration. Experiments on three Amazon
datasets demonstrate that VLIF consistently outperforms recent multimodal
baselines and substantially strengthens the contribution of visual features.

*Yuhan Wang,Qing Xie,Zhifeng Bao,Mengzi Tang,Lin Li,Yongjian Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: KGBridge: a knowledge-guided prompt learning framework for cross-domain sequential recommendation under non-overlapping user scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG-based methods still face major challenges in cross-domain recommendation (CDR), particularly under non-overlapping user scenarios, including sensitivity to KG sparsity and popularity bias, dependence on overlapping users for domain alignment and lack of explicit disentanglement between transferable and domain-specific knowledge, which limit effective and stable knowledge transfer.

Method: KGBridge comprises two core components: a KG-enhanced Prompt Encoder, which models relation-level semantics as soft prompts to provide structured and dynamic priors for user sequence modeling, and a Two-stage Training Paradigm, which combines cross-domain pretraining and privacy-preserving fine-tuning to enable knowledge transfer without user overlap. By combining relation-aware semantic control with correspondence-driven disentanglement, KGBridge explicitly separates and balances domain-shared and domain-specific semantics, thereby maintaining complementarity and stabilizing adaptation during fine-tuning

Result: KGBridge consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and remains robust under varying KG sparsity, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating structural imbalance and semantic entanglement in KG-enhanced cross-domain recommendation.

Conclusion: KGBridge is effective in mitigating structural imbalance and semantic entanglement in KG-enhanced cross-domain recommendation.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs), as structured knowledge bases that organize
relational information across diverse domains, provide a unified semantic
foundation for cross-domain recommendation (CDR). By integrating symbolic
knowledge with user-item interactions, KGs enrich semantic representations,
support reasoning, and enhance model interpretability. Despite this potential,
existing KG-based methods still face major challenges in CDR, particularly
under non-overlapping user scenarios. These challenges arise from: (C1)
sensitivity to KG sparsity and popularity bias, (C2) dependence on overlapping
users for domain alignment and (C3) lack of explicit disentanglement between
transferable and domain-specific knowledge, which limit effective and stable
knowledge transfer. To this end, we propose KGBridge, a knowledge-guided prompt
learning framework for cross-domain sequential recommendation under
non-overlapping user scenarios. KGBridge comprises two core components: a
KG-enhanced Prompt Encoder, which models relation-level semantics as soft
prompts to provide structured and dynamic priors for user sequence modeling
(addressing C1), and a Two-stage Training Paradigm, which combines cross-domain
pretraining and privacy-preserving fine-tuning to enable knowledge transfer
without user overlap (addressing C2). By combining relation-aware semantic
control with correspondence-driven disentanglement, KGBridge explicitly
separates and balances domain-shared and domain-specific semantics, thereby
maintaining complementarity and stabilizing adaptation during fine-tuning
(addressing C3). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
KGBridge consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and remains robust
under varying KG sparsity, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating
structural imbalance and semantic entanglement in KG-enhanced cross-domain
recommendation.

Motivation: 评估排序质量需要可靠的评估指标。MAP@k被广泛使用，因为它考虑了项目的相关性和它们在列表中的位置。

Method: 推导了AP@k的期望和方差，涵盖了离线和在线两种广泛使用的评估模型。

Result: AP@k的期望建立了基线，表明了纯粹偶然性可以达到的MAP@k水平。方差通过量化随机波动的程度来补充这个基线，从而能够更可靠地解释观察到的分数。

Conclusion: AP@k的期望和方差可以作为MAP@k的基线，用于更可靠地解释观察到的分数。

Abstract: Recommender systems and information retrieval platforms rely on ranking
algorithms to present the most relevant items to users, thereby improving
engagement and satisfaction. Assessing the quality of these rankings requires
reliable evaluation metrics. Among them, Mean Average Precision at cutoff k
(MAP@k) is widely used, as it accounts for both the relevance of items and
their positions in the list.
  In this paper, the expectation and variance of Average Precision at k (AP@k)
are derived since they can be used as biselines for MAP@k. Here, we covered two
widely used evaluation models: offline and online. The expectation establishes
the baseline, indicating the level of MAP@k that can be achieved by pure
chance. The variance complements this baseline by quantifying the extent of
random fluctuations, enabling a more reliable interpretation of observed
scores.

*Zijian Zhang,Rong Wang,Shiyang Li,Yuebo Luo,Mingyi Hong,Caiwen Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CudaForge是一个用于CUDA内核生成和优化的免训练多代理工作流程，它利用LLM自动生成、纠正和优化CUDA内核，并整合硬件反馈，从而实现了高效率和广泛的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计CUDA内核成本高且耗时，因此需要自动化的方法，但现有方法效率低、计算开销大且泛化能力差。

Method: CudaForge采用两个LLM代理：Coder和Judge，它们迭代地生成、纠正和优化CUDA内核，同时整合硬件反馈（如Nsight Compute指标）。

Result: CudaForge生成的内核正确率达到97.6%，并且比PyTorch基线平均加速1.68倍，显著超过了现有模型。此外，CudaForge在不同GPU和基础模型上表现出强大的泛化能力，生成优化内核的成本也远低于现有方案。

Conclusion: 多代理、免训练的工作流程可以实现高性价比、通用且高性能的CUDA内核优化。

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI
applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is
both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage
LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,
however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational
overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose
CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and
optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human
experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing
correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More
specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that
iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating
hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive
evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,
achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$
speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,
CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,
3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,
QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an
optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$
0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that
costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that
multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by
integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment
analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high
computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt
enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on
the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and

Method: 使用特征值熵作为评估指标。

Result: 证明了该方法优于现有标准方法。

Conclusion: 特征值熵可以作为二元或多类问题的有效评估指标，并能估计混淆矩阵以应对不平衡类问题。

Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical
applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition,
pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage
processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are
often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method
quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical
value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation
measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with
imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an
evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem,
relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures,
the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver
characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is
an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced
classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the
proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the
literature.

Abstract: Traditional methods for high-dimensional diffeomorphic mapping often struggle
with the curse of dimensionality. We propose a mesh-free learning framework
designed for $n$-dimensional mapping problems, seamlessly combining variational
principles with quasi-conformal theory. Our approach ensures accurate,
bijective mappings by regulating conformality distortion and volume distortion,
enabling robust control over deformation quality. The framework is inherently
compatible with gradient-based optimization and neural network architectures,
making it highly flexible and scalable to higher-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with classical
optimization techniques like AdamW to improve convergence and generalization.
However, the mechanisms by which quantum-inspired methods enhance classical
training remain underexplored. We introduce Superpositional Gradient Descent
(SGD), a novel optimizer linking gradient updates with quantum superposition by
injecting quantum circuit perturbations. We present a mathematical framework
and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. On
synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD
converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising
results, scalability and hardware constraints limit adoption. Overall, this
work provides new insights into the intersection of quantum computing and deep
learning, suggesting practical pathways for leveraging quantum principles to

Motivation: 现有的基于学习的解算子难以推广到未见过的源或边界函数。

Method: 从代表问题域的体积点云中提取每个点的特征，并使用它们来预测解算子的分解，然后通过数值积分评估解。

Result: 在 MCB 数据集的机械零件几何形状的稳态热分析中，Neural Green's Function 优于最先进的神经算子，在五个形状类别中实现了 13.9% 的平均误差降低，并且比需要计算成本高昂的网格划分的数值求解器快 350 倍。

Conclusion: Neural Green's Function 具有强大的泛化能力，且效率更高。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear
partial differential equations (PDEs) whose differential operators admit
eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of
linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural
Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization
across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions.
Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a
volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict
a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to
evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based
solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or
boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific
functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization.
In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB
dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators,
achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\% across five shape categories,
while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires
computationally expensive meshing.

*Yeqiu Chen,Ziyan Liu,Hong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合框架DeepContour，它集成了基于深度学习的谱预测器和核密度估计，用于原理轮廓设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模广义特征值问题（GEP）在科学和工程中是一项根本但计算量过大的任务。轮廓积分（CI）方法（如CIRR算法）提供了一个高效且可并行化的框架。然而，它们的性能严重依赖于积分轮廓的选择——在没有可靠的特征值分布先验知识的情况下不正确的选择会导致大量的计算开销并损害数值精度。

Method: DeepContour首先采用傅里叶神经算子（FNO）来快速预测给定GEP的频谱分布。随后，将核密度估计（KDE）应用于预测的频谱，以自动和系统地确定适当的积分轮廓。最后，这些优化的轮廓引导CI求解器有效地找到所需的特征值。

Result: DeepContour加速了多个数据集上的GEP求解，实现了高达5.63倍的加速。

Conclusion: 通过将深度学习的预测能力与经典求解器的数值严谨性相结合，这项工作为解决涉及高维矩阵的困难广义特征值问题开创了一种高效而稳健的范例。

Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental
yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising
direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an
efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is
critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper
selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur
significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To
address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that
integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density
Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first
employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral
distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine
proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI
solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our
main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,
achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of
deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers
an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue
involving matrices of high dimension.

Motivation: 现实世界轨迹数据面临隐私、成本和质量等挑战；现有方法忽略了人口分布对轨迹生成的影响。

Method: 构建空间图以增强轨迹的空间相关性；设计动态人口分布感知去噪网络以捕获人类移动行为的时空依赖性以及人口分布在去噪过程中的影响。

Result: 在一些关键统计指标方面，我们模型生成的轨迹可以类似于真实世界的轨迹，比最先进的算法高出 54% 以上。

Conclusion: 该模型能够生成与真实轨迹相似的轨迹，并在性能上优于现有算法。

Abstract: Human trajectory data is crucial in urban planning, traffic engineering, and
public health. However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces
challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality.
A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method
developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation
methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often
overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In
reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density
across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior.
Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion
model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to
guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial
graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a
dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of
population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show
that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world
trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming
state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

Result: 实验结果表明，FineXL 可以提高 56% 的可解释性准确率。

Conclusion: FineXL 能够提升个性化图像生成模型的可解释性，尤其是在不同个性化场景下对多种图像生成模型进行个性化时。

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种纯强化学习方法 Tool-Zero，用于训练工具增强型 LLM，以提高其在复杂任务中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前监督微调范式依赖于构建领域特定的数据集来训练模型，但这种方法通常难以有效地推广到不熟悉或复杂的工具使用场景。强化学习 (RL) 范式可以赋予 LLM 卓越的推理和泛化能力。

Method: 本文提出了一种动态泛化引导的奖励设计，用于基于规则的强化学习，该设计逐步将奖励从探索性工具使用模式转移到利用性工具使用模式。基于此设计，本文引入了 Tool-Zero 系列模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，与相同实验设置下的 SFT 和 RL-with-SFT 模型相比，本文的模型实现了超过 7% 的性能提升。这些收益在跨数据集和数据集内评估中得到一致的重复，验证了本文方法的有效性和稳健性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的 Tool-Zero 模型能够有效地利用通用工具，并通过直接扩展 RL from Zero 模型（即没有后训练的基础模型）来实现。

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised
fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets
to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize
effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and
generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure
RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and
enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic
generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively
shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on
this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained
to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL
from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental
results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement
compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental
settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于机器学习的系统模型，以提高定性研究中样本量确定的客观性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统定性研究中样本量的确定依赖于主观且模糊的数据饱和原则，这可能导致不一致并威胁方法论的严谨性。

Method: 该研究利用来自五种基本定性研究方法的数据集，开发了一种集成学习模型。使用序数尺度评估了十个关键参数，并将其用作输入特征。经过彻底的预处理和异常值去除后，训练并比较了多种 ML 算法。

Result: K-最近邻 (KNN)、梯度提升 (GB)、随机森林 (RF)、XGBoost 和决策树 (DT) 算法显示出最高的解释力（测试 R2 ~ 0.85），有效地模拟了定性抽样决策中涉及的复杂非线性关系。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个基于网络的计算应用程序的概念框架，旨在为定性研究人员、期刊审稿人和论文导师提供决策支持系统。

Abstract: The determination of sample size in qualitative research has traditionally
relied on the subjective and often ambiguous principle of data saturation,
which can lead to inconsistencies and threaten methodological rigor. This study
introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this
process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental
qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,
Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an
ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,
information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal
scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier
removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and
Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~
0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in
qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital
roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative
validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study
concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational
application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative
researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a
significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing
transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative
inquiry through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过保留适度简单的训练问题，可以在不增加输出长度的情况下，提高大型语言模型在难题上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的可验证奖励强化学习（RLVR）管道会滤除“简单”问题，导致模型将“思考更长”等同于“思考更好”，从而过度冗长并增加推理成本。

Method: 保留并适度增加简单问题的权重，作为一种隐式的长度正则化方法。

Result: 在 Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 上，实现了基线 pass@1 AIME25 准确率，同时生成解决方案的平均长度缩短了近一半。

Conclusion: 通过让模型接触可解的短链任务，约束了其输出分布并防止了过度冗长，从而实现了“免费的突发简洁性”。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become
excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for
training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems
that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution
upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with
``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly
up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer.
Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output
distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is
\textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder
problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of
any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on
\textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline
pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly
twice as short. The code is available at

### [140] [The Geometry of Grokking: Norm Minimization on the Zero-Loss Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01938)
*Tiberiu Musat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grokking是指神经网络中在完全记住训练数据后，经过一段延迟才出现的完全泛化现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究将这种延迟泛化与权重衰减驱动的表征学习联系起来，但其精确的潜在动态仍然难以捉摸。本文认为，可以通过约束优化的角度来理解记忆后的学习：梯度下降有效地最小化零损失流形上的权重范数。

Method: 在无穷小学习率和权重衰减系数的限制下，对该现象进行了正式证明。为了进一步剖析这种机制，引入了一种近似方法，将参数子集的学习动态与网络的其余部分分离。应用这个框架，导出了一个两层网络中第一层记忆后动态的闭式表达式。

Result: 实验证实，使用预测梯度模拟训练过程可以重现grokking的延迟泛化和表征学习特征。

Conclusion: 通过约束优化的角度理解记忆后的学习，梯度下降有效地最小化零损失流形上的权重范数。

Abstract: Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full
generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete
memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed
generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the
precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that
post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained
optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the
zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally
small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this
regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a
subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we
derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first
layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training
process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed
generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

*Guillaume Tejedor,Veronika Peralta,Nicolas Labroche,Patrick Marcel,Hélène Blasco,Hugo Alarcan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的ALS患者聚类方法，该方法使用疾病进展声明评分对序列进行分组。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALS是一种严重的疾病，目前的治疗方法只能延长有限的寿命，患者反应的变异性凸显了个性化护理的需求。然而，研究受到小型、异质队列、稀疏纵向数据以及缺乏对临床上有意义的患者群体的明确定义的阻碍。

Method: 提出了一种聚类方法，该方法通过多个描述性变量整合医学专业知识，研究了几种结合这些变量的距离度量，既重用现成的距离，又采用弱监督学习方法。将这些距离与聚类方法配对，并以最先进的技术为基准。

Result: 在图尔大学医院353名ALS患者的数据集上评估表明，该方法在生存分析中优于最先进的方法，同时获得了可比较的轮廓系数。

Conclusion: 所学习的距离提高了医学专家对结果的相关性和可解释性。

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical
survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only
limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the
need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,
heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear
definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering
methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a
clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression
declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple
descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such
variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a
weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering
methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation
of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital
of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition,
the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for
medical experts.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种通用的COFs吸附预测框架(COFAP)，通过深度学习提取多模态结构和化学特征，并通过交叉模态注意力机制融合这些互补特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机器学习预测器严重依赖于特定的气体相关特征，这些特征耗时且限制了可扩展性，导致效率低下和劳动密集型过程。

Method: 该方法通过深度学习提取多模态结构和化学特征，并通过交叉模态注意力机制融合这些互补特征。

Result: COFAP在hypoCOFs数据集上优于以前的方法，创造了新的SOTA，并且发现用于分离的高性能COFs集中在窄范围的孔径和表面积内。

Conclusion: COFAP具有卓越的效率和准确性，可以直接部署在晶体多孔材料中。

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas
adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their
vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional
machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features.
However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to
inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption
prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal
structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these
complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry
coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming
previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that
high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore
size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also
developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs
for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly
deployable in crystalline porous materials.

TL;DR: 本研究利用心脏病健康指标数据集，开发了一种策略性加权集成模型，该模型结合了基于树的方法（LightGBM、XGBoost）和卷积神经网络（CNN）来预测CVD风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病（CVD）仍然是一个关键的全球健康问题，需要可靠和可解释的预测模型来进行早期风险评估。

Method: 该模型在229,781名患者的预处理数据集上进行训练，通过策略性加权来管理固有的类别不平衡，并通过特征工程将原始的22个特征增强到25个。该模型结合了基于树的方法（LightGBM、XGBoost）和卷积神经网络（CNN）。为了提供透明性和临床可解释性，使用了替代决策树和SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP)。

Result: 最终的集成模型比最佳个体模型实现了统计上显著的改进，测试AUC为0.8371 (p=0.003)，特别适合于筛查，召回率为80.0%。

Conclusion: 该模型通过混合不同的学习架构，并通过SHAP和替代决策树结合了解释性，从而实现了稳健的预测性能和临床透明度的结合，使其成为在公共卫生筛查中进行实际部署的有力候选者。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern,
demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk
assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease
Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model
that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a
preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was
managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the
original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically
significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of
0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of
80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate
decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed
model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical
transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating
explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong
candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的架构原则，输出条件门控，通过基于模型自身过去推论调整其内部记忆门来实现自反思，从而增强记忆保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准循环神经网络（包括 LSTM）难以建模远程依赖关系，尤其是在包含噪声或误导信息的序列中。

Method: 将输出条件门控原则与注意力机制相结合，提出了 EchoLSTM 模型。

Result: 在 Distractor Signal Task 上，EchoLSTM 的准确率达到 69.0%，比标准 LSTM 基线高出 33 个百分点。在 ListOps 基准测试中，EchoLSTM 的性能与现代 Transformer 模型相当，参数效率提高了 5 倍以上。Trigger Sensitivity Test 提供了定性证据，表明该模型的自反思机制可以带来更强大的内存系统。

Conclusion: 输出条件门控和自反思机制能够显著提高模型在处理长程依赖和噪声数据时的性能。

Abstract: Standard Recurrent Neural Networks, including LSTMs, struggle to model
long-range dependencies, particularly in sequences containing noisy or
misleading information. We propose a new architectural principle,
Output-Conditioned Gating, which enables a model to perform self-reflection by
modulating its internal memory gates based on its own past inferences. This
creates a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances memory retention. Our final
model, the EchoLSTM, integrates this principle with an attention mechanism. We
evaluate the EchoLSTM on a series of challenging benchmarks. On a
custom-designed Distractor Signal Task, the EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy,
decisively outperforming a standard LSTM baseline by 33 percentage points.
Furthermore, on the standard ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM achieves
performance competitive with a modern Transformer model, 69.8% vs. 71.8%, while
being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. A final Trigger Sensitivity Test
provides qualitative evidence that our model's self-reflective mechanism leads
to a fundamentally more robust memory system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroClean是一个用于脑电图(EEG)和局部场电位(LFP)数据的无监督预处理方法，旨在减少伪影和噪声，提高数据质量和机器学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑电图(EEG)和局部场电位(LFP)数据容易受到伪影和噪声的影响，需要自动化的预处理方法。

Method: NeuroClean是一个五步流程，包括带通滤波、线路噪声滤波、坏通道拒绝、独立成分分析和基于聚类算法的自动成分拒绝。该流程使用机器学习分类器来确保在清洗过程的每一步之后保留任务相关的信息。

Result: NeuroClean可以有效去除信号中的多种常见伪影。在运动任务中，清洗后的数据在多项式逻辑回归模型中达到了超过97%的准确率，而原始数据的准确率为74%。

Conclusion: NeuroClean是一个有前景的流程，可以应用于未来的工作和研究，以在机器学习流程中实现更好的泛化和性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely
used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are
used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications.
However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise
sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is
proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As
a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP
preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness
and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to
mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The
pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and
line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an
efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection
based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to
ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the
cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline.
NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover,
in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97%
accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic
Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which
performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising
pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve
better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从随机梯度下降公式出发，展示了拉格朗日函数可以被重组为一个数据独立的体项和一个数据相关的边界项。

Method: 将拉格朗日函数重组为一个数据独立的体项和一个数据相关的边界项。体项捕获由网络架构和激活函数设置的内在动力学，而边界反映来自输入和输出层训练样本的随机交互。

Result: 这种分解暴露了深度网络底层的局部和同质结构。

Conclusion: 基于这种分解，我们开发了一种基于场论的神经动力学公式。

Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for
understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the
stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be
reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary
term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and
activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from
training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the
local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural
extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on
this decomposition.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TapOut的在线、免训练、即插即用的动态推测策略选择算法，该算法使用多臂老虎机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定最佳的tokens数量来起草仍然是限制该方法有效性的一个关键挑战。现有的方法通常依赖于手动调整的敏感阈值(例如，tokens熵)，这些阈值的设置成本很高，并且在模型和领域之间的泛化能力较差。

Method: 使用多臂老虎机，采用了一种元算法，该算法基于过去的奖励和探索，在多个无参数动态推测策略中进行选择。

Result: TapOut在不同的模型对和数据集上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明，与已建立的动态推测基线相比，TapOut实现了有竞争力的或更优越的加速，而不需要任何超参数调优。

Conclusion: TapOut算法在动态推测策略选择方面表现出色，无需手动调整超参数，且在不同模型和数据集上具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to
generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a
larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft
remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic
speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to
achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive
thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly
across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free,
plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using
multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among
multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and
exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and
datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups
compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究涌现性错位(EM)的根本机制，这种机制使得有害行为能够在不同的领域中进行泛化。

Method: 采用几何视角研究EM，并证明它在不同的数据集中表现出一种基本的跨任务线性结构。

Result: EM参数在不同任务中表现出很强的收敛性，微调的权重更新显示出相对较高的余弦相似度，以及由它们的主角和投影重叠测量的共享的低维子空间。

Conclusion: EM的产生是由于不同的狭窄任务发现了同一组共享的参数方向，这表明有害行为可能被组织成权重空间中特定的、可预测的区域。

Abstract: Recent work has discovered that large language models can develop broadly
misaligned behaviors after being fine-tuned on narrowly harmful datasets, a
phenomenon known as emergent misalignment (EM). However, the fundamental
mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain
poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM
and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in
how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we
find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned
weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared
lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and
projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via
linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow
misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results
indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of
shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized
into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this
fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we
hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability
and weight-based interventions.

Motivation: 神经网络在训练新任务时会忘记以前学习的任务，这是一个根本问题。

Method: 该框架结合了神经正切核（NTK）理论、威尔逊置信区间的统计验证以及使用多种指标评估路径质量。

Result: 在Split-CIFAR10上，平均准确率为66.7%，灾难性遗忘率为23.4%，与基线相比有了很大的改进，并且取得了接近最新技术水平的有竞争力的性能。NTK条件数是学习能力限制的预测指标，表明存在条件数 >10^{11} 的临界阈值。随着任务序列的进行，所提出的策略显示出降低遗忘的趋势（27% 到 18%），这是一种系统稳定。该框架使用严格的统计保证验证了 80% 的发现路径，并在中间任务上保持 90-97% 的保留率。

Conclusion: 确定了持续学习环境的核心容量限制，并提供了增强自适应正则化的可行见解。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual
learning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when
trained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated
framework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson
confidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple
metrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost
of 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the
baseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to
state-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers
are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of
a critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note
that the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the
sequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The
framework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical
guarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core
capacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the
analysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are
offered.

locally owned by decentralized clients who have their own definitions for the
quality of representability. This setting requires repetitive aggregation of
local information computed by the clients. While the main motivation is to
respect the privacy and autonomy of the clients, the federated setting is
vulnerable to client misbehaviors: malicious clients might share fake
information. An analogy is backdoor attack in conventional federated learning,
but our challenge differs freshly due to the unique characteristics of
submodular maximization. We propose RobustFSM, a federated submodular
maximization solution that is robust to various practical client attacks. Its
performance is substantiated with an empirical evaluation study using
real-world datasets. Numerical results show that the solution quality of
RobustFSM substantially exceeds that of the conventional federated algorithm
when attacks are severe. The degree of this improvement depends on the dataset
and attack scenarios, which can be as high as 200%

### [151] [Predicting Microbial Interactions Using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02038)
*Elham Gholamzadeh,Kajal Singla,Nico Scherf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究使用单培养生长能力、与其他物种的相互作用和系统发育数据来预测物种间相互作用的积极或消极影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测物种间相互作用是微生物生态学中的一个关键挑战，因为这些相互作用对于确定微生物群落的结构和活动至关重要。

Method: 我们利用最大的成对相互作用数据集之一来训练我们的模型，该数据集包含在 40 种不同的碳条件下共同培养的来自两个分类组的 20 个物种之间的 7,500 多个相互作用。我们建议使用图神经网络 (GNN) 作为强大的分类器来预测效应的方向。我们构建成对微生物相互作用的边缘图，以便利用各个共培养实验中共享的信息，并使用 GNN 来预测相互作用模式。

Result: 我们的初始结果令人鼓舞，F1 分数为 80.44%。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅可以预测二元相互作用（正/负），还可以对更复杂的相互作用类型进行分类，例如互惠主义、竞争和寄生。该模型明显优于文献中类似的方法，包括传统的极限梯度提升 (XGBoost) 模型，后者的 F1 分数为 72.76%。

Abstract: Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology,
as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of
microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth
capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a
negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the
largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising
over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups
co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the
work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We
construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage
shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to
predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary
interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction
types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were
encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms
comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.

*M. Z. Haider,M. U. Ghouri,Tayyaba Noreen,M. Salman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了量子增强生成模型（QEGM），用于解决罕见事件建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度生成模型难以捕捉罕见事件，存在模式崩溃或不确定性估计不准确的问题。

Method: QEGM集成了深度隐变量模型和变分量子电路，引入混合损失函数和量子随机噪声注入。

Result: 在金融、气候和蛋白质结构等数据集上，QEGM将尾部KL散度降低了高达50%，同时提高了罕见事件的召回率和覆盖率校准。

Conclusion: QEGM为罕见事件预测提供了一种有效方法，其鲁棒性超越了纯粹的经典方法。

Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological
anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and
heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to
capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or
producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the
Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework
that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.
The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that
jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)
quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and
mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical
parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are
optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic
Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and
protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by
up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),
while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings
highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event
prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical
methods.

TL;DR: Flashlight是一个PyTorch框架，它可以自动生成融合的、FlashAttention风格的内核，用于任意基于注意力的程序，而无需依赖静态模板或预定义的内核专业化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型中的注意力机制变体繁多，但有效支持这些变体仍然很困难，因为它们通常需要专门的内核或手动调整的实现。

Method: Flashlight利用PyTorch的编译工作流程来透明地融合和分割注意力计算，从而为不同的注意力模式实现高效执行。

Result: Flashlight生成的内核具有与FlexAttention竞争或更优越的性能，同时提供原生PyTorch代码的灵活性。

Conclusion: Flashlight使开发人员能够快速探索新的注意力模型，而不会牺牲性能。

Abstract: Bad charactors when submitting to arXiv: Attention is a fundamental building
block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to
implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and
kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of
attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency.
Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require
specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently
addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support
FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within
the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style
kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static
templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's
compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently,
enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it
support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles
more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the
capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or
superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native
PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models
without sacrificing performance.

TL;DR: 在微调LLM用于分类时，给每个标签附加简短的解释可以产生更好的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在微调过程中，给每个标签附加简短解释是否能产生更好的模型。

Method: 使用来自多个LLM的集成生成数据，微调一个70亿参数的模型，并在六个不同的对话数据集上进行测试。通过三个轴评估对话响应质量：自然性、全面性和主题一致性，每个轴都以5点量表进行评分。

Result: 在18个数据集和任务设置中，标签加解释的训练优于仅标签的基线。即使使用随机token替换人工编写的解释，也能提高准确性。

Conclusion: 解释增强的微调，无论是使用真正的理由还是精心构建的随机token序列，都可以提高LLM分类的准确性和可靠性，同时阐明token级脚手架如何在推理过程中塑造计算。

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels.
We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning
yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three
axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on
5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune
a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.
Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms
label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace
human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet
vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words
variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve
accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true
explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,
indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra
token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a
regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit
higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive
mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before
decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine
rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy
and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level
scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多流注意力的深度学习框架，该框架既可以用作传感器优化器，又可以用作自动数据审计员。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用可穿戴传感器和AI的客观步态分析对于管理神经和骨科疾病至关重要。然而，模型容易受到隐藏的数据集偏差的影响，并且特定任务的传感器优化仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 该模型使用多流注意力机制，可以定量地发现严重的数据集混淆。

Result: 该模型在OA和CVA筛查任务中，将超过70％的注意力分配给右脚，而忽略了左脚。这不是临床发现，而是直接反映了公共数据集中严重的偏侧性偏差。

Conclusion: 这项工作的主要贡献是方法论上的，证明了一个可解释的框架可以自动审计数据集的完整性。作为次要发现，该模型提出了新的、数据驱动的传感器协同作用（例如，头部加脚部用于PD筛查），作为未来优化方案的假设。

Abstract: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for
managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable
to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a
challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework
that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor.
Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical
tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention
mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA
screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model
assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically
ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI
[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe
laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.
The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an
interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a
secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for
example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized
protocols.

TL;DR: 开发一个求解器，用于最大化二元变量的实值函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 求解器依赖于一种算法，该算法估计来自目标及其各自子实例的基础分布的实例的最佳目标函数值。

Method: 估计器的训练基于一种不等式，该不等式有助于使用与最优条件相关的预期总偏差作为损失函数，而不是目标函数本身。

Result: 它不计算策略值，也不依赖于已解决的实例。

Conclusion: 开发了一个求解器，用于最大化二元变量的实值函数，该求解器依赖于一种算法，该算法估计来自目标及其各自子实例的基础分布的实例的最佳目标函数值。

Abstract: The paper is about developing a solver for maximizing a real-valued function
of binary variables. The solver relies on an algorithm that estimates the
optimal objective-function value of instances from the underlying distribution
of objectives and their respective sub-instances. The training of the estimator
is based on an inequality that facilitates the use of the expected total
deviation from optimality conditions as a loss function rather than the
objective-function itself. Thus, it does not calculate values of policies, nor
does it rely on solved instances.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了对比一致性搜索 (CCS)，旨在阐明其机制并扩展其适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCS 是一种无监督探测方法，能够测试大型语言模型是否在其内部激活中表示二元特征，例如句子真值。虽然 CCS 已显示出前景，但其两项目标仅被部分理解。

Method: 我们将 CCS 重新 формулировка 为一个特征值问题，从而产生具有可解释的特征值和自然扩展到多个变量的封闭式解决方案。

Result: 我们在一系列数据集上评估了这些方法，发现它们恢复了与 CCS 相似的性能，同时避免了围绕对随机初始化的敏感性的问题。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，相对化对比一致性不仅提高了我们对 CCS 的理解，而且为更广泛的探测和机械可解释性方法开辟了道路。

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to
test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence
truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term
objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with
the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue
that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building
on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form
solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple
variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding
that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around
sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing
contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens
pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

Motivation: 现有的MDLMs解码速度慢，且置信度存在波动，缺乏动态调整。

Method: 通过在单个序列上校准阈值，并将其应用于后续输入。

Result: 在GPQA, GSM8K, 和 HumanEval数据集上，OSDT实现了更好的精度-吞吐量权衡。

Conclusion: 可重复使用的任务级置信度特征为diffusion解码中的算法和系统创新提供了机会。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are becoming competitive with their
autoregressive counterparts but typically decode with fixed steps and
sequential unmasking. To accelerate decoding, recent work such as Fast-dLLM
enables parallel decoding via a static global confidence threshold, yet we
observe strong block- and step-wise confidence fluctuations and, within a
dataset, near-identical confidence trajectories across inputs as measured by
cosine similarity. Motivated by these observations, we introduce One-Shot
Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT), which calibrates thresholds on a single sequence
and applies them to subsequent inputs with negligible overhead. On GPQA, GSM8K,
and HumanEval, OSDT attains superior accuracy-throughput trade-offs (+24%
tokens/s on GSM8K at the best accuracy, +45% on GPQA with comparable accuracy,
and +50% on HumanEval with a modest accuracy gap). Beyond these results, our
findings suggest broader opportunities to leverage reusable task-level
confidence signatures for more general-purpose algorithmic and systems
innovations in diffusion decoding.

Motivation: 在科学领域，有效利用系统物理学的先验知识对于机器学习的应用至关重要。以前的方法主要集中在架构层面上结合物理见解。

Method: 推导能量损失函数，假设每个数据样本都与近似能量景观保持热平衡。通过使用与数据周围的玻尔兹曼分布的反向KL散度，我们将损失获得为数据和模型预测之间的能量差。

Result: 在分子生成和自旋基态预测方面，与基线相比，报告了显着改进。

Conclusion: 我们的公式产生了具有物理意义的损失函数，其梯度与有效配置更好地对齐，同时与架构无关且计算效率高。能量损失函数本质上也尊重物理对称性。

Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for
applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches
mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level.
In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly
into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems
like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each
data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy
landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution
around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data
and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives
like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In
contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with
gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being
architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions
also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on
molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant
improvements over baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于构建世界模型的框架，该框架基于离散和连续随机过程的基本构建块，并允许组合这些构建块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界建模领域是分散的，研究人员开发的定制架构很少相互构建。

Method: 该方法指定了结构化世界模型的自然构建块，基于任何世界模型必须捕获的基本随机过程：离散过程（逻辑、符号）和连续过程（物理、动力学）；然后通过这些构建块的层次组合来定义世界模型。考察了隐马尔可夫模型 (HMM) 和切换线性动态系统 (sLDS) 作为离散和连续建模的自然构建块——当用动作增强时，它们变成了部分可观察的马尔可夫决策过程 (POMDP) 和受控 sLDS。

Result: 通过多模态生成建模（被动）和像素规划（主动）来回顾实际的表现力，其性能与神经方法相比具有竞争力，同时保持了可解释性。

Conclusion: 核心的突出挑战是可扩展的联合结构-参数学习；目前的解决方法是通过巧妙地逐步增加结构和参数来解决这个问题，但其可扩展性有限。如果解决了这些问题，这些自然构建块可以为世界建模提供基础架构，类似于标准化层如何促进深度学习的进步。

Abstract: The field of world modeling is fragmented, with researchers developing
bespoke architectures that rarely build upon each other. We propose a framework
that specifies the natural building blocks for structured world models based on
the fundamental stochastic processes that any world model must capture:
discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics,
dynamics); the world model is then defined by the hierarchical composition of
these building blocks. We examine Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching
linear dynamical systems (sLDS) as natural building blocks for discrete and
continuous modeling--which become partially-observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) and controlled sLDS when augmented with actions. This
modular approach supports both passive modeling (generation, forecasting) and
active control (planning, decision-making) within the same architecture. We
avoid the combinatorial explosion of traditional structure learning by largely
fixing the causal architecture and searching over only four depth parameters.
We review practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling
(passive) and planning from pixels (active), with performance competitive to
neural approaches while maintaining interpretability. The core outstanding
challenge is scalable joint structure-parameter learning; current methods
finesse this by cleverly growing structure and parameters incrementally, but
are limited in their scalability. If solved, these natural building blocks
could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to how
standardized layers enabled progress in deep learning.

Result: 在线学习对于保持ML模型性能至关重要，与静态模型相比，误差降低了80%。在线集成和所提出的不确定性引导的在线集成分别比基于标准单模型的在线学习减少了约6%和10%的预测误差。

Conclusion: 不确定性引导的在线集成方法可以有效提高聚变装置中TF线圈偏转的预测精度。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and
operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary
behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and
machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to
maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.
Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has
been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an
application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream
for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion
facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain
ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.
Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance
degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As
such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further
improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)
technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the
uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces
predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of
historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the
predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed
uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and
10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.

Motivation: Shapley 数据估值在数据集管理、修剪和定价方面很有用，但由于其组合性质，计算成本很高。

Method: 提出了一种基于统计杠杆分数的几何替代方案，该方案量化了每个数据点在表示空间中的结构影响。

Conclusion: 杠杆抽样可以生成参数和预测风险在全数据最优值 O(ε) 范围内的模型，从而在数据估值和下游决策质量之间建立联系。

Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for
assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in
dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure
that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,
making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric
alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each
datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how
much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective
dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the
dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending
them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains
that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We
further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose
parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data
optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and
downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment
in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms
standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解地理 INRs 中包含多少信息，以及这些信息集中在哪里。

Method: 分析了环境维度在 256 到 512 之间的 INRs 的内在维度。

Result: 发现其内在维度大致在 2 到 10 之间，并且对空间分辨率和 INR 预训练期间的输入模态的变化敏感。地理 INR 的内在维度与下游任务性能相关，并且可以捕获空间伪影。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种与架构无关、无标签的信息内容度量标准，可以实现跨 INRs 的无监督评估、模型选择和预训练设计。

Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation,
geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional
location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through
models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the
common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact,
learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much
information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that
information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the
number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability,
regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This
work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic
INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that
their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to
changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training.
Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR
correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts,
facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an
architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable
unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的回归任务中，均方误差（MSE）损失是一个常见的选择，但对于非高斯或重尾噪声，它可能不可靠。为了解决这个问题，我们采用了一种基于非参数回归的鲁棒损失，它使用基于核的残差密度估计，并最大化估计的对数似然。

Method: 通过分析虚假局部最小值的限制等距属性（RIP）常数的上限，我们进一步研究了这种鲁棒损失如何重塑优化前景。

Result: 通过理论和实证分析，我们表明这种新的损失在处理大噪声方面表现出色，并在不同的噪声分布中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过简单地改变损失，为增强机器学习任务的鲁棒性提供了初步的见解，并由一个直观且广泛适用的分析框架指导。

Abstract: In this paper we study how the choice of loss functions of non-convex
optimization problems affects their robustness and optimization landscape,
through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks,
mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for
non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust
loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of
the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust
formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains
stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss
reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted
isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels
at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.
This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine
learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and

Motivation: 现有的方差依赖 regret bound 的研究主要集中在基于 UCB 的 bandit 算法上，而对 Thompson 采样算法的研究较少，且现有算法存在局限性。

Method: 本文通过扩展 decoupling coefficient 技术，提出了一种 variance-aware 的 Thompson 采样算法 FGTSVA。

Result: FGTSVA 算法实现了 $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$ 的 regret bound，在上下文线性 bandits 设置下，与基于 UCB 的算法的 regret bound 相匹配。

Conclusion: 本文提出的 FGTSVA 算法在上下文 bandit 问题上取得了最优的 regret bound，并在上下文线性 bandits 设置下与 UCB 算法的性能相当。

Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent
studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on
upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based
bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only
exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to
linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the
model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson
Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with
optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the
decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good
Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With
the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the
regret of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$,
where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number
of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g.,
variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual
linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms
using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).

Method: 该方法通过小波特征提取和自适应阈值压缩方法，将一维心音图（PCG）信号转换为紧凑的二维图像。我们将心音模式压缩成一个8像素的图像，因此量子阶段只需要8个量子比特。

Result: 在HLS-CMDS数据集上的初步结果表明，在测试集上的分类准确率为93.33%，在训练集上的分类准确率为97.14%，这表明量子模型可以有效地捕获生物医学信号中的时间-光谱相关性。

Conclusion: 我们所知，这是QCNN算法在生物声信号处理中的首次应用。所提出的方法代表了针对资源受限的医疗保健环境的量子增强诊断系统的早期步骤。

Abstract: Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the
timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid
quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3
and murmur abnormalities in heart sound signals. The approach transforms
one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional
images through a combination of wavelet feature extraction and adaptive
threshold compression methods. We compress the cardiac-sound patterns into an
8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage.
Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification
accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum
models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm
for bioacoustic signal processing. The proposed method represents an early step
toward quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems for resource-constrained healthcare
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often operate as black-box predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug characteristics and results.

Method: CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and independence.

Result: CausalDDS outperforms baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings, and effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug synergy.

Conclusion: CausalDDS is a practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

Abstract: Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective
combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing
methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box
predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug
characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,
a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious
substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting
drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively
mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious
substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In
addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where
interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a
novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and
independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.
Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug
synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the
molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a
practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

Result: 论文展示了使用特征函数作为频域方法在高维空间中测量分布偏移和领域自适应方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 特征函数是量化分布偏移的有效替代方法。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used in various applications due
to their significant advantages over traditional learning methods. However, the
developed ML models often underperform when deployed in the real world due to
the well-known distribution shift problem. This problem can lead to a
catastrophic outcomes when these decision-making systems have to operate in
high-risk applications. Many researchers have previously studied this problem
in ML, known as distribution shift problem, using statistical techniques (such
as Kullback-Leibler, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Wasserstein distance, etc.) to
quantify the distribution shift. In this letter, we show that using
Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach is a powerful
alternative for measuring the distribution shift in high-dimensional space and
for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Time series data is one of the most popular data modalities in critical
domains such as industry and medicine. The demand for algorithms that not only
exhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such
fields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper,
we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of
multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the
ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique
challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and
handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified
convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an
autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We
evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA
archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as
non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation
studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among
ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with
non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable
results accessible to domain experts.

Motivation: 现实中，由于收集和传输问题，观测数据经常缺失，影响可靠的推断和风险评估，并可能导致过度自信的外推。

Method: 使用傅里叶特征和图注意力编码器来捕获多尺度空间依赖性和季节性时间动态。通道门控学习单元自适应地过滤和放大信息特征。贝叶斯推理联合优化预测分布和参数不确定性。

Conclusion: 该研究为新兴传感范例中基于深度学习的、具有不完整观测的时空预测奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure
assessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often
missing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission
issues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and
risk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these
challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit
based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features
with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and
seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with
learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and
amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive
distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and
calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real
world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing
against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction
accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate
robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of
extraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep
learning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in
emerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管之前的基准测试侧重于加法和乘法，但减法作为一种非交换运算，受到的关注相对较少。研究表明，LLM在减法运算上存在结构性问题。

Method: 研究评估了四个系列、八个预训练的LLM在加法和减法问题上的表现。通过探测分析，研究人员探究了LLM内部对结果是否应该为负数的编码情况。此外，还测试了少样本学习和指令调整等技术。

Result: 实验表明，LLM的减法准确率明显低于加法。当a<b时，LLM经常产生正确的数值，但忽略负号。少样本提示略有改善，而指令调整后的模型在生成负号方面达到了接近完美的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究结果清晰地描述了LLM在减法运算能力上的局限性和可恢复性，并表明指令调整可以有效提升LLM的减法性能。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).
While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has
received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as
a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four
families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that
subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the
errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs
frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing
analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,
yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further
test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to
see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while
few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve
near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these
findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and
recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

TL;DR: OmniField: A continuity-aware framework for multimodal spatiotemporal learning that addresses data sparsity, irregularity, noise, and varying modality availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal spatiotemporal data is sparse, irregular, noisy, and has varying modality availability, which limits the usable data record.

Method: OmniField learns a continuous neural field conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context using a multimodal crosstalk block architecture.

Result: OmniField outperforms eight strong baselines and is robust to sensor noise.

Conclusion: OmniField enables unified reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without gridding or surrogate preprocessing.

Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is
constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse,
irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of
available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record
unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose
OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field
conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.
A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal
refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified
reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without
gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField
consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.
Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input
levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 选择特定学生任务组合的最佳教师模型需要昂贵的试错。

Method: GRACE测量学生梯度的分布特性，无需访问验证器、教师logits、教师内部或测试数据。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH上，GRACE与蒸馏的LLaMA和OLMo学生的表现密切相关（高达86%的Spearman相关性）。使用GRACE选择的教师模型训练学生可以比简单地使用表现最佳的教师模型提高高达7.4%的性能。

Conclusion: GRACE可以有效识别给定学生的强兼容教师，并为如何执行蒸馏提供细粒度的指导。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an efficient strategy to use data generated by
large "teacher" language models to train smaller capable "student" models, but
selecting the optimal teacher for a specific student-task combination requires
expensive trial-and-error. We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to
quantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.
GRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without
access to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an
information-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of
gradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the
distilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%
Spearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo
students. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher
can improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the
best-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design
choices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when
generating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size
constraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively
identify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide
fine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解对象及其交互的智能体可以学习更鲁棒和可转移的策略。然而，大多数以对象为中心的 RL 方法通过单个对象来分解状态，而将交互保持在隐式状态。

Method: FIOC-WM 首先学习以对象为中心的潜在变量和直接从像素学习交互结构，利用预训练的视觉编码器。然后，学习到的世界模型将任务分解为可组合的交互原语，并在其上训练分层策略：高层选择交互的类型和顺序，而低层执行它们。

Result: 在模拟机器人和具身人工智能基准测试中，FIOC-WM 提高了策略学习样本效率和对世界模型基线的泛化，表明显式的模块化交互学习对于鲁棒控制至关重要。

Conclusion: 显式的模块化交互学习对于鲁棒控制至关重要。

Abstract: Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that
are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods
factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We
introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a
unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and
their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics
with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving
sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM
first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from
pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then
decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical
policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of
interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and
embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and
generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular
interaction learning is crucial for robust control.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态token-to-expert重路由框架，旨在降低MoE模型的解码延迟，同时保持模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在自回归生成过程中，由于专家负载增长缓慢，容易进入内存限制状态，导致解码延迟受激活专家数量影响。

Method: 通过动态重路由token-to-expert映射来减少激活的专家数量。最佳结果通过批量感知路由实现，允许token搭载已加载到内存中的专家。

Result: 在Qwen3-30B和Qwen3-235B模型上，批量大小为16时，在没有显著精度损失的情况下，MoE层解码延迟分别降低了39%和15%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不影响模型质量的前提下，有效降低MoE模型的解码延迟。

Abstract: An increasing number of LLMs employ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
where the feed-forward layer is replaced by a pool of experts and each token
only activates a small subset of them. During autoregressive generation, these
models often enter a memory-bound regime even for moderate batch sizes because
the average expert load grows more slowly than in an equivalent dense
feedforward layer. Consequently, MoE latency is governed by the number of
activated experts. We introduce a framework for dynamically re-routing
token-to-expert mapping to lower this number (and thus, the decode latency)
while preserving a comparable quality. Our best results use a batch-aware
routing that works by having tokens piggyback experts that have already been
loaded into memory due to being crucial to other tokens within the same batch.
Empirically, we evaluate our method on the Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with
a batch size of $16$. Without any statistically significant loss in accuracy,
our approach achieves latency reductions of $39\%$ and $15\%$ in the MoE layer
decode latency, respectively.

Motivation: 神经网络参数的初始化对学习性能有重要影响，好的初始化可以避免反向传播的额外训练。神经网络倾向于在较早的层学习粗略的信息，即频谱偏置。本文旨在研究在神经网络初始化中利用频谱偏置信息的效果。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的框架，该框架调整SWIM算法中的比例因子，以在早期隐藏层中捕获低频分量，并在后期隐藏层中表示高频分量。

Result: 在一维回归任务和MNIST分类任务上的数值实验表明，该方法优于传统的初始化算法。

Conclusion: 这项工作阐明了学习神经网络中内在光谱特性的重要性，该发现产生了一种有效的参数初始化策略，可增强其训练性能。

Abstract: Initialization of neural network parameters, such as weights and biases, has
a crucial impact on learning performance; if chosen well, we can even avoid the
need for additional training with backpropagation. For example, algorithms
based on the ridgelet transform or the SWIM (sampling where it matters) concept
have been proposed for initialization. On the other hand, it is well-known that
neural networks tend to learn coarse information in the earlier layers. The
feature is called spectral bias. In this work, we investigate the effects of
utilizing information on the spectral bias in the initialization of neural
networks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the
SWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden
layers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden
layers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the
MNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
conventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of
intrinsic spectral properties in learning neural networks, and the finding
yields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their
training performance.

Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization,
and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning.
Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated
optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online
learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth
functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz)
functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For
(strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding
gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates
between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our
algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter,
exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch
conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal
universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness.
However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more
challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a
detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a
universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth
regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.

  across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging when the
governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end,
various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate
state transition
  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed
training
  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth
state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
method that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian
ffltering methods, enabling
  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics
directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.
Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation
of surrogate model parameters
  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a
discretetime
  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate
transition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which
can be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the
model is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage
using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework
accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and
partially observed measurement
  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

TL;DR: 提出联邦量子核学习（FQKL）框架，用于在异构物联网网络中实现分布式、保护隐私的异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网 (IIoT) 系统的快速增长为高维多元时间序列中的异常检测带来了新的挑战，其中隐私、可扩展性和通信效率至关重要。经典联邦学习方法通过实现去中心化训练来缓解隐私问题，但它们通常难以应对高度非线性决策边界和不平衡的异常分布。

Method: 量子边缘节点使用参数化量子电路本地计算压缩的内核统计信息，并且仅与中央服务器共享这些摘要，中央服务器构造全局 Gram 矩阵并训练决策函数 (例如，Fed-QSVM)。

Result: 在合成 IIoT 基准测试中的实验结果表明，与经典联邦基线相比，FQKL 在捕获复杂的时间相关性方面实现了卓越的泛化，同时显着降低了通信开销。

Conclusion: 这项工作突出了量子内核在联邦环境中的前景，从而为下一代物联网基础设施的可扩展、稳健和量子增强智能开辟了道路。

Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created
new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate
time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are
critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by
enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear
decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap,
we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates
quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed,
privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our
design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using
parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central
server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function
(e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate
that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal
correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly
reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum
kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and
quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.

### [181] [FP8-Flow-MoE: A Casting-Free FP8 Recipe without Double Quantization Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02302)
*Fengjuan Wang,Zhiyi Su,Xingzhu Hu,Cheng Wang,Mou Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为FP8-Flow-MoE的FP8训练方法，用于解决大型混合专家模型（MoE）的训练计算和内存需求问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低精度训练方法依赖于BF16主导的数据流，频繁的量化-反量化转换抵消了FP8的效率。直接使用FP8会引入双重量化误差，降低数值稳定性。

Method: 该方法采用量化一致的FP8中心数据流，具有scaling-aware transpose和融合的FP8算子，减少了显式类型转换操作。

Result: 在671B参数MoE模型上的评估表明，与BF16和原始FP8基线相比，吞吐量提高了21%，每个GPU的内存使用量降低了16.5 GB，同时保持了稳定的收敛。

Conclusion: FP8-Flow-MoE是一种有效的FP8训练方法，可以提高MoE模型的训练效率并降低内存占用。

Abstract: Training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models remains computationally
prohibitive due to their extreme compute and memory demands. Although
low-precision training promises to accelerate computation and reduce memory
footprint, existing implementations still rely on BF16-dominated dataflows with
frequent quantize-dequantize (Q/DQ) conversions. These redundant casts erode
much of FP8's theoretical efficiency. However, naively removing these casts by
keeping dataflows entirely in FP8 introduces double quantization error: tensors
quantized along different dimensions accumulate inconsistent scaling factors,
degrading numerical stability.
  We propose FP8-Flow-MoE, an FP8 training recipe featuring a
quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with a scaling-aware transpose and
fused FP8 operators that streamline computation and eliminate explicit cast
operations from 12 to 2. Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model demonstrate
up to 21\% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to
BF16 and na\"ive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence. We
provide a plug-and-play FP8 recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and
Megatron-LM, which will be open-sourced soon.

*Aman Sharma,Paras Chopra*

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言模型推理的测试时间缩放问题，对比了并行和串行两种方式，发现串行方式在大多数情况下优于并行方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在相同 token 预算和计算资源下，并行运行多个独立链还是运行少量链进行迭代优化更好。

Method: 通过在 5 个最先进的开源模型和 3 个具有挑战性的推理基准上进行综合评估，比较并行自洽性范式和串行缩放的性能。引入逆熵加权投票方法，以进一步提高串行缩放的准确性。

Result: 串行缩放始终优于并行自洽性范式，在 95.6% 的配置中，准确率提升高达 46.7%。逆熵加权投票进一步提高了串行缩放的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，串行优化是现代 LLM 推理的稳健默认选择，需要转变我们在推理时优化方法上的范式。

Abstract: We revisit test-time scaling for language model reasoning and ask a
fundamental question: at equal token budget and compute, is it better to run
multiple independent chains in parallel, or to run fewer chains that
iteratively refine through sequential steps? Through comprehensive evaluation
across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning
benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon
previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel
self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy
upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel
training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By
weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning
chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as
the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge
the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since
Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning
sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and
necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的多智能体强化学习 (MARL) 框架，用于 IMCT 中 45 个 TPP 的并行调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头颈癌 (HNC) 计划很困难，因为多个危及器官 (OAR) 靠近复杂的目标。调强碳离子治疗 (IMCT) 具有卓越的剂量适形性和 OAR 保护能力，但由于相对生物有效性 (RBE) 建模，速度仍然很慢，导致费力、基于经验且通常次优的许多治疗计划参数 (TPP) 的调整。最近的深度学习 (DL) 方法受到数据偏差和计划可行性的限制，而强化学习 (RL) 难以有效地探索指数级大的 TPP 搜索空间。

Method: 使用集中式训练分散式执行 (CTDE) QMIX 主干，结合 Double DQN、Dueling DQN 和循环编码 (DRQN)，以便在高维非平稳环境中进行稳定学习。为了提高效率，(1) 使用紧凑的历史 DVH 向量作为状态输入，(2) 应用线性动作到值转换，将小的离散动作映射到均匀的参数调整，以及 (3) 设计一个绝对的、临床知情的分段奖励，与计划分数对齐。同步多进程工作系统与 PHOENIX TPS 接口，用于并行优化和加速数据收集。

Result: 在一个头颈部数据集（10 个训练，10 个测试）上，该方法同时调整了 45 个参数，并产生了与专家手动计划相当或更好的计划（相对计划分数：RL $85.93\\pm7.85\%$ vs 手动 $85.02\\pm6.92\%$），五个 OAR 的显着改善（p 值 < 0.05）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过直接 TPS 交互有效地探索了高维 TPP 空间，并生成了具有临床竞争力的 IMCT 计划，显着改善了 OAR 保护。

Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical
organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated
carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but
remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading
to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many
treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are
limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)
struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We
propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45
TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)
QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for
stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance
efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)
apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to
uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed
piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker
system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and
accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10
testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans
comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL
$85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05)
improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional
TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS
interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.

TL;DR: RoME是一个用于预测跨领域MILP解决方案的领域鲁棒混合专家框架，通过学习任务嵌入将问题实例动态路由到专门的专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的方法在加速MILP求解器方面显示出巨大的前景，但大多数现有方法是在单领域设置中开发和评估的，限制了它们推广到看不见的问题分布的能力。这个限制对构建可扩展的通用学习求解器构成了主要的障碍。

Method: 我们引入了一个领域鲁棒的混合专家框架RoME，用于预测跨领域的MILP解决方案。RoME基于学习的任务嵌入将问题实例动态地路由到专门的专家。该模型使用两级分布鲁棒优化策略进行训练：领域间缓解跨领域的全局转移，领域内通过引入任务嵌入的扰动来增强局部鲁棒性。

Result: 在一个包含三个领域的数据集上训练的单个RoME模型，在五个不同的领域上评估时，平均提高了67.7%。

Conclusion: 在MIPLIB上对预训练模型进行了零样本测试，证明了它能够在具有挑战性的现实世界实例上提供可衡量的性能提升，而现有的基于学习的方法通常难以推广。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful
framework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains.
Recently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP
solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches
are developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability
to generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major
obstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To
address this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts
framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes
problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The
model is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization
strategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and
intra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task
embeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's
generalization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance
within each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general
intrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on
three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five
diverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot
setting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on
challenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often
struggle to generalize.

TL;DR: HYSTL: 使用超网络学习城市犯罪预测器，无需假设不同城市记录中存在相同的犯罪类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有犯罪预测方法难以协调不同城市之间的知识，因为这些城市在特定犯罪类型的数据可用性方面差异很大。

Method: 设计一个超网络，根据感兴趣的犯罪类型动态生成预测函数的参数。构建结构化的犯罪知识图谱，其中犯罪的学习表征被用作超网络的输入，以促进参数生成。

Result: 在两个具有非重叠犯罪类型的城市进行了大量实验，结果表明 HYSTL 优于最先进的基线。

Conclusion: HYSTL 能够有效地训练一个统一的、更强大的犯罪预测器，而无需假设不同城市记录中存在相同的犯罪类型。

Abstract: Predicting crimes in urban environments is crucial for public safety, yet
existing prediction methods often struggle to align the knowledge across
diverse cities that vary dramatically in data availability of specific crime
types. We propose HYpernetwork-enhanced Spatial Temporal Learning (HYSTL), a
framework that can effectively train a unified, stronger crime predictor
without assuming identical crime types in different cities' records. In HYSTL,
instead of parameterising a dedicated predictor per crime type, a hypernetwork
is designed to dynamically generate parameters for the prediction function
conditioned on the crime type of interest. To bridge the semantic gap between
different crime types, a structured crime knowledge graph is built, where the
learned representations of crimes are used as the input to the hypernetwork to
facilitate parameter generation. As such, when making predictions for each
crime type, the predictor is additionally guided by its intricate association
with other relevant crime types. Extensive experiments are performed on two
cities with non-overlapping crime types, and the results demonstrate HYSTL
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分解预处理架构，该架构通过结合线性组件和条件 NF 来降低 NF 复杂性，从而提高对目标几何的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于 NF 的方法不会使其架构适应目标分布，过度参数化的 NF 预处理器会降低采样效率和拟合质量。

Method: 该方法结合了线性分量与条件 NF，线性预处理器应用于从预热样本估计的近似高斯维度，而条件 NF 模拟更复杂的维度。

Result: 该方法在两个复杂的合成分布上产生明显更好的尾部样本，并且在不同似然和先验强度下，在稀疏逻辑回归后验上产生持续更好的性能。它还在具有弱可能性和强漏斗几何的分层贝叶斯模型后验上实现了更高的有效样本大小。

Conclusion: 该方法对于数据有限的分层贝叶斯模型分析特别有用，并且可以为神经 MCMC 设计中的当前理论和软件进展提供信息。

Abstract: Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling
efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target
distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often
sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has
explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as
components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical
studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling
efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt
their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC
similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or
superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose
a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by
combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to
target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are
approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional
NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail
samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better
performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood
and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on
hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel
geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian
model analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and
software strides in neural MCMC design.
