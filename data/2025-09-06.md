TL;DR: 利用语音进行痴呆症筛查，但仍有大量患者未被诊断。本研究比较了使用DementiaBank语音语料库进行痴呆症检测的大型语言模型适应策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国成年人中患有阿尔茨海默病和相关痴呆症的患者中，超过一半未被诊断，而基于语音的筛查提供了一种可扩展的检测方法。

Method: 在DementiaBank语音语料库的录音上，评估了九个纯文本模型和三个多模态音频-文本模型，采用上下文学习、推理增强提示、参数高效微调和多模态集成等适应方法。

Result: 结果表明，类别中心演示实现了最高的上下文学习性能，推理改进了较小的模型，token-level微调通常产生最佳分数。添加分类头显着改善了表现不佳的模型。在多模态模型中，微调的音频-文本系统表现良好，但未超过最佳纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适应策略，包括演示选择、推理设计和调整方法，对基于语音的痴呆症检测至关重要，并且适当调整的开放权重模型可以匹配或超过商业系统。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [2] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为RBA的框架，以提高SpeechLMs的语言生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SpeechLMs在指令跟随方面与基于文本的LLM相比仍存在显著的性能差距，尤其是在面对用户语音的动态和可变性质时。

Method: 采用了一种自我合成方法，通过强大的教师LLM生成广泛、高保真度的对齐数据，然后使用基于强化学习的方法使SpeechLMs的行为与教师的行为对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法有效地提高了SpeechLMs的指令跟随能力，优于传统的蒸馏基线。

Conclusion: RBA可以无缝扩展到包括口语问答和语音到文本翻译在内的任务，仅使用自我生成的数据即可在开放基准上获得最先进的性能。

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

### [3] [Multilevel Analysis of Cryptocurrency News using RAG Approach with Fine-Tuned Mistral Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03527)
*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文利用微调的 Mistral 7B 大语言模型和检索增强生成 (RAG) 进行加密货币新闻的多层次多任务分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在对加密货币新闻进行深入的定性和定量分析，提供重要见解。

Method: 使用 PEFT/LoRA 方法对模型进行 4 位量化微调，并结合图和文本摘要，将加密货币新闻表示为知识图谱。

Result: 结果表明，使用微调的 Mistral 7B LLM 模型可以进行信息丰富的加密货币新闻分析。

Conclusion: 结合图和文本摘要可以提供加密货币新闻的互补视图，将新闻表示为知识图谱可以有效解决大语言模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

### [4] [The ProLiFIC dataset: Leveraging LLMs to Unveil the Italian Lawmaking Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03528)
*Matilde Contestabile,Chiara Ferrara,Alberto Giovannetti,Giovanni Parrillo,Andrea Vandin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ProLiFIC，一个关于意大利立法过程的综合事件日志，时间跨度为1987年至2022年。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘(PM)在法律领域的应用受到数据集的可访问性和质量的限制。

Method: 使用大型语言模型(llm)从Normattiva门户的非结构化数据中创建ProLiFIC。

Result: ProLiFIC与PM集成与llm的最新努力相一致。初步分析示例表明ProLiFIC可以作为法律PM的基准。

Conclusion: 本文提出ProLiFIC作为法律PM的基准，以促进新的发展。

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

### [5] [Multimodal Proposal for an AI-Based Tool to Increase Cross-Assessment of Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03529)
*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于生成财报电话会议的语义丰富且结构感知的嵌入的新型多模态框架，通过将它们编码为分层话语树。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融情绪分析系统未能捕捉到财报电话会议的分层话语结构。

Method: 该方法使用双阶段Transformer架构，第一阶段使用对比学习在节点级别编码多模态内容和话语元数据，第二阶段为整个会议合成全局嵌入。

Result: 实验结果表明，生成的嵌入形成了稳定、语义有意义的表示，反映了情感基调、结构逻辑和主题对齐。

Conclusion: 该系统可推广到其他高风险的非脚本交流领域，例如远程医疗、教育和政治话语，为多模态话语表示提供了一种稳健且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

### [6] [Reading Between the Signs: Predicting Future Suicidal Ideation from Adolescent Social Media Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03530)
*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的任务和方法，即在青少年在网上论坛上明确表达自杀意念之前，根据论坛帖子预测自杀意念和行为（SIB）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是青少年死亡的主要原因，但预测自杀仍然是一个重大挑战。许多病例由于缺乏与精神保健服务的联系而未被发现。社交媒体提供了一个独特的机会，因为年轻人经常在网上实时分享他们的想法和挣扎。

Method: 我们引入了Early-SIB，这是一种基于transformer的模型，可以按顺序处理用户编写和参与的帖子，以预测他们是否会编写SIB帖子。

Result: 我们的模型在预测荷兰青年论坛上的未来SIB时，实现了0.73的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，此类工具可以为传统方法提供有意义的补充。

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

### [7] [Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531)
*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种廉价且可扩展的方法，用于实时识别长文本生成中的幻觉 token，并将其有效扩展到 70B 参数模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法不适用于实际应用，因为它们要么仅限于简短的事实查询，要么需要昂贵的外部验证。因此，需要一种更实用、可扩展的幻觉检测方法。

Method: 提出了一种针对实体级别幻觉的方法，并开发了一种利用网络搜索来注释模型响应的注释方法，该方法使用指示哪些 token 对应于捏造实体的 grounded 标签。使用该数据集训练有效的幻觉分类器。

Result: 该分类器在长文本响应中始终优于基线，并且在简短的问答设置中也有所改进。此外，尽管仅使用实体级别的标签进行训练，但 probe 可以有效地检测数学推理任务中的不正确答案，表明可以推广到实体之外。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一种有前景的、可扩展的、实际的幻觉检测新方法。

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [8] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的主题识别方法UDIB，用于检测大型语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测幻觉的框架依赖于语义发散指标（SDM），但SDM依赖于识别提示和响应之间共享的潜在主题，而这些主题是为了空间邻近性而优化，并非为了下游信息理论分析。这篇论文旨在弥合这一差距。

Method: 通过将确定性信息瓶颈（DIB）方法转化为高维数据的实用算法，用计算有效的上界代替其难处理的KL散度项，从而开发了一种基于DIB的主题识别方法UDIB。

Result: 通过将UDIB应用于LLM提示和响应嵌入的联合聚类，生成了一个共享主题表示，该表示不仅在空间上连贯，而且在结构上被最大程度地告知了提示-响应关系。这为SDM框架提供了更好的基础。

Conclusion: UDIB为检测幻觉提供了一种更敏感的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 构建一个多模态问题生成系统，自动生成不同内容格式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习者拥有丰富的教育资源，但缺乏针对这些资源的练习材料。

Method: 多模态输入处理、问题生成、基于人类反馈的强化学习 (RLHF) 和端到端交互界面。

Result: 为自动化、可扩展和智能的问题生成奠定基础。

Conclusion: 在资源效率、强大的功能和流畅的用户体验之间取得平衡。

Abstract: In today's information-rich era, learners have access to abundant educational
resources, but the lack of practice materials tailored to these resources
presents a significant challenge. This project addresses that gap by developing
a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

### [10] [AR$^2$: Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03537)
*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架，通过对抗性强化学习来提高大型语言模型(LLM)的抽象能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注表面模式识别，忽略了对抽象的显式训练。

Method: 使用教师模型将核心问题转换为具有丰富叙述性的挑战性描述，并训练学生编码模型来解决这些问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，AR2显著提高了学生模型在以前未见过的、具有挑战性的编程任务上的准确性。

Conclusion: 抽象是提高LLM泛化能力的关键技能。

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

### [11] [Improving Factuality in LLMs via Inference-Time Knowledge Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03540)
*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的框架，该框架在推理过程中动态构建和扩展知识图谱 (KG)，集成了从 LLM 中提取的内部知识和从外部来源检索的外部信息，以提高 LLM 事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 通常难以生成在事实上一致的答案，因为它们的参数记忆存在限制。检索增强生成 (RAG) 方法通过在推理时整合来自可信来源的外部知识来解决这个问题。然而，这些方法通常将知识视为非结构化文本，这限制了它们支持组合推理和识别事实不一致性的能力。

Method: 该方法首先通过提示从问题中提取种子 KG，然后使用 LLM 的潜在知识进行迭代扩展。然后通过外部检索选择性地完善图，从而增强事实覆盖率并纠正不准确之处。

Result: 我们在三个不同的事实问答基准上评估了我们的方法，证明与基线提示和静态 KG 增强方法相比，在事实准确性、答案精确性和可解释性方面均有持续改进。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，推理时 KG 构建是增强 LLM 事实性的一个有希望的方向，它以结构化、可解释和可扩展的方式进行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

TL;DR: 本文提出了多文档科学推理任务，旨在提取和对齐相关论文中的动机、方法和实验结果，以重建研究发展链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解科学思想的演变需要跨文档的结构化推理，而不仅仅是总结单篇论文。

Method: 提出了一个基于代理的框架ResearchPulse，该框架集成了指令规划、科学内容提取和结构化可视化。它由三个协同代理组成：用于任务分解的计划代理、构建动机-方法思维导图的Mmap-Agent和综合实验折线图的Lchart-Agent。

Result: 实验表明，即使使用7B规模的代理，我们的系统在语义对齐、结构一致性和视觉保真度方面也始终优于GPT-4o等强大的基线。

Conclusion: 本文形式化了多文档科学推理，并提出了ResearchPulse框架和ResearchPulse-Bench基准数据集。

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

Abstract: Note-taking is a critical practice for capturing, organizing, and reflecting
on information in both academic and professional settings. The recent success
of large language models has accelerated the development of AI-assisted tools,
yet existing solutions often struggle with efficiency. We present NoteBar, an
AI-assisted note-taking tool that leverages persona information and efficient
language models to automatically organize notes into multiple categories and
better support user workflows. To support research and evaluation in this
space, we further introduce a novel persona-conditioned dataset of 3,173 notes
and 8,494 annotated concepts across 16 MBTI personas, offering both diversity
and semantic richness for downstream tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that
NoteBar can be deployed in a practical and cost-effective manner, enabling
interactive use without reliance on heavy infrastructure. Together, NoteBar and
its accompanying dataset provide a scalable and extensible foundation for
advancing AI-assisted personal knowledge management.

*Aryan Gupta,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为 Sprinklr-Edge-OCR 的新型 OCR 系统，该系统专为资源受限环境中的边缘部署而优化。对五个大型视觉语言模型 (LVLM) 和两个传统 OCR 系统进行了大规模比较评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言、嘈杂和多样化的现实世界图像中进行光学字符识别 (OCR) 仍然是光学字符识别系统面临的重大挑战。随着大型视觉语言模型 (LVLM) 的兴起，人们越来越关注它们在固定 OCR 管道之外进行泛化和推理的能力。

Method: 构建了一个名为 Sprinklr-Edge-OCR 的新型 OCR 系统，并与五个最先进的 LVLM 和两个传统 OCR 系统在一个多语言图像数据集上进行了大规模比较评估。评估涵盖了广泛的指标，包括准确性、语义一致性、语言覆盖范围、计算效率和部署成本。还进行了边缘案例部署分析，评估了模型在仅 CPU 环境中的性能。

Result: Qwen 实现了最高的精度 (0.54)，而 Sprinklr-Edge-OCR 提供了最佳的整体 F1 分数 (0.46)，并且在效率方面优于其他系统，处理图像的速度提高了 35 倍（平均每张图像 0.17 秒），成本不到 LVLM 的 0.01（每 1,000 张图像 0.006 美元）。

Conclusion: 即使在法学硕士时代，由于传统 OCR 系统具有较低的计算要求、较低的延迟和非常高的可负担性，因此边缘部署的最佳 OCR 系统是传统的 OCR 系统。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）作为自动评估器时存在“自我偏好偏差”，倾向于偏袒自己的输出。研究表明，轻量级的steering vectors可以在推理时缓解这个问题，而无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为评估器时，其自我偏好偏差会损害评估的公平性和可靠性，特别是在偏好调整和模型路由等任务中。

Method: 1. 构建区分合理和不合理自我偏好示例的数据集。
2. 使用对比激活添加（CAA）和基于优化的方法构建steering vectors。

Result: steering vectors可以将不合理的自我偏好偏差降低高达97%，显著优于prompting和直接偏好优化基线。但在合理的自我偏好和无偏见一致性方面表现不稳定。

Conclusion: steering vectors作为LLM评估器的保障措施，既有潜力也有局限性，需要更强大的干预措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

### [16] [Semantic Analysis of SNOMED CT Concept Co-occurrences in Clinical Documentation using MIMIC-IV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03662)
*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了SNOMED CT概念共现模式与基于嵌入的语义相似性之间的关系，利用MIMIC-IV数据库，发现共现和语义相似性相关性较弱，但嵌入能够捕捉临床意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含丰富的临床叙述，但其非结构化格式对大规模分析提出了挑战。SNOMED CT等标准化术语提高了互操作性，但对概念如何通过共现和语义相似性相关仍然缺乏探索。

Method: 使用归一化逐点互信息（NPMI）和预训练嵌入（例如，ClinicalBERT，BioBERT），研究了频繁共现的概念在语义上是否也接近，嵌入是否可以提示缺失的概念，以及这些关系如何随时间和跨专业演变。

Result: 共现和语义相似性相关性较弱，嵌入捕获了临床上有意义的关联，而这些关联并不总是反映在文档频率中。基于嵌入的建议经常与后来记录的概念相匹配，支持了它们在增强临床注释方面的效用。概念嵌入的聚类产生了与患者表型和护理模式相对应的连贯临床主题（症状、实验室、诊断、心血管疾病）。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了共现统计和语义嵌入在提高文档完整性、揭示潜在的临床关系以及为决策支持和表型应用提供信息方面的互补价值。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的跨领域和目标的立场检测方法，即基于度量学习的小样本学习方法，用于跨目标和跨领域立场检测(MLSD)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用度量学习和三重损失来捕捉立场目标之间的语义相似性和差异，从而增强领域适应性。

Method: 通过构建有区分性的嵌入空间，MLSD允许跨目标或跨领域立场检测模型从新的目标领域获取有用的例子。

Result: 在多个跨目标和跨领域场景中，在两个数据集上评估了MLSD，结果表明，在六个广泛使用的立场检测模型中，立场检测性能在统计上有了显著的提高。

Conclusion: MLSD方法在跨领域和目标的立场检测任务中表现出显著的改进。

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SiLVERScore，一种用于评估手语生成的新型语义感知嵌入式评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手语生成评估方法（通过回译）存在局限性，无法捕捉手语的多模态特性，且难以确定评估错误的来源。

Method: 提出SiLVERScore，一种在联合嵌入空间中评估手语生成的方法。

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore在区分正确和随机配对方面表现出色 (ROC AUC = 0.99, overlap < 7%)，显著优于传统指标。

Conclusion: SiLVERScore 能够有效评估手语生成，且对语义和韵律变化具有鲁棒性，但也存在跨数据集的泛化挑战。

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

### [19] [Measuring How (Not Just Whether) VLMs Build Common Ground](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03805)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型（VLM）声称具有推理能力，但现有基准主要在单轮或问答环境中评估它们。本文提出了一个四指标套件，用于系统评估VLM在交互式 grounding 环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型视觉语言模型在交互式 grounding 环境中的性能，因为现有的基准测试无法充分评估

Method: 通过在三个专有的 VLM 之间进行 150 次交互式指称游戏，并与人类二元组进行比较，使用四指标套件（grounding 效率、内容对齐、词汇适应和类人性）评估 VLM 性能。

Result: 所有三个模型在至少三个指标上与人类模式不同，而 GPT4o-mini 总体上最接近。任务成功分数并不表示成功的 grounding，并且高图像-话语对齐不一定能预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 本文提出的指标套件和研究结果为未来 VLM grounding 研究提供了一个框架。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的用于超长文档机器翻译的评估框架Align-then-Slide，该框架通过对齐句子和滑动窗口评估来解决现有评估方法的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法假设句子与句子对齐，无法有效评估大型语言模型生成的文档级机器翻译的输出。

Method: 该框架包括对齐阶段和n-Chunk滑动评估阶段。在对齐阶段，自动推断句子级源-目标对应关系并重建目标以匹配源句子数量。在n-Chunk滑动评估阶段，计算1-、2-、3-和4-chunk下的平均指标分数以进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中，该方法与专家MQM排名之间的Pearson相关系数为0.929。在一个新策划的真实世界测试集中，该方法再次与人类判断紧密对齐。Align-then-Slide产生的偏好数据能够进行有效的CPO训练，并可直接用作GRPO的奖励模型，从而产生优于vanilla SFT基线的翻译。

Conclusion: 该框架是一种准确、稳健和可操作的文档机器翻译系统评估工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

*Huhong Xian,Rui Liu,Berrak Sisman,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的部分音频深度伪造检测（PADD）方法，该方法利用命名实体知识，通过两个并行分支：语音命名实体识别（SpeechNER）和PADD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的句子级音频深度伪造检测（ADD）与部分音频深度伪造检测（PADD）不同，部分音频深度伪造检测（PADD）需要对伪造语音的位置进行帧级定位。虽然在这方面已经取得了一些进展，但利用音频中的语义信息，特别是命名实体，仍然是一个未被充分探索的方面。

Method: NE-PADD 包含两个注意力聚合机制：用于组合注意力权重的注意力融合（AF）和用于使用辅助损失通过命名实体语义引导 PADD 的注意力转移（AT）。

Result: 在 PartialSpoof-NER 数据集上构建的实验表明，我们的方法优于现有的基线，证明了在 PADD 中集成命名实体知识的有效性。

Conclusion: 证明了在 PADD 中集成命名实体知识的有效性。

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了“胡说八道学”，一种在语法上连贯但在语用上矛盾的语言现象，并发现大型语言模型(llm)未能掌握其深层语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是发现当前的大型语言模型(llm)无法理解“胡说八道学”这种语言现象的深层含义。

Method: 构建了一个包含1200多个例子的基准数据集，涵盖英语、普通话、西班牙语、法语、日语和韩语，并评估了一系列llm在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: 研究结果表明，llm在理解“胡说八道学”方面存在明显的局限性，常常将其与肤浅的胡说八道混淆，产生语无伦次的理由，或者忽略了隐含的修辞功能。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了llm在语用理解方面存在更深层次的表征差距，并挑战了统计流畅性意味着认知理解的假设。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

TL;DR: 本文综述了基于CoT的推理对语言模型可信度的影响，包括真实性、安全性、稳健性、公平性和隐私五个方面。研究发现，推理技术在提高模型可信度方面有潜力，但同时也存在安全、稳健性和隐私方面的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于CoT的推理提高了语言模型在各种任务中的性能，但对于CoT推理如何影响语言模型的可信度仍然缺乏全面的理解。

Method: 本文对推理模型和CoT技术进行了综述，重点关注可信推理的五个核心维度：真实性、安全性、稳健性、公平性和隐私。对每个方面，按时间顺序提供了近期研究的清晰和结构化概述，以及对其方法、发现和局限性的详细分析。

Result: 推理技术有望通过减少幻觉、检测有害内容和提高稳健性来增强模型的可信度，但前沿的推理模型本身通常在安全性、稳健性和隐私方面存在相当或更大的漏洞。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为AI安全社区提供有价值的资源，以便及时了解推理可信度方面的最新进展。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

TL;DR: 探针方法检测LLM恶意输入存在问题，因为它们学习的是表面模式而非语义危害性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究利用探针方法研究LLM内部表示中恶意和良性输入的可分离性，并用于安全检测，但泛化性能差。

Method: 通过受控实验，从简单n-gram方法到语义清理数据集，再到模式依赖性分析，系统地重新检查这种范式。

Result: 证实探针学习的是指令模式和触发词等表面模式，而不是语义危害性。

Conclusion: 目前的探针方法存在虚假的安全感，需要重新设计模型和评估协议。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

TL;DR: MobileRAG is a mobile agent framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile agents rely heavily on LLMs, lack external environment interaction, and lack memory capabilities.

Method: We propose MobileRAG, a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Result: MobileRAG achieves 10.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Conclusion: MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks.

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM思想结构，称为Matrix of Thought (MoT)，通过列单元通信机制和事实修正机制，提高了LLM在复杂问答任务中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂和抽象的问答任务中，由于推理能力不足，性能显著下降。现有的Chain-of-Thought (CoT)和Tree-of-Thought (ToT)等方法存在层内冗余和单路径等问题，Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)方法难以有效利用大量信息。

Method: 提出了Matrix of Thought (MoT)，通过列单元通信机制在水平和垂直维度上探索问题，减少冗余，增强推理能力。构建知识单元，采用事实修正机制，增强LLM推理的初始知识，纠正错误答案。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的数据集上，F1和EM分数超过了最先进的方法，推理时间仅为基线方法的14.4%，展示了其效率和准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的MTQA框架在复杂问答任务中表现出色，具有高效和准确的优点。

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了KPoEM，一个新的用于现代韩国诗歌情感分析的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于文本的情感分类取得了显著进展，但由于其比喻语言和文化特性，诗歌（特别是韩国诗歌）仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 我们构建了一个包含7,662个条目的多标签情感数据集，包括来自483首诗的7,007个行级条目和615个作品级条目，并由五位有影响力的韩国诗人注释了44个细粒度的情感类别。

Result: 在此数据集上微调的最新韩国语言模型显著优于之前的模型，实现了0.60的F1-micro，而使用通用语料库训练的模型为0.34。

Conclusion: 这项研究连接了计算方法和文学分析，通过忠实地保留韩国文学的情感和文化细微差别的结构化数据，为诗歌情感的定量探索提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么需要访问通用指令数据，要么在保持模型原始分布方面存在限制。灾难性遗忘导致模型失去先前获得的知识和通用能力。

Method: 提出一种自分布对齐方法SelfAug，该方法对齐输入序列logits以保持模型的语义分布，从而减轻灾难性遗忘并提高下游性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，SelfAug在下游学习和通用能力保持之间取得了优越的平衡。揭示了分布偏移与RAG场景中灾难性遗忘的严重程度之间存在直接相关性。

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅加深了对RAG上下文中灾难性遗忘的理解，而且还提供了一种适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL: A new self-play fine-tuning method tailored for the Text-to-SQL task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPIN faces challenges in the Text-to-SQL task because it does not generate new information, and the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries.

Method: A verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach is introduced to synthesize high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the opponent model is proposed, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model.

Result: The approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on six open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL is effective for Text-to-SQL tasks.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 提出了VoxRole，一个用于评估语音角色扮演对话代理的综合基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究主要集中在文本模态，忽略了语音中的副语言特征，并且缺乏标准化的评估基准。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动流程，首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用LLM系统地构建每个角色的多维轮廓。

Result: 利用VoxRole，对当代语音对话模型进行了多维评估，揭示了它们在保持角色一致性方面的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: VoxRole是第一个专门为评估语音角色扮演对话代理而设计的综合基准，它包含来自261部电影的1228个独特角色的13335个多轮对话，总计65.6小时的语音。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为 CANDY 的基准，旨在评估大型语言模型 (LLM) 在事实核查中文错误信息方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在事实核查错误信息方面的有效性仍不确定，尽管它们的使用越来越多。为了系统地评估 LLM 在事实核查中文错误信息方面的能力和局限性，我们提出了 CANDY 基准。

Method: 我们整理了一个精心标注的约 2 万个实例的数据集。

Result: 目前的 LLM 在生成准确的事实核查结论方面存在局限性，即使通过思维链推理和少量样本提示进行增强也是如此。我们开发了一个分类法来对 LLM 生成的结论解释中的缺陷进行分类，并将事实捏造确定为最常见的失败模式。

Conclusion: 虽然 LLM 单独用于事实核查是不可靠的，但我们的研究结果表明，当作为辅助工具部署在场景中时，它们在增强人类表现方面具有相当大的潜力。

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

TL;DR: 本文致力于解决大型语言模型在低资源语言（如拉 Ladin 语）上的效果不佳问题，通过创建合成数据集并将其应用于机器翻译训练，为该语言的情感分析和多项选择问答任务提供了首个公开可用的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量的自然语言处理数据集对于极低资源语言仍然有限，这使得开发强大的语言技术变得困难。本文着眼于 Ladin 语，通过翻译意大利语数据来合成数据集，填补了这一空白。

Method: 利用少量的 Ladin-意大利语平行句子对，通过翻译意大利语单语数据，创建情感分析和多项选择问答 (MCQA) 的合成数据集。采用严格的过滤和回译程序以确保语言质量和可靠性。

Result: 将这些合成数据集整合到机器翻译训练中，与现有的意大利语-Ladin 语翻译基线相比，效果有显著提高。

Conclusion: 本文贡献在于为 Ladin 语创建了首个公开可用的情感分析和 MCQA 数据集，为这种代表性不足的语言建立了基础资源，可以支持更广泛的 NLP 研究和下游应用。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个名为RTQA的新框架，用于解决当前时间知识图谱问答（TKGQA）方法在处理复杂时间查询、推理能力有限以及分解框架中错误传播的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的时间知识图谱问答方法主要关注隐式时间约束，缺乏处理更复杂时间查询的能力，并且在分解框架中存在推理能力有限和错误传播的问题。

Method: RTQA框架采用递归分解问题的方法，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和时间知识图谱（TKG）知识自下而上地解决子问题，并采用多路径答案聚合来提高容错能力。该框架包含时间问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器三个核心组件。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试上的实验表明，RTQA在“Multiple”和“Complex”类别中取得了显著的Hits@1改进，优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: RTQA框架通过递归分解、LLMs和TKG知识以及多路径答案聚合，有效地解决了复杂时间知识图谱问答中的挑战，并在实验中取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在标准基准测试中表现良好，但在面对释义问题时效果会显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在面对真实世界中语言变异时的鲁棒性，并检验现有基准测试是否能真实反映模型能力。

Method: 系统地生成六个不同基准测试中所有问题的释义，并测量34个最先进的大型语言模型在这些释义问题上的效果变化。

Result: 大型语言模型在释义输入下的排名相对稳定，但绝对效果得分会显著下降。这表明大型语言模型在处理语言变异时存在困难。

Conclusion: 现有基准测试可能无法完全捕捉模型对真实世界输入变异的鲁棒性，因此需要更注重鲁棒性的基准测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Method: 使用模型相似性指标 $\kappa_p$ 分析 GlobalMMLU 中的 20 种语言和 47 个主题。

Result: 模型越大，跨语言一致性越高；模型自身的跨语言一致性高于与其他同语言模型的输出一致性。

Conclusion: $\kappa_p$ 可用于评估多语言可靠性，并指导开发更一致的多语言系统。

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

TL;DR: 本研究旨在构建一个基于RoBERTa的中文功能句法自动标注模型，以填补该领域的技术空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏针对中文文本的自动功能句法标注系统，限制了相关理论的应用和推广。

Method: 研究选取人民日报语料库，构建数据集并微调RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext模型，实现命名实体识别任务。

Result: 模型在测试集上取得了0.852的F1值，显著优于其他模型，但在识别不平衡标签样本方面仍有提升空间。

Conclusion: 本研究首次将功能句法与注意力机制的NLP模型结合，为中文功能句法分析提供了新方法，并为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Method: 提出了一个数据合成框架，生成文本和视觉两种模态的可验证乐谱问题，并使用强化学习进行训练。

Result: 在合成乐谱推理基准(ssmr-bench)上，Gemini 2.5-Pro表现不佳，而Qwen3-8B-Base和Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct通过强化学习有所提高。Qwen3-8B-Base在MusicTheoryBench上超越了GPT-4，并且数学问题上的表现也得到了提高。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了模型对乐谱的理解能力，并为人工智能辅助音乐创作开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Conclusion: 该方法在媒体分析、教育和情报收集等领域具有应用价值，通过提升叙事检测和解释能力，有助于更准确地理解和分析文本中的偏见和情感。

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Motivation: 在对话中，词汇对齐有助于交流成功。然而，会话代理中的词汇对齐尚未被充分探索，特别是考虑到大型语言模型(llm)的最新进展。

Method: 研究通过改变转录语音数据量和词性(pos)类别中包含的项目数量，构建个性化的词汇配置文件。使用召回率、覆盖率和余弦相似度指标评估了配置文件的性能。

Result: 研究表明，较小且更紧凑的配置文件在性能和数据效率之间提供了最佳平衡。这些配置文件是在10分钟的转录语音后创建的，形容词5个，连词5个，副词、名词、代词和动词各10个。

Conclusion: 本研究为构建稳定、个性化的词汇配置文件提供了实践见解，同时考虑了最小数据需求，为对话型AI中的词汇对齐策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注实体特征或话语关系特征，而很少关注两者的结合。

Method: 探索了两种联合建模实体和话语关系的方法。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，整合这两种类型的特征显著提高了连贯性模型的效果。

Conclusion: 同时对实体和话语关系进行建模有利于连贯性评估。

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

Result: MAGneT在生成咨询会话的质量、多样性和治疗一致性方面显著优于现有方法，在认知疗法评定量表（CTRS）上，一般咨询技能平均提高3.2%，CBT特定技能平均提高4.3%。专家在77.2%的情况下更喜欢MAGneT生成的会话。使用MAGneT生成的数据进行微调的模型，在CTRS上，一般咨询技能平均提高6.3%，CBT特定技能平均提高7.3%。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架能够有效生成高质量的心理咨询会话，并可用于微调开源模型，提升其心理咨询能力。代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的通用特征预测框架（GFP），用于高效的掩蔽骨骼建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将重建目标限制为原始关节坐标或其简单变体，导致计算冗余和有限的语义表示。

Method: 用高级特征预测取代传统的低级重建，引入协作学习框架，该框架动态生成跨时空层次的多样化监督信号，并结合约束优化以确保特征多样性。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60、NTU RGB+D 120和PKU-MMD上进行的实验表明，该方法具有计算效率（比标准掩蔽骨骼建模方法快6.2倍）和卓越的表示质量，在各种下游任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法优于现有的掩蔽骨骼建模方法，并在多个数据集上取得了SOTA结果

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于UNet分割的师生模型，用于解决有丝分裂检测和非典型有丝分裂分类问题，该模型集成了域泛化模块，并通过多任务学习范式提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学家进行有丝分裂计数耗时且存在观察者间差异。人工智能可以通过自动检测有丝分裂来解决这个问题，但AI工具容易受到领域转移的影响，并且有丝分裂的数量远少于正常细胞核，这导致检测任务的数据严重不平衡。

Method: 该方法将有丝分裂检测定义为像素级分割，并提出了一个师生模型，该模型集成了域泛化模块，包括对比表示学习和域对抗训练。采用师生策略为带注释的有丝分裂和硬阴性样本以及正常细胞核生成像素级伪掩码。对于分类任务，引入了一个多尺度CNN分类器，该分类器利用分割模型中的特征图。

Result: 在初步测试集上，该算法在Track 1中实现了0.7660的F1分数，在Track 2中实现了0.8414的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 该结果表明，将基于分割的检测和分类集成到一个统一的框架中，可以实现稳健的有丝分裂分析。

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [47] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为广义多重偏差缓解 (GMBM) 的框架，用于解决现实世界图像中存在的多种重叠偏差问题，这些偏差会损害视觉模型的鲁棒性和公平性。GMBM 通过自适应偏差集成学习 (ABIL) 和梯度抑制微调两个阶段来工作，并且引入了一种新的偏差度量方法，称为缩放偏差放大 (SBA)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉模型在处理具有多种重叠偏差的现实世界图像时，性能会受到影响，并且单独解决这些偏差是不够的，因为缓解一个偏差可能会允许或加剧其他偏差。

Method: 该论文提出了广义多重偏差缓解 (GMBM) 框架，该框架包含两个阶段：自适应偏差集成学习 (ABIL) 和梯度抑制微调。ABIL 旨在通过训练编码器来识别已知快捷方式的影响，并将其与主干网络集成，从而迫使分类器明确识别这些偏差。然后，梯度抑制微调会从主干网络的梯度中修剪这些偏差方向，从而留下一个忽略所有快捷方式的紧凑网络。

Result: 在 FB CMNIST、CelebA 和 COCO 数据集上的实验结果表明，GMBM 可以提高最差组的准确性，将多属性偏差放大减少一半，并降低 SBA 值。

Conclusion: GMBM 是一种实用的端到端多偏差解决方案，可以有效解决视觉识别中的偏差问题。

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级U-Net模型，用于左心室的精确分割，该模型在保持与nnU-Net相当的性能的同时，显著减小了模型大小和推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在超声心动图中心脏左心室的精确分割能够实现临床测量的自动提取，但现有模型体积大、速度慢，限制了实时应用。

Method: 通过消融研究，评估了nnU-Net中数据增强方案、架构修改、损失函数和后处理技术等最有效的组件，并在此基础上开发了一个轻量级U-Net。

Result: 轻量级U-Net模型（2M参数）在CAMUS数据集上实现了与nnU-Net统计上等效的性能（Dice系数分别为0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89），同时模型大小缩小了16倍，速度提高了4倍。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，简单的仿射变换和深度监督可以提高性能，而复杂的增强和大型模型容量的回报递减。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的treeX算法，用于从激光扫描数据中分割树木个体，作为深度学习方法的资源节约型替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的树木实例分割深度学习方法需要大量标注数据和计算资源。

Method: 结合了基于聚类的树干检测和区域生长进行树冠划分的无监督方法。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上评估，改进后的treeX算法在运行时间和精度上都优于原始版本，并且在TLS/PLS数据上达到了与开源方法相似的精度。对于ULS数据，也获得了较好的F1 score。

Conclusion: 该方法可以作为深度学习方法的替代方案，或者用于半自动生成深度学习模型的标签。提供了一个开源的Python实现。

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D: A new framework for 3D scene understanding using reconstructive geometry instruction tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LMMs struggle with 3D scene understanding due to the lack of geometric constraints in text-only supervision.

Method: Introduces Reg3D, a framework incorporating geometry-aware supervision with object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks in a dual-encoder architecture.

Result: Reg3D achieves substantial performance improvements on ScanQA, Scan2Cap, ScanRefer, and SQA3D.

Conclusion: Reg3D establishes a new training paradigm for spatially aware multimodal models.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有V2X协同感知研究主要关注精度，忽略了效率、延迟和实际部署等系统级问题，且大多依赖全精度模型，计算和传输成本高昂。

Method: 提出 QuantV2X，一个统一的端到端量化策略，同时降低神经网络模型和传输消息的计算量和带宽需求。

Conclusion: 全量化的多智能体中间融合系统在实际部署中是可行的。系统将公开发布以促进该领域的研究。

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Method: 使用包含 15 个不同物种的瑞典叶片数据集，评估了 ResNet50、MobileNetV2 和 EfficientNetB0 三种深度学习架构的性能。

Result: EfficientNetB0 的性能优于其他两种模型，测试精度达到 94.67%，精度、召回率和 F1 分数均超过 94.6%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，深度学习，特别是 EfficientNetB0，在开发基于叶脉特征的自动化植物分类工具方面具有潜力。

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图匹配网络方法在比较建筑平面图图时依赖于代价高昂的跨图节点级交互，导致推理速度慢。

Method: LayoutGKN使用可微图核作为最终学习的节点级嵌入上的距离函数，从而延迟跨图节点级交互。

Result: LayoutGKN在计算相似度方面与图匹配网络相当或更好，同时显著提高了速度。

Conclusion: LayoutGKN是一种用于比较建筑平面图图的有效且高效的方法。

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种参数高效的CLIP模型适应技术，它使用奇异值分解（SVD）来修改CLIP的内部参数空间，而无需注入额外的模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型（VLM）适应方法依赖于增强组件，例如提示令牌和适配器模块，这可能会限制适应质量、 destabilize 模型，并损害预训练期间学习的丰富知识, 因此需要一种更好的适应方法。

Method: 通过微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值来重新调整基础向量以进行领域自适应，同时保留预训练模型。

Result: CLIP-SVD在11个自然和10个生物医学数据集上实现了最先进的分类结果，在少样本设置下优于以前的方法，并且仅使用了模型总参数的0.04%。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD是一种有效的多模态和参数高效的适应技术，它可以在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下提高CLIP模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足全球日益增长的粮食安全需求，同时应对边缘设备上部署高精度模型的挑战，现有轻量级网络难以捕捉到细微的病理特征（如不规则的病变形状和复杂的纹理）。

Method: 1. 使用无训练的神经架构搜索方法 (DeepMAD) 创建一个高效的网络骨干；2. 引入形状-纹理注意力模块 (STAM)，将注意力分为两个分支：一个使用可变形卷积 (DCNv4) 来感知形状，另一个使用 Gabor 滤波器组来感知纹理。

Result: 在公共CCMT植物病害数据集上，STA-Net模型（具有401K参数和51.1M FLOPs）达到了89.00%的准确率和88.96%的F1分数。消融研究证实，STAM显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦注意力集成领域知识，为边缘部署的精准农业AI提供了一条有希望的路径。

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态至关重要，但由于光学畸变、水体浑浊和海洋生物的复杂特征而受到严重阻碍。

Method: 提出了一个名为 SLENet 的框架，该框架包含 Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE) 模块和 Localization Guidance Branch (LGB)，以增强多尺度特征表示，同时生成一个富含全局语义信息的位置图。

Result: 在 DeepCamo 数据集和三个基准 COD 数据集上的实验表明，SLENet 的性能优于 SOTA 方法。

Conclusion: SLENet 在更广泛的 COD 任务中具有很高的通用性。

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态图像训练忽略了时间信息，导致收敛速度慢、分布覆盖率有限和泛化能力降低。

Method: 该方法无需架构修改，可无缝集成到标准扩散训练流程中。

Result: 在HandCo数据集上，该方法加速收敛超过2倍，并在训练和验证分布上实现了更低的FID。它还通过鼓励模型捕捉有意义的时间变化来提高生成多样性。

Conclusion: 该正则化减少了梯度方差，从而加快了收敛速度。

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

TL;DR: MedVista3D：一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度语义增强视觉-语言预训练框架，可实现疾病检测和整体解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中，放射诊断错误（如漏读、无意视盲和沟通失败）仍然普遍存在。这些问题通常源于遗漏的局部异常、有限的全局背景和报告语言的可变性。

Method: MedVista3D执行局部和全局图像-文本对齐，以在完整体积上下文中进行细粒度表示学习。为了解决报告可变性问题，我们应用语言模型重写，并引入放射学语义匹配库以进行语义感知对齐。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答方面取得了最先进的性能，同时可以很好地转移到器官分割和预后预测。

Conclusion: MedVista3D是一个很有前景的3D CT分析框架，它通过多尺度语义增强视觉-语言预训练，在疾病检测和整体解释方面都取得了state-of-the-art的性能。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CaPL的因果引导文本提示学习方法，通过视觉粒化来提升CLIP模型在细粒度数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的提示学习方法在处理细粒度数据集时能力有限。

Method: 该方法包含两个模块：属性解耦模块（使用布朗桥扩散模型将视觉特征分解为非个体化属性和个体化属性）和粒度学习模块（通过整合属性，在两种因果推理策略下构建视觉粒度）。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验结果表明，CaPL方法显著优于现有的提示学习方法，尤其是在细粒度数据集上。

Conclusion: 通过学习到的视觉粒度，可以学习到更具区分性的文本提示。

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于事件相机的湍流缓解（TM）框架，该框架利用事件流的时空分布来提取无湍流引导，从而实现高效的幸运融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习TM方法计算和存储效率低，因为它们需要高容量网络来学习同步帧之间的粗粒度湍流动态。

Method: 提出了一种新的EGTM框架，该框架从显式但嘈杂的湍流事件中提取像素级可靠的无湍流引导，用于时间幸运融合。

Result: 该方法在模型大小、推理延迟和模型复杂度方面显著优于现有SOTA TM方法，分别提高了710倍、214倍和224倍，同时在我们的真实EGTM数据集上实现了最先进的恢复质量（+0.94 PSNR和+0.08 SSIM）。

Conclusion: 将事件模态引入TM任务具有很大的效率优势。

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process low-information regions uniformly, resulting in high computational costs and suboptimal performance.

Method: An Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality. A Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both modalities based on the sparsification results.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets.

Conclusion: FocusMamba achieves superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的食物识别方法难以识别未见过的食物类别，因此需要零样本食物学习（ZSFL）。

Method: 提出了 SalientFusion 方法，包含 SalientFormer 和 DebiasAT 两个模块。SalientFormer 去除背景冗余，并使用深度特征来解决角色混淆；DebiasAT 通过将提示与视觉特征对齐来减少语义偏差。

Result: 在 CZSFood-90 和 CZSFood-164 等基准数据集以及通用的 CZSL 数据集上，SalientFusion 取得了最好的结果。

Conclusion: SalientFusion 是一种有效的 CZSFR 方法，并在多个数据集上取得了state-of-the-art 的结果。

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due
to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing
heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing
surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive
overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by
providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing
over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human
motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the
comprehensive applications of digital humans. A complete list of the models

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为OccTENS的生成式 occupancy world 模型，该模型能够实现可控的、高保真的长期 occupancy 生成，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于自回归的方法在长期生成中存在效率低下、时间退化和缺乏可控性的问题。

Method: 本文将 occupancy world 模型重新定义为时间下一尺度预测 (TENS) 任务，并将时间序列建模问题分解为空间尺度生成和时间场景预测的建模。利用 TensFormer，OccTENS 可以有效地管理 occupancy 序列的时间因果关系和空间关系。此外，还提出了一种整体姿势聚合策略，以增强姿势可控性。

Result: 实验表明，OccTENS 在 occupancy 质量和推理速度方面均优于现有技术水平的方法。

Conclusion: OccTENS 是一种有前景的 occupancy world 模型，可以有效地解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

<details>

Motivation: 在跨不同类别进行匹配的挑战性环境中，对象的功能可以指导如何建立对应关系，因为实现特定功能的对象部分通常在形状和外观上具有相似性。

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型对多视图图像进行伪标记以获得功能部分，然后将其与像素对应的密集对比学习相结合，将功能和空间知识提炼到一个新模型中，该模型可以建立密集的功能对应关系。

Result: 结果表明，我们的方法优于由现成的自监督图像表示和基于视觉语言模型组成的基线解决方案。

Conclusion: 基于对象功能在建立对应关系中的指导作用，提出了一种新的密集功能对应关系的定义和学习范式。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Conclusion: 本文提出的 Attn-Adapter 框架能够有效解决视觉语言模型在少样本学习中的问题，并在泛化能力和效率方面取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling

Motivation: 现有评估长图像标题的标准指标要么不可靠，要么计算成本过高，要么与人类判断的相关性较低。

Method: SPECS 通过引入一个强调特异性的新目标来修改 CLIP 模型，从而奖励正确的细节并惩罚不正确的细节。

Result: SPECS 在与人类判断的相关性方面与基于 LLM 的开源指标相匹配，同时效率更高。

Conclusion: SPECS 是一种用于图像标题模型开发过程中迭代检查点评估的实用替代方案。

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided

architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端学习的多视角视频编码 (LMVC) 框架，该框架可确保随机访问和向后兼容性，同时提高压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角视频是体积视频的关键数据源，虽然能够实现沉浸式 3D 场景重建，但由于其海量数据量，在存储和传输方面带来了巨大的挑战。最近，基于深度学习的端到端视频编码已经取得了巨大的成功，但是大多数都集中在单视角或者立体视频，对于一般的多视角场景的探索还不足够。

Method: 为了利用视角间的运动相关性，我们提出了一种基于特征的视角间运动矢量预测方法，该方法以解码的独立视角运动特征为条件，对依赖视角运动编码进行编码，同时提出了一个学习视角间运动先验的视角间运动熵模型。为了利用视角间的内容相关性，我们提出了一种无视差的视角间上下文预测模块，该模块从解码的独立视角内容特征中预测视角间上下文，并结合了捕获视角间上下文先验的视角间上下文熵模型。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个端到端学习的多视角视频编码框架，该框架利用独立视角运动和内容信息来增强依赖视角压缩，在压缩效率上优于传统标准。

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt is a novel framework for topological refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures, which adopts a holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness. Topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown promise, but they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global preservation or correct geometric errors at inference.

Method: The proposed TopoSculpt framework (i) adopts a holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii) first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct errors from coarse to fine scales.

Result: Substantial improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving by nearly 10%.

Conclusion: TopoSculpt effectively corrects critical topological errors and advances the high-fidelity modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy.

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气胸是一种潜在的危及生命的疾病，胸部X光检查是主要的诊断工具，但小面积气胸可能难以发现。

Method: 使用带有EfficientNet-B4编码器的U-Net模型来分割气胸区域，使用数据增强和二元交叉熵加Dice损失的组合进行训练。

Result: 在独立的PTX-498数据集上，该模型达到了0.7008的IoU和0.8241的Dice系数。

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support
radiologists.

*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的零样本、无需训练的OOD检测方法，该方法利用多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）生成自适应负文本空间（ANTS），以提高远OOD和近OOD的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对OOD图像的理解，难以构建准确的负空间；同时，假阴性标签的存在会显著降低其近OOD性能。

Method: 1. 利用MLLM描述OOD图像，生成表达性的负面句子，以精确表征OOD分布并增强远OOD检测。
2. 识别与负面图像视觉上相似的ID类子集，并利用MLLM生成针对该子集量身定制的视觉上相似的负面标签，从而有效减少假阴性并提高近OOD检测。
3. 设计自适应加权分数以平衡这两种类型的负文本空间，从而使该方法能够处理不同的OOD任务设置（近OOD和远OOD），而无需依赖于特定于任务的先验知识。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，ANTS显着降低了4.2％的FPR95，从而建立了新的技术水平。

Conclusion: 该方法是免训练和零样本的，从而实现了高度的可扩展性，并且在开放环境中具有高度的适应性。

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态遥感变化检测（RSCD）方法，结合图像和文本模态以提高准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数遥感变化检测方法仅依赖于图像模态，限制了特征表示、变化模式建模和泛化能力，尤其是在光照和噪声干扰下。

Method: 引入图像特征细化（IFR）模块以突出关键区域并抑制环境噪声；采用视觉语言模型（VLM）生成双时相图像的语义描述；设计文本差异增强（TDE）模块以捕获细粒度的语义变化；设计图像文本特征融合（ITFF）模块以实现深度跨模态集成。

Result: 在 LEVIRCD、WHUCD 和 SYSUCD 上进行的大量实验表明，MMChange 在多个指标上始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 验证了 MMChange 对于多模态 RSCD 的有效性。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于执行WSI分类的空间感知相关多示例学习(SAC-MIL)方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决WSI分类问题，现有方法无法充分利用实例间的空间关系。

Method: 该方法包括一个位置编码模块和一个SAC模块，位置编码模块利用切片内的实例坐标来编码空间关系，SAC模块执行全实例相关。

Result: SAC-MIL在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SAC-MIL方法有效且易于部署，因为它不需要自定义CUDA内核。

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多任务学习框架，用于在无对比度增强的肝脏MRI中分割血管，利用辅助对比度增强MRI数据来减少对带注释训练示例的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在磁共振成像数据中进行肝血管分割对于血管重构的计算分析非常重要，这与广泛的弥漫性肝病有关。现有的方法依赖于对比度增强的成像数据，但必要的专用成像序列并未统一获取。没有对比度增强的图像采集频率更高，但血管分割具有挑战性，并且需要大规模的带注释数据。

Method: 该方法利用配对的原始和对比度增强数据（带有和不带有血管注释）进行模型训练。

Result: 结果表明，即使在推理过程中无法获得辅助数据，辅助数据也能提高血管分割的准确性。当只有少量注释可用于训练时，优势最为明显，因为特征表示受益于共享任务结构。

Conclusion: 辅助信息成像模式可以增强专家注释，即使它仅在训练期间可用。

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

*Mohamed Insaf Ismithdeen,Muhammad Uzair Khattak,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt design significantly impacts LMM accuracy in MCQA, with variations causing up to 15% accuracy deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LMM evaluations are not transparent due to sensitivity to prompt phrasing.

Method: Introduce Promptception, a framework with 61 prompt types to evaluate prompt sensitivity in 10 LMMs across 3 MCQA benchmarks.

Result: Proprietary models are more sensitive to prompt phrasing, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced phrasing.

Conclusion: Propose Prompting Principles for robust and fair model evaluation of proprietary and open-source LMMs.

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

### [77] [SliceSemOcc: Vertical Slice Based Multimodal 3D Semantic Occupancy Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03999)
*Han Huang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Jiaquan Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SliceSemOcc: A new framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction that uses vertical slices to extract voxel features and a new SEAttention3D module to improve performance, especially for small objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D semantic occupancy prediction methods overlook height-axis information and assign uniform weight across all height layers, limiting their ability to emphasize features at different heights.

Method: The paper proposes SliceSemOcc, a vertical slice based multimodal framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. It extracts voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical slices and uses a global local fusion module to adaptively reconcile fine-grained spatial details with holistic contextual information. It also proposes the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height layer.

Result: The proposed method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy datasets.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc framework is validated through experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了伪相关性在视觉Transformer中的影响，并强调了在未来研究中需要谨慎使用包含伪信号的图像。

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的多示例学习问题，并通过实验验证了所提出方法的有效性。

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机监控和国产芯片的应用提供了一种创新性的解决方案。

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time

heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming

Conclusion: 该重排序方法不需要模型微调或额外的注释，适用于大规模数据集，并且在计算效率方面优于其他重排序方法。

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多个关键指标上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Result: 使用 SpikingJelly 的基线脉冲神经网络 (SNN) 说明了数据集的可用性，并揭示了 sim-to-real 差距，从而激发了领域适应和多模态融合。

Conclusion: DVS-PedX 旨在加速基于事件的行人安全、意图预测和神经形态感知方面的研究。

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

*Ayan Banerjee,Josep Lladós,Umapada Pal,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion，一个用于生成多角色故事的框架，通过迭代过程保持角色一致性，并通过后处理实现准确的对话分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到故事可视化方法在角色一致性方面存在问题，导致伪影生成和不准确的对话渲染，从而导致故事不连贯。

Method: 引入 TaleDiffusion，利用预训练的 LLM 生成每帧描述、角色细节和对话，然后使用基于边界注意力的每框掩码技术来控制角色交互并减少伪影。应用身份一致的自注意力机制来确保跨帧的角色一致性，并应用区域感知交叉注意力来实现精确的对象放置。对话也呈现为气泡，并通过 CLIPSeg 分配给角色。

Result: 实验结果表明，TaleDiffusion 在一致性、降噪和对话渲染方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion 是一种用于生成多角色故事的新框架，它优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

*Yuan Zhao,Liu Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个多专家规划和生成框架（MEPG），以解决文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂提示和风格多样性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂提示和风格多样性方面存在局限性。

Method: 该框架包含位置-风格感知（PSA）模块和多专家扩散（MED）模块。PSA模块使用监督微调的LLM将输入提示分解为精确的空间坐标和风格编码的语义指令；MED模块通过跨局部和全局区域的动态专家路由实现跨区域生成。

Result: 实验表明，MEPG在图像质量和风格多样性方面显著优于具有相同主干的基线模型。

Conclusion: MEPG框架通过集成位置和风格感知LLM与空间语义专家模块，有效提高了图像质量和风格多样性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

TL;DR: 该研究重新审视了一种用于deepfake检测的baseline方法，并通过调整超参数，使其在Deepfake-Eval-2024基准测试中达到了与商业deepfake检测器相竞争的准确率（81%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有deepfake检测器在受控数据集上表现良好，但在真实场景中表现欠佳。Deepfake-Eval-2024是一个新的“in-the-wild”基准，旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 该研究改进了Ojha等人提出的baseline方法，该方法通过调整预训练的视觉backbone来生成通用的deepfake检测器。关键在于更好地调整超参数。

Result: 改进后的方法在Deepfake-Eval-2024上达到了81%的准确率，比之前的baseline提高了18%，与商业deepfake检测器相当。

Conclusion: 通过简单的超参数调整，可以显著提高现有deepfake检测器在真实场景中的性能，使其更具实用性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于YOLO的深度学习模型集成方法，用于提高无人机对风力发电厂缺陷检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的缺陷检测需要高分辨率数据和有效处理多光谱图像的方法。

Method: 该方法集成了通用YOLOv8模型和专用热模型，并使用复杂的边界框融合算法来组合它们的预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法的平均精度（mAP@.5）为0.93，F1分数为0.90，优于独立YOLOv8模型的0.91平均精度。

Conclusion: 结合多个YOLO架构与融合的多光谱数据提供了一种更可靠的解决方案，从而改进了视觉和热缺陷的检测。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

*Safouane El Ghazouali,Umberto Michelucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisioFirm is an open-source web application that streamlines image labeling through AI-assisted automation, reducing manual effort by up to 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image annotation tools are labor-intensive and limit scalability for large datasets.

Method: VisioFirm integrates foundation models like CLIP, Ultralytics, and Grounding DINO into a filtering pipeline to generate initial annotations, and uses Segment Anything for on-the-fly segmentation.

Result: VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90% reduction in manual effort while maintaining high annotation accuracy.

Conclusion: VisioFirm is an effective tool for streamlining image labeling with AI assistance.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

*Ruohong Yang,Peng Hu,Yunfan Li,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DUDE的无监督跨域图像检索方法，该方法通过解耦对象特征和特定领域的风格来进行图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的UCIR方法在对齐整个图像的跨域特征时，经常难以应对域差异，因为对于检索至关重要的对象特征经常与特定领域的风格纠缠在一起。

Method: DUDE利用文本到图像的生成模型将对象特征从特定领域的风格中解耦出来，从而促进语义图像检索。为了进一步实现解耦对象特征的可靠对齐，DUDE以渐进的方式将来自域内的互近邻对齐到跨域。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，DUDE在13个域上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DUDE是一种新颖的UCIR方法，它构建在特征解耦的基础上，通过解耦对象特征和特定领域的风格来进行图像检索，并实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高分辨率输入和复杂的多元素视觉交互下，如何使VLMs有效地对适当的图像区域进行推理仍然是GUI grounding中的一个核心挑战。

Method: 集成蒙特卡洛质量估计与基于IoU的区域质量评估，共同鼓励构建高质量偏好数据的准确性和多样性。这种组合明确地引导模型关注指令相关的关键区域，同时根据任务的复杂性自适应地分配推理步骤。

Result: 在ScreenSpot Pro和ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中表现出一致的性能提升。在GTA1-7B上进行微调时，LASER在ScreenSpot-Pro基准测试中取得了55.7分，在7B规模的模型中建立了新的SoTA。

Conclusion: 验证了该方法的有效性，并在ScreenSpot-Pro基准测试中取得了新的SoTA。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Motivation: 现有的GUI代理无法捕获页面之间复杂的转换关系，难以深入理解GUI环境并泛化到新的场景。

Method: 设计自动化流程将顺序操作转换为页面图，并引入RAG技术从页面图中检索可靠的GUI感知指南。此外，还提出了一个定制的多代理框架PG-Agent，该框架具有任务分解策略，可以注入指南，以便它可以推广到看不见的场景。

Result: 在各种基准测试中进行的大量实验表明，PG-Agent的有效性，即使在页面图构建的 эпизодов 有限的情况下也是如此。

Conclusion: PG-Agent框架能够有效地利用页面图结构和RAG技术，提高GUI代理的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

Motivation: 研究因果模型中部分可识别查询的计算问题，特别是在外生变量未完全指定的情况下。

Method: 提出一种新算法，利用内生变量的输入概率来简化多线性规划的构建。对于单次干预的情况，应用列生成技术，通过一系列辅助线性整数规划来计算概率界限。

Result: 实验表明，列生成技术优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 针对因果模型中部分可识别查询，提出了一种基于列生成的新算法，该算法在计算概率界限方面优于现有方法，并且在单次干预的情况下，外生变量可以使用多项式基数进行表示。

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的基于扩散概率模型的自主冲突消解框架Diffusion-AC，用于解决空中交通管理中的冲突检测与消解(CD&R)问题，该框架通过模拟反向去噪过程来生成丰富的多模态动作分布，并采用密度渐进安全课程(DPSC)进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度强化学习(DRL)的CD&R方法存在“单峰偏差”，导致决策缺乏灵活性，容易出现“决策死锁”。

Method: 该论文将扩散概率模型集成到CD&R任务中，构建了一个名为Diffusion-AC的框架，其策略被建模为由价值函数引导的反向去噪过程，从而生成多模态动作分布。此外，还提出了密度渐进安全课程(DPSC)训练机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，Diffusion-AC显著优于现有的DRL基准方法。在高密度场景中，Diffusion-AC保持了94.1%的高成功率，并将空中接近相撞事故(NMAC)的发生率降低了约59%。

Conclusion: Diffusion-AC通过其独特的多模态决策能力，提高了系统在高密度场景下的安全性，允许智能体灵活地切换到有效的替代动作。

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态规划框架，使LLM agents能够灵活地决定何时分配测试时的计算资源进行规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ReAct）总是进行规划，计算成本高，且在长时程任务中性能下降；而从不规划则会限制性能。

Method: 两阶段训练流程：(1) 在多样化的合成数据上进行监督微调，为动态规划做准备；(2) 使用强化学习在长时程环境中优化此能力。

Result: 在Crafter环境中的实验表明，使用该方法训练的动态规划agents具有更高的样本效率，并且能够始终如一地实现更复杂的目标。此外，这些agents可以有效地由人工编写的计划来引导，超越其独立能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次探索了在序列决策任务中训练LLM agents进行动态测试时计算分配，为更高效、自适应和可控的agentic系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

Motivation: 现有生成式 AI 模型（如 LLM）存在幻觉和不可验证声明的问题，限制了其在敏感领域的可靠性。检索增强生成（RAG）通过将输出基于外部知识来提高准确性，但在很大程度上仍然是一个黑盒，并且严重依赖数据质量。

Method: 本文开发了一种与方法无关的、基于扰动的框架，该框架为使用 SMILE 的 Graph RAG 提供 token 和组件级别的互操作性，并将其命名为 Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE。通过应用受控扰动、计算相似性并训练加权线性代理，KG-SMILE 识别对生成输出影响最大的图实体和关系。

Result: KG-SMILE 能够生成稳定且与人类对齐的解释。

Conclusion: KG-SMILE 能够在模型有效性和可解释性之间取得平衡，从而提高机器学习技术的透明度和信任度。

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在逻辑推理方面容易出错，缺乏类似人类的理解能力。本文介绍了一种神经符号系统 Embodied-LM，它将理解和逻辑推理建立在基于图像模式的模式化表征上，图像模式是源于人类认知的感觉运动经验的重复模式。该系统在 Answer Set Programming 中使用声明性空间推理来实现这些认知结构的空间基础。通过对逻辑演绎问题的评估，证明了大型语言模型可以在具身认知结构的指导下解释场景，这些结构可以被形式化为可执行程序，并且结果表示支持有效的逻辑推理，并具有增强的可解释性。虽然目前的实现侧重于空间原语，但它为整合更复杂和动态的表示奠定了计算基础。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL可以提高LLM的复杂推理能力，但其根本机制尚不清楚。通过分析，我们发现“顿悟时刻”、“长度缩放”和熵动态等现象是涌现推理层次的标志。模型最初受到程序正确性的约束，然后转向对高级战略规划的探索和掌握。现有RL算法（如GRPO）优化压力不分主次，导致学习信号稀释。为此，我们提出了一种层级感知信用分配（HICRA）算法，该算法将优化重点放在高影响力的规划token上。HICRA显著优于现有方法，验证了语义熵是衡量战略探索的更好指标。

Result: HICRA显著优于现有方法，验证了语义熵是衡量战略探索的更好指标。

Conclusion: 通过关注战略瓶颈，可以解锁高级推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）中的人格特质，发现指令对齐稳定了特质表达，但自我报告的特质不能可靠地预测行为，且角色注入对行为的影响不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM中类似人类的人格特质模式，这对于理解这些系统至关重要，但现有研究主要依赖简化的自我报告和启发式提示，缺乏行为验证。

Method: 系统地描述了LLM人格的三个维度：(1) 特质概况在训练阶段的动态出现和演变；(2) 自我报告特质在行为任务中的预测有效性；(3) 目标干预（如角色注入）对自我报告和行为的影响。

Result: 指令对齐显著稳定了特质表达并加强了特质相关性，但这与人类数据相似。然而，这些自我报告的特质不能可靠地预测行为，观察到的关联也经常与人类模式不同。角色注入成功地引导了自我报告，但对实际行为的影响很小或不一致。

Conclusion: 通过区分表面层面的特质表达和行为一致性，研究结果挑战了关于LLM人格的假设，并强调需要在对齐和可解释性方面进行更深入的评估。

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）的能力令人印象深刻，因此有人认为合成代理可以替代人类研究中的真实参与者。本文探讨了LLM在不同实验设置下是否保持内部一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM是否能作为人类研究中真实参与者的替代品。以往研究主要关注LLM生成的调查数据是否与人类对应，而本文关注LLM是否保持内部一致性。

Method: 设计实验揭示LLM的内部状态，并在基本对话环境中检查其行为。通过一系列行为假设，评估LLM的对话行为是否与其揭示的内部状态一致。

Result: 研究发现，不同模型系列和大小的LLM都存在显著的内部不一致性。LLM可能生成与人类相似的反应，但在内部一致性方面存在缺陷。

Conclusion: LLM在内部一致性方面的不足使其无法准确地替代人类研究中的真实参与者。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大型语言模型在面对高度专业化或意外的场景时经常失效，因此需要在海上风电（OSW）维护中保证准确性和安全性。

Method: 通过向两个索引发出并行查询，并为知识和安全分配单独的检索预算，RAGuard保证了技术深度和安全覆盖。此外，还开发了一个SafetyClamp扩展，用于获取更大的候选池，从而对安全进行“硬钳制”。

Result: RAGuard的两个扩展将安全召回率从RAG中的几乎0％提高到50％以上，同时保持技术召回率在60％以上。

Conclusion: RAGuard和SafetyClamp有潜力为在关键维护环境中将安全保证集成到LLM驱动的决策支持中建立新标准。

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）多智能体系统在复杂推理方面表现出潜力，但其有效性通常受到固定协作协议的限制，并且忽略了智能体内部的审议能力。

Method: 引入了元策略审议框架（MPDF），其中智能体在一组高级元认知动作（坚持、改进和让步）上学习分散策略。为了克服传统策略梯度的不稳定性，我们开发了一种新的强化学习算法SoftRankPO。

Result: 实验表明，与六种最先进的启发式和基于学习的多智能体推理算法相比，在五个数学和一般推理基准测试中，使用SoftRankPO的MPDF在平均准确率方面实现了4-5%的绝对收益。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为多智能体LLM系统学习自适应、元认知策略提供了一个范例，将重点从设计固定协议转移到学习动态、审议策略。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

Motivation: 在OMOP CDM中使用的数据标准化过程中，将源医学术语映射到OMOP标准概念是一个资源密集且容易出错的步骤。大型语言模型(llm)有潜力促进这一过程，但它们容易产生幻觉，这使得它们在没有训练和专家验证的情况下不适合临床部署。

Method: 该系统基于模型上下文协议(MCP)，MCP是一个标准化和安全的框架，允许llm与外部资源和工具进行交互。

Result: 该系统实现了可解释的映射，并在最小的努力下显著提高了效率和准确性。它提供实时词汇查找和结构化推理输出，适合在探索和生产环境中立即使用。

Conclusion: 该研究开发了一种有效的、可解释的、零训练的映射系统，可以提高医学术语映射的效率和准确性。

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的探索连续细胞自动机(CA)视觉模式的方法，通过结合局部新颖性驱动的扩展和目标导向的远征，利用视觉-语言模型(VLM)生成语言目标，引导探索未知的区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在连续细胞自动机(CA)中发现不同的视觉模式具有挑战性，因为高维行为空间非常庞大且冗余。传统的探索方法（如新颖性搜索NS）通过变异已知的解决方案进行局部扩展，但当局部新颖性耗尽时，通常会停滞不前，无法到达遥远的、未探索的区域。

Method: 引入了一种混合策略“Expedition and Expansion (E&E)”，该策略在局部新颖性驱动的扩展和目标导向的远征之间交替进行。在远征期间，E&E利用视觉-语言模型(VLM)生成语言目标，即对有趣但假设的模式的描述，从而驱动探索未知的区域。通过在与人类感知对齐的语义空间中操作，E&E以概念上有意义的方式评估新颖性并生成目标。

Result: 在Flow Lenia（一种以其丰富的涌现行为而闻名的连续CA）上测试，E&E始终比现有的探索方法发现更多不同的解决方案。家谱分析进一步表明，源自远征的解决方案对长期探索的影响不成比例，从而解锁了新的行为生态位，这些生态位可作为后续搜索的垫脚石。

Conclusion: E&E有能力突破局部新颖性边界，并以与人类对齐的可解释的方式探索行为景观，为人工生命及其他领域的开放式探索提供了一个有希望的模板。

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的代理，旨在简化 C2C 电子商务平台上的用户交互，通过自然语言命令自动执行关键工作流程，从而提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 C2C 电子商务平台用户需要在复杂的图形用户界面（GUI）中操作，买家和卖家都耗时。因此，需要简化这些交互。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于 LLM 的代理助手，作为 marketplace 的新入口，将交互模型从复杂的 GUI 转换为直观的 AI 代理。该代理通过解释自然语言命令来自动化关键工作流程。

Result: 实验表明，FaMA 在解决 marketplace 上的复杂任务时，任务成功率达到 98%，交互时间最多可加快 2 倍。

Conclusion: 基于 LLM 的对话式代理模式提供了一种轻量级且更易访问的替代传统应用程序界面的方法，允许用户更有效地管理其 marketplace 活动。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

TL;DR: DeepMedix-R1是一种用于胸部X光片(CXR)解释的医学基础模型(FM)。它通过顺序训练流程，利用高质量的合成推理样本，并进行在线强化学习，从而实现冷启动推理，并提高推理质量和生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学基础模型缺乏透明的推理过程和局部可解释性，阻碍了它们在临床上的实际部署。

Method: 该模型利用顺序训练流程：首先在精选的CXR指令数据上进行微调，然后利用高质量的合成推理样本来实现冷启动推理，最后通过在线强化学习来提高推理质量和生成性能。

Result: 定量评估表明，在报告生成和视觉问答任务中，DeepMedix-R1相比现有模型有显著改进。专家评审表明，生成的推理步骤具有更高的可解释性和临床合理性。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了医学FM向整体、透明和临床可操作的建模发展，用于CXR解释。

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的规划算法，将控制参数作为搜索空间中的决策点，而不是约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法将控制参数视为嵌入式约束，而不是决策点。

Method: 开发了一种最佳优先的启发式搜索算法，该算法在由控制参数定义的无限决策空间上运行，并利用延迟部分扩展的概念。

Result: 证明了该算法在一定条件下具有极限完整性，并展示了其在解决涉及控制参数的规划问题方面的竞争力。

Conclusion: 该算法为解决涉及控制参数的规划问题提供了一种有竞争力的替代方案。

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

Motivation: 具身智能中的一个持久挑战是使智能体能够稳健地适应新的领域，而无需大量的数据收集或重新训练。

Method: 该框架采用了一种基于原型的世界模型检索方法，利用有效的基于轨迹的抽象表示匹配，将相关的模型整合到测试时组合中。同时，开发了一种世界级的复合注意力方法，该方法不仅整合了来自检索到的世界模型的知识，而且还将它们的中间表示与智能体策略中的推理模型的表示对齐。

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFWorld基准测试中，WorMI在各种未见领域中表现出优于几种基于LLM的方法的zero-shot和few-shot性能。

Conclusion: 这些结果突出了该框架在具身智能体场景中可扩展的、现实世界部署的潜力，在这些场景中，适应性和数据效率至关重要。

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为 Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR) 的混合框架，旨在解决大型语言模型 (LLM) agent 在单任务和跨任务处理中存在的重复失败、效率低下和适应性有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么产生短暂且特定于任务的痕迹，要么需要大量的参数更新和计算。MPR 旨在克服这些局限性。

Method: MPR 将 LLM 生成的反思信息整合到结构化的 Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) 中，并通过软记忆引导解码和硬规则可接受性检查两种机制在推理时应用该记忆。

Result: 实验结果表明，与 Reflexion 基线相比，MPR 在执行准确性和鲁棒性方面均获得了持续的提升，并且规则可接受性进一步提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: MPR 通过外部化可重用的纠正知识、实施领域约束和保留基于语言的反思的适应性，从而改进了 LLM agent 的性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为 AutoPBO 的新框架，该框架使用大型语言模型 (LLM) 自动增强 PBO 局部搜索求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PBO 求解中的局部搜索求解器性能高度依赖于其内部启发式方法，但其设计通常需要大量专家工作和手动调整。大型语言模型 (LLM) 在自动化算法设计方面已显示出潜力，但尚未探索其在优化 PBO 求解器中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的、由 LLM 驱动的框架 AutoPBO，用于自动增强 PBO 局部搜索求解器。

Result: AutoPBO 在广泛的四个公共基准测试中进行了实验，与六个最先进的竞争对手相比，AutoPBO 表现出显着改进。

Conclusion: 结果表明，AutoPBO 为自动化局部搜索求解器设计提供了一种有前途的方法。

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的token级别强化学习框架无法与复杂的多步骤推理过程对齐。

Method: 论文从噪声和风险的角度分析了LLM推理过程。

Result: 实验验证了理论发现，并解释了过度思考等现象。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来更有效的推理agent的发展提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Abstract: Humans use representations flexibly. We draw diagrams, change representations
and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness
this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with
human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to
study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we
present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an
implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

Method: 通过对比三种数据集和七个大语言模型中的四种形式语言，研究形式语言的选择。

Result: 形式语言的选择会影响句法和语义推理能力，并且不同的大语言模型效果不同。

Conclusion: 形式语言的选择是神经符号大语言模型推理中一个被忽视的重要因素。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在紧急情况下，快速的路线重新计算至关重要。为了加速客机飞行路径的优化

Method: 训练一个强化学习代理来预先计算基于位置和大气数据的近优路径，并在运行时使用这些路径来约束底层的路径规划求解器，并在与初始猜测的一定距离内找到解决方案。这种方法有效地减少了求解器的搜索空间大小，从而显著加快了路线优化。

Result: 使用空客飞机的性能模型进行的实证结果表明，燃料消耗与非约束求解器几乎相同，偏差通常在1%以内。同时，与单独使用传统求解器相比，计算速度可提高高达50%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保证燃料消耗几乎不变的情况下，显著提高计算速度。

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

Motivation: 在扑克游戏中，不可预测性或诈唬是一项重要的技能。然而，大多数关于计算机扑克的研究都侧重于胜率等性能指标，而忽略了诈唬。

Method: 我们设计了一个实验，让DQN和CFR智能体相互对战，同时记录他们的行为。

Result: DQN和CFR都表现出诈唬行为，但方式不同。尽管两者都试图以不同的比率进行诈唬，但成功诈唬（对手弃牌）的百分比大致相同。

Conclusion: 这表明诈唬是游戏的一个重要方面，而不是算法本身。未来的工作应该关注不同的诈唬风格和完整的扑克游戏。

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

Result: 强调了中枢神经系统 (CNS) 在体验情感和理解行为后果方面的重要性，认为这是发展可持续伦理系统的关键。

Conclusion: 得出结论：即使人工智能在能力上超越人类，拥有 DNA 的人类仍然是宇宙领导者的最佳选择。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

Result: 对只有一元关系符号的无量词MLN，给出了随机结构可能极限行为的完整描述。对于偏好较少三角形的MLN，得到了关于一阶逻辑的“δ近似0-1定律”。分析表明，MLN使用的软约束会显著影响随机结构的极限行为，软约束的权重可能影响也可能不影响极限行为。证明了无量词MLN和提升的贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上是不可比的。表明在大型域上，MLN确定的分布几乎将其所有概率质量集中在与均匀分布完全不同的可能世界空间部分。

Conclusion: MLN的软约束和权重对随机结构的极限行为有重要影响。无量词MLN和提升的贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上是不可比的。在大型域上，MLN确定的分布与均匀分布有显著差异。

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为EvoEmo的进化强化学习框架，用于优化LLM智能体在谈判中的动态情感表达，旨在提高谈判效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM智能体在谈判中忽略了情感的功能性作用，容易受到操纵。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了EvoEmo。

Method: EvoEmo将情感状态转移建模为马尔可夫决策过程，并采用基于种群的遗传优化来演化高回报的情感策略。同时，提出了一个包含vanilla策略和固定情感策略的评估框架。

Result: EvoEmo在成功率、效率和买方节省方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 自适应情感表达对于提高LLM智能体在多轮谈判中的效果至关重要。

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

TL;DR: AlphaZero的适用性受限于测试环境与训练环境一致。本文探讨了在测试环境变化时部署AlphaZero agent的问题，并通过修改框架来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero通常假设训练环境与测试环境一致，这限制了其应用。本文旨在解决AlphaZero在测试环境变化时的部署问题。

Method: 通过对AlphaZero框架进行简单修改。

Result: 即使在低规划预算下，也能显著提高性能。

Conclusion: 对标准框架的简单修改可以显著提高性能。

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: MBTI-in-Thoughts框架通过MBTI人格类型，利用prompt工程来控制LLM agent的行为，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过心理学人格来提升LLM agent的效果。

Method: 通过prompt工程，使用MBTI人格类型来prime agent，控制其认知和情感。

Result: 不同人格类型的agent在不同任务中表现出可解释的行为偏差。例如，情感表达型agent擅长叙事生成，分析型agent在博弈论环境中采用更稳定的策略。

Conclusion: 该框架为心理学增强的AI agent奠定了基础，且可以推广到其他心理学框架。

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

*Matthew Ho,Chen Si,Zhaoxiang Feng,Fangxu Yu,Zhijian Liu,Zhiting Hu,Lianhui Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种通过概念级记忆来实现大型语言模型（LLM）在推理过程中进行持续学习的方法，无需更新模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的推理过程中的模式和见解在上下文窗口重置后会被立即丢弃，而外部记忆是一种持久化这些发现的自然方式。之前的研究表明，对于推理密集型任务，外部记忆有明显的优势。这篇论文旨在通过概念级记忆，使这些记忆更广泛地可重用和可扩展。

Method: 该方法从解决方案轨迹中提取可重用的、模块化的抽象概念，并以自然语言存储。对于未来的查询，有选择地检索相关概念并将其整合到提示中，从而实现测试时的持续学习。

Result: 在具有挑战性的ARC-AGI基准测试中，该方法相对于没有记忆的基线模型取得了7.5%的相对增益，并且性能随着推理计算规模的增加而持续提升。抽象概念被证明是最稳定的记忆设计。

Conclusion: 通过解决更多问题并将更多模式抽象到记忆中，可以实现自我改进。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动约束目标（ACT）框架，用于在推荐系统中自动调整超参数，以满足次要目标（“护栏”）的最低阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在保持一致的用户体验和平台生态系统，推荐系统通常必须最大化主要目标，同时确保次要目标满足最低阈值（“护栏”）。然而，尽管系统发生变化，但执行这些护栏具有挑战性，通常需要手动调整超参数。

Method: ACT框架使用无偏数据的离线成对评估来寻找解决方案，并持续重新训练以适应系统和用户行为的变化。

Result: 通过实验证明了ACT框架的有效性，并描述了其在大型生产环境中的部署。

Conclusion: ACT框架能够自动找到满足这些护栏所需的最小超参数变化集。

Abstract: Recommender systems often must maximize a primary objective while ensuring
secondary ones satisfy minimum thresholds, or "guardrails." This is critical
for maintaining a consistent user experience and platform ecosystem, but
enforcing these guardrails despite orthogonal system changes is challenging and
often requires manual hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Automated
Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework, which automatically finds the minimal set
of hyperparameter changes needed to satisfy these guardrails. ACT uses an
offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find solutions and continuously
retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes. We empirically
demonstrate its efficacy and describe its deployment in a large-scale
production environment.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的方法，利用大型语言模型（LLM）来估计位置偏差，以解决推荐和搜索系统中学习排序模型中的位置偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推荐和搜索系统依赖于学习排序模型，但用户交互数据受位置偏差影响，导致模型继承和强化先前的偏差。准确估计倾向性是具有挑战性的，尤其是在具有复杂非线性布局的界面中。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新颖的方法，使用大型语言模型（LLM）应用于记录的用户交互数据来估计位置偏差。

Result: 实验表明，使用LLM估计的倾向性在分数桶中是稳定的，并揭示了Viator网格布局的行-列效应。使用这些倾向性训练的IPS加权重排序器在标准NDCG@10上与生产模型匹配，同时将加权NDCG@10提高了约2%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种利用LLM估计位置偏差的有效方法，并在离线实验中取得了显著的改进，未来的在线实验将验证这些离线收益。

Abstract: Recommender and search systems commonly rely on Learning To Rank models
trained on logged user interactions to order items by predicted relevance.
However, such interaction data is often subject to position bias, as users are
more likely to click on items that appear higher in the ranking, regardless of
their actual relevance. As a result, newly trained models may inherit and
reinforce the biases of prior ranking models rather than genuinely improving
relevance. A standard approach to mitigate position bias is Inverse Propensity
Scoring (IPS), where the model's loss is weighted by the inverse of a
propensity function, an estimate of the probability that an item at a given
position is examined. However, accurate propensity estimation is challenging,
especially in interfaces with complex non-linear layouts. In this paper, we
propose a novel method for estimating position bias using Large Language Models
(LLMs) applied to logged user interaction data. This approach offers a
cost-effective alternative to online experimentation. Our experiments show that
propensities estimated with our LLM-as-a-judge approach are stable across score
buckets and reveal the row-column effects of Viator's grid layout that simpler
heuristics overlook. An IPS-weighted reranker trained with these propensities
matches the production model on standard NDCG@10 while improving weighted
NDCG@10 by roughly 2%. We will verify these offline gains in forthcoming
live-traffic experiments.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的方法，将商品ID作为LLM中的一等公民，以提高推荐质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM推荐方法难以处理大规模商品目录，通常需要将商品ID进行tokenize，导致效率瓶颈。

Method: 该论文提出了一种简单但有效的训练和推理修改方法，以实现商品的单token表示和单步解码。

Result: 该方法在Amazon购物数据集上，推荐质量（召回率和NDCG）优于现有技术，同时推理效率提高了5-14倍。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个不同于其他LLM推荐方法的效率视角，为将ID集成到LLM中开辟了一个新方向。

Abstract: Integrating product catalogs and user behavior into LLMs can enhance
recommendations with broad world knowledge, but the scale of real-world item
catalogs, often containing millions of discrete item identifiers (Item IDs),
poses a significant challenge. This contrasts with the smaller, tokenized text
vocabularies typically used in LLMs. The predominant view within the LLM-based
recommendation literature is that it is infeasible to treat item ids as a first
class citizen in the LLM and instead some sort of tokenization of an item into
multiple tokens is required. However, this creates a key practical bottleneck
in serving these models for real-time low-latency applications.
  Our paper challenges this predominant practice and integrates item ids as
first class citizens into the LLM. We provide simple, yet highly effective,
novel training and inference modifications that enable single-token
representations of items and single-step decoding. Our method shows
improvements in recommendation quality (Recall and NDCG) over existing
techniques on the Amazon shopping datasets while significantly improving
inference efficiency by 5x-14x. Our work offers an efficiency perspective
distinct from that of other popular approaches within LLM-based recommendation,
potentially inspiring further research and opening up a new direction for
integrating IDs into LLMs. Our code is available here

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工标注成本高、周期长，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 使用微调的LLM来自动进行相关性评估。

Result: LLM生成的判断与人工标注高度一致，且提高了评估效率，扩大了查询范围，优化了抽样设计，并能有效评估更大范围的搜索体验。该方法提高了相关性指标的质量，并显著降低了在线实验测量中的最小可检测效应（MDE）。

Conclusion: LLM可以为实验提供可靠的相关性测量，同时大大提高评估效率。

Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to
ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human
annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost
and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our
approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online
experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between
LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can
provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving
the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the
opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and
efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach
leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum
Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiment measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG 系统通过提供检索到的证据来支持大型语言模型 (LLM) 的响应，从而在事实上对 LLM 的响应进行接地。但是，LLM 可能会吸收和复制检索到的证据中存在的不实信息。如果检索到的证据包含明确旨在传播不实信息的对抗性材料，则此问题会更加严重。

Method: 本文在健康领域进行了系统的 RAG 鲁棒性评估，并检查了模型输出与真实答案之间的一致性。我们使用常见的健康问题进行对照实验，改变检索文档的类型和组成（有帮助的、有害的和对抗性的），以及用户提问的框架（一致的、中立的和不一致的）。

Result: 对抗性文档会显著降低对齐效果，但如果检索池中也存在有用的证据，则可以保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在高风险领域设计更安全的 RAG 系统提供了可操作的见解，强调了对检索保障措施的需求。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github
repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的命名实体识别依赖于固定模式或微调模型，无法灵活处理用户自定义的类型描述。

Method: 利用大型语言模型的内部表征，将实体提及和用户提供的开放式类型描述嵌入到共享语义空间中。训练轻量级的对比投影网络来对齐类型兼容的实体，同时分离不相关的类型。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，NER Retriever显著优于词汇和密集句子级检索基线。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM中的表征选择提供了实证支持，并展示了一种可扩展的、无模式实体检索的实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER
Retriever Codebase is publicly available at

Motivation: 理解和检索复杂的技术内容具有挑战性。

Method: 通过利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 的能力，首先，通过生成扩展的表示来增强用户查询，从而更好地捕获用户意图并提高数据集多样性，从而丰富嵌入模型的微调过程。其次，我们应用摘要提取技术来编码重要的上下文信息，从而完善技术文档的表示。

Conclusion: 集成查询扩展和上下文摘要可以有效增强技术领域的信息访问和理解。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Technical-Embeddings, a novel framework designed
to optimize semantic retrieval in technical documentation, with applications in
both hardware and software development. Our approach addresses the challenges
of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by
generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve
dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding
models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential
contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To
further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model
using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries
and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our
approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that
Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both
precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating
query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and
comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for
efficient and accurate technical document retrieval in engineering and product
development workflows.

Abstract: With the dynamic evolution of user interests and the increasing multimodal
demands in internet applications, personalized content generation strategies
based on static interest preferences struggle to meet practical application
requirements. The proposed TIMGen (Temporal Interest-driven Multimodal
Generation) model addresses this challenge by modeling the long-term temporal
evolution of users' interests and capturing dynamic interest representations
with strong temporal dependencies. This model also supports the fusion of
multimodal features, such as text, images, video, and audio, and delivers
customized content based on multimodal preferences. TIMGen jointly learns
temporal dependencies and modal preferences to obtain a unified interest
representation, which it then generates to meet users' personalized content
needs. TIMGen overcomes the shortcomings of personalized content recommendation
methods based on static preferences, enabling flexible and dynamic modeling of
users' multimodal interests, better understanding and capturing their interests
and preferences. It can be extended to a variety of practical application
scenarios, including e-commerce, advertising, online education, and precision
medicine, providing insights for future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新颖的上下游框架，用于构建用户和物品 (Pin) 的嵌入，这对于 Pinterest 有效地提供个性化的 Pin 和广告至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用复杂架构捕获 Pinterest 上用户和 Pin 之间复杂关系

Method: 利用上游模型训练广泛的数据源，提取用户和item的嵌入向量，并定期刷新，然后将这些嵌入作为输入特征整合到下游任务中，包括广告检索和CTR/CVR预测的排序模型。

Result: 该框架在各种下游任务的离线和在线设置中均实现了显着的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架已部署在 Pinterest 的生产广告排序系统中，从而显着提高了在线指标。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework following an
upstream-downstream paradigm to construct user and item (Pin) embeddings from
diverse data sources, which are essential for Pinterest to deliver personalized
Pins and ads effectively. Our upstream models are trained on extensive data
sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture
intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure
scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and
regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for
asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These
embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks,
including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We
demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in
both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This
framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems,
resulting in significant gains in online metrics.

### [142] [Global-to-Local or Local-to-Global? Enhancing Image Retrieval with Efficient Local Search and Effective Global Re-ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04351)
*Dror Aiger,Bingyi Cao,Kaifeng Chen,Andre Araujo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像检索范式，即从局部到全局的检索，它结合了高效的局部特征搜索和有效的全局特征重排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像检索系统的主流范式是使用全局图像特征搜索大型数据库，然后使用局部图像特征匹配技术对初始结果进行重排序。这种设计是由于局部匹配方法的计算成本很高，只能用于少量检索图像。然而，新兴的高效局部特征搜索方法开辟了新的可能性，特别是在大规模上实现详细检索，以找到全局特征搜索经常遗漏的部分匹配。

Method: 本文利用这些构建块，引入了一种局部到全局的检索范式，其中高效的局部特征搜索与有效的全局特征重排序相结合。关键是，我们提出了一种重排序方法，其中全局特征是基于局部特征检索相似性动态计算的。这种仅重排序的全局特征利用多维缩放技术来创建嵌入，从而尊重搜索期间获得的局部相似性，从而显着提高重排序效果。

Result: 在实验上，我们展示了可靠的检索性能，在修订的牛津和巴黎数据集上设置了新的最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的图像检索范式，即从局部到全局的检索，它结合了高效的局部特征搜索和有效的全局特征重排序，并在修订的牛津和巴黎数据集上取得了新的最先进的结果。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

### [143] [The Optimiser Hidden in Plain Sight: Training with the Loss Landscape's Induced Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03594)
*Thomas R. Harvey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一类新的神经网络优化器，它利用了损失景观嵌入到高维空间时自然产生的黎曼度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过采用这种几何视角并使用诱导度量，开发了一种新的优化器，并将其与现有方法（即：SGD、Adam、AdamW 和 Muon）在各种任务和架构中进行比较。

Method: 利用黎曼度量开发新的优化器。

Result: 这种新的优化器类在低维示例中非常有效，并且比训练神经网络的最先进方法略有改进。

Conclusion: 从理论上讲，这些新的优化器具有理想的属性。

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

Result: CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Its versatility enables rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting without the need for task-specific retraining.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

*E. Khalafyan,A. E. Allahverdyan,A. Hovhannisyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了非负矩阵分解 (NMF) 和概率因果关系中的共同原因原则 (PCC) 之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究NMF和PCC之间的关系，利用PCC来改进NMF的性能，并使用NMF来实现PCC。

Method: 将灰度图像数据集映射到概率模型，并使用PCC来估计NMF的有效秩。然后，围绕这个秩实现NMF，并将其用于聚类和数据降噪。

Result: PCC可以提供一种预测工具，从而可以对NMF的有效秩进行稳健的估计，并且NMF可以为实现PCC提供有趣的可能性。

Conclusion: NMF和PCC密切相关，并且可以相互促进。

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的半去中心化联邦学习客户端选择方法 FedDeCAB，以解决物联网中时间序列数据下客户端可用性对联邦学习性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在物联网 (IoT) 场景中有效促进了具有隐私考虑的分布式客户端之间的协同训练。但是，由于数据异构性，联邦学习客户端可能还会受到有限的能量和可用性预算的限制。因此，有效选择参与训练的客户端对于全局模型的收敛和客户端贡献的平衡至关重要。

Method: 该文讨论了时间序列数据下客户端可用性对联邦学习的性能影响。设置了三种影响时间序列数据可用性的不同场景，并提出了一种新的半去中心化客户端选择方法 FedDeCAB，该方法应用可用客户端的概率排名。当客户端与服务器断开连接时，FedDeCAB 允许从最近的邻居客户端获取部分模型参数以进行联合优化，从而提高离线模型的性能并减少通信开销。

Result: 基于真实世界的大规模出租车和船舶轨迹数据集的实验表明，FedDeCAB 在高度异构的数据分布、有限的通信预算以及动态客户端离线或重新加入的情况下是有效的。

Conclusion: 在时间序列数据下，客户端可用性对联邦学习的性能有影响，FedDeCAB 是一种有效的客户端选择方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SharedRep-RLHF的新框架，以解决现有MaxMin-RLHF方法在少数群体奖励不足时的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的uniform-reward RLHF方法无法捕捉不同人群的意见多样性，MaxMin-RLHF在最小奖励群体是少数群体时表现不佳。

Method: SharedRep-RLHF学习并利用不同群体注释中的共享特征，而不是为每个群体学习单独的奖励模型。

Result: 在各种自然语言任务上的实验表明，与MaxMin-RLHF相比，SharedRep-RLHF的胜率提高了20%。

Conclusion: SharedRep-RLHF在学习共享特征方面优于MaxMin-RLHF，并且在实际应用中表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

Motivation: 随着基础模型（FMs）的兴起，利用无线设备的地理分布式数据变得越来越重要，从而产生了联邦基础模型（FFMs）。最近，FMs 已经发展成为能够处理跨多个任务的不同模态的多模态多任务（M3T）FMs，这激发了一种新的未被探索的范例：M3T FFMs。

Result: 在无线网络环境中对 HF-FMs 进行了原型设计，并发布了 HF-FMs 的开源代码。

Conclusion: HF-FMs 具有独特的功能，并提供了一系列量身定制的未来研究方向，旨在促进对这个未开发领域的探索。

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse
modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为EmbedOR的SNE算法，旨在解决UMAP和tSNE等算法在处理噪声和高维数据时几何结构保存不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SNE算法（如UMAP和tSNE）在可视化噪声和高维数据时，不能很好地保持数据的几何结构，可能错误地分离连接的数据成分，且无法在可聚类数据中找到簇。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新的SNE算法EmbedOR，它结合了离散图曲率，使用曲率增强的距离度量来随机嵌入数据，从而强调潜在的聚类结构。

Result: 论文通过在合成和真实数据上的大量实验表明，EmbedOR具有良好的可视化和几何保持能力，与其他SNE算法和UMAP不同，EmbedOR不太可能分割数据中连续的高密度区域。

Conclusion: EmbedOR的距离度量可以作为注释现有可视化的工具，以识别碎片并提供对数据底层几何结构的更深入了解。

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

*Zhiqiu Xu,Amish Sethi,Mayur Naik,Ser-Nam Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出 Delta Activations 方法，用向量嵌入表示微调模型，通过测量模型内部激活相对于基础模型的偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源大型语言模型微调后数量巨大，但由于元数据不一致和存储库结构不规范，难以导航和理解这些模型。

Method: 通过测量微调模型内部激活相对于基础模型的偏移，将微调模型表示为向量嵌入。

Result: Delta Activations 方法能够按领域和任务对模型进行有效聚类，揭示模型结构；在不同的微调设置中表现出鲁棒性；在混合微调数据集时表现出可加性；可以通过少量样本微调嵌入任务；可用于模型选择和合并。

Conclusion: Delta Activations 方法可以促进公共可用模型的重用。

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

### [156] [Online Learning of Optimal Sequential Testing Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03707)
*Qiyuan Chen,Raed Al Kontar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个在线学习问题，旨在为一系列受试者寻找最佳测试策略，每个受试者都可以通过一系列来自共同池的候选测试进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当测试相关且成本高昂时，仅选择一个子集并做出具有部分信息的决策通常更可取。当受试者未完全测试时，由此产生的缺失数据可能会使估计产生偏差，从而使问题从根本上比标准情景MDP更难。

Method: 我们提出了一个Explore-Then-Commit算法。

Result: 我们证明了minimax遗憾必须至少按$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$缩放，与情景MDP中的$\Theta(\sqrt{T})$速率形成对比，揭示了缺失引入的难度。对于离散和高斯分布，累积遗憾为$\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$。

Conclusion: 这项工作加深了对缺失数据下探索-利用权衡的理解，并指导了有效序列测试策略的设计。

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

### [158] [Differentiable Entropy Regularization for Geometry and Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03733)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个可微的范围分割熵估计器，使算法能够适应其输入的“有序性”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 范围分割熵在算法设计中提供了强大的保证，但尚未应用于深度学习。

Method: 1. 提出了第一个范围分割熵的可微近似，使其可用作可训练的损失或正则化器; 2. 设计了EntropyNet，一个将数据重构为低熵形式的神经模块，以加速下游实例最优算法; 3. 通过将熵正则化直接应用于Transformer注意力，将这一原则扩展到几何之外。

Result: 在各种任务中，可微熵提高了效率，且不降低正确性：在几何中，该方法实现了高达4.1倍的运行时加速，误差可忽略不计（<0.2%）；在深度学习中，它诱导了结构化的注意力模式，与L1基线相比，在80%的稀疏性下，准确率提高了6%。

Conclusion: 熵界计算不仅在理论上是优雅的，而且是自适应学习、效率和结构化表示的实用机制。

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy, a recent
concept from computational geometry that enables algorithms to adapt to the
"sortedness" of their input. While range-partition entropy provides strong
guarantees in algorithm design, it has not yet been made accessible to deep
learning. In this work, we (i) propose the first differentiable approximation
of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于统一神经模型表示的框架，该框架将稀疏自编码器 (SAE) 扩展到提升空间和无限维函数空间，从而实现对大型神经算子 (NO) 的机械可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经算子在科学计算中的重要性日益增加，但神经算子的表示特性仍未得到充分探索。Platonic Representation Hypothesis 认为神经网络在不同架构中会收敛到相似的表示。

Method: 比较了 SAE、lifted-SAE 和 SAE 神经算子的推理和训练动态。

Result: 提升和算子模块引入了有益的归纳偏差，从而能够实现更快的恢复，改进平滑概念的恢复，以及在不同分辨率下进行稳健的推理，这是神经算子独有的属性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架能够更好地统一神经模型的表示，并为神经算子的可解释性提供了新的途径。

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 机器学习在卫星图像应用中受限于标记训练数据的稀疏性。本文提出了一个空间训练数据优化问题，考虑了异构数据收集成本和预算约束，并提出了新的解决方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的卫星图像机器学习研究主要集中在新的模型架构和训练算法上，而忽略了直接对数据条件进行建模。这使得科学家和政策制定者难以确定如何收集额外数据以最大限度地提高性能。

Method: 提出了第一个在存在异构数据收集成本和实际预算约束的情况下优化空间训练数据的问题公式，以及解决该问题的新方法。

Result: 在模拟不同问题设置的实验中，我们的策略显示了样本优化带来的显著收益。进一步的实验划定了优化抽样特别有效的设置。

Conclusion: 我们提出的问题公式和方法旨在推广到卫星图像机器学习的各个应用领域。

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决高维数据的计算挑战，引入了基于距离矩阵低秩结构的降维策略。

Method: 该方法利用扩散几何及其与热方程和 Laplace-Beltrami 算子的联系，构建到环境空间的平滑扩展。此外，还开发了一种在线更新机制，可以有效整合新数据。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在精度和效率方面均优于传统的前馈神经网络和插值方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏 CT 重建等应用中表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体的潜力受限于手工制作的训练环境的复杂性和偏差。为了开发真正可泛化和鲁棒的智能体，需要能够随着智能体学习而扩展复杂性的环境。

Method: 该方法将环境生成重构为学习目标条件生成世界模型的问题。一个生成式攻击者智能体学习一个隐式世界模型，以合成越来越难的挑战，对抗一组合作的防御者智能体。

Result: 该框架能够涌现出复杂的行为，例如世界模型学习生成侧翼和盾牌阵型，而防御者学习协调的集火和分散战术。

Conclusion: 对抗性共同进化是学习工具性世界模型的有效方法，可以推动智能体朝着更大的战略深度和鲁棒性发展。

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究奖励函数的低秩结构如何影响稀疏奖励强化学习的效率。

Method: 提出了策略感知矩阵补全（PAMC）方法，将矩阵补全理论与强化学习联系起来，并通过对策略相关抽样的新分析。

Result: 发现超过一半的系统抽样领域存在可利用的结构，PAMC与强探索、结构化和表征学习基线相比，样本效率提高了1.6到2.1倍，而计算开销仅增加了约20%。

Conclusion: 结构化奖励学习是一种很有前途的新范例，对机器人、医疗保健和其他安全关键、样本昂贵的应用具有直接意义。

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural
reward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for
robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测在各个领域都很重要，但由于分布偏移而面临重大挑战，尤其是在在线部署场景中。

Result: 大量实验表明，ADAPT-Z 方法在多个数据集上始终优于标准基线模型和最先进的在线学习方法。

Conclusion: 该研究挑战了传统的参数选择方法，并证明了更新潜在因素的特征表示对于解决时间序列预测中的分布偏移问题更有效。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于激光雷达驱动的机器学习框架，用于将室内表面分类为半镜面和低镜面类别，使用光学反射率作为电磁散射行为的代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波和亚太赫兹网络中的可靠连接取决于周围表面的反射，因为高频信号很容易被阻挡。表面的散射行为不仅取决于材料的介电常数，还取决于粗糙度，粗糙度决定了能量是保持在镜面方向还是散射。

Method: 使用从15种代表性室内材料收集的超过78,000个点的数据集，并将其划分为3厘米x3厘米的patch，以实现从部分视图进行分类。提取捕获几何形状和强度的patch级特征，包括仰角、自然对数标度的强度和最大值与平均值之比，并用于训练随机森林、XGBoost和神经网络分类器。

Result: 结果表明，集成树模型始终在准确性和鲁棒性之间提供最佳折衷，证实了激光雷达衍生的特征捕获了粗糙度引起的散射效应。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成散射感知环境地图和数字孪生，支持下一代网络中的自适应波束管理、阻塞恢复和环境感知连接。

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

TL;DR: 本文从博弈论的角度研究了用于将网络划分为不相交社区的 Constant Potts 模型 (CPM)，强调其效率、稳健性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将节点划分为不相交的社区是数据科学中的基本问题之一。

Method: 将 CPM 重新解释为一种潜在的享乐博弈，通过将其全局哈密顿量分解为局部效用函数，其中每个agent的局部效用增益与全局效用的相应增加相匹配。利用这种等价性，证明了通过更好响应动态对 CPM 目标进行局部优化，可以在伪多项式时间内收敛到平衡分区。引入并关联了两个稳定性标准：一个严格的标准，基于鲁棒性的新概念，要求节点同时最大化社区内的邻居和最小化非邻居；以及一个宽松的效用函数，基于这些目标的加权和，由分辨率参数控制。

Result: 在社区跟踪场景中，当初始分区用于使用部分真实信息引导 Leiden 算法时，实验表明，稳健的分区在恢复真实社区方面产生更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 稳健的分区在恢复真实社区方面产生更高的准确性。

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for V2I link quality prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack three-dimensional spatial understanding.

Method: A lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is proposed. A BEV of the environment is constructed by collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles and fused with the ego vehicle's input. A co-simulation environment combining CARLA and MATLAB is developed to generate multimodal data.

Result: The proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved performance across all tasks. The approach improves the macro-average of the accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%, and this performance gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed BEV injection framework enhances MLLMs for V2I link prediction, demonstrating robustness in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

*Justin Kur,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了量化感知训练（QAT）和知识蒸馏（KD）中数据增强（DA）的选择问题，提出了一种新的DA评估指标，该指标通过最大化上下文互信息来选择合适的DA策略，从而提高低比特模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KD和QAT工作主要集中在通过设计更好的KD损失函数或优化QAT的前向和后向传播来提高量化模型的准确性，而忽略了输入转换（如数据增强）的影响。量化感知KD和DA之间的关系尚不明确。

Method: 提出了一种新的指标，该指标根据DA最大化上下文互信息的能力来评估DA，同时确保每个类别的预测平均接近ground truth标签。该方法可以自动对DA进行排序和选择，所需的训练开销极小，并且与任何KD或QAT算法兼容。

Result: 通过广泛的评估表明，使用我们的指标选择DA策略可以显著提高各种模型架构和数据集上的state-of-the-art QAT和KD工作。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的DA选择指标，可以有效提高量化感知训练和知识蒸馏中低比特模型的性能。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于图神经网络的方法MillGNN，用于多变量时间序列预测，该方法学习多个分组尺度的lead-lag依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了多个分组尺度的lead-lag依赖关系，无法捕捉复杂系统中的分层lead-lag效应。

Method: 提出了MillGNN，包含scale-specific lead-lag图学习模块和hierarchical lead-lag消息传递模块。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验结果表明，与16种state-of-the-art方法相比，MillGNN在长期和短期MTS预测方面都表现出优越性。

Conclusion: MillGNN能够综合考虑变量和组的动态和衰减，全面捕捉lead-lag效应。

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 开发一种非侵入性的冠心病诊断方法，以降低医疗支出。

Method: 使用遗传算法选择50个关键尿液肽生物标志物，并基于多层感知器(MLP)神经网络构建模型；使用SMOTE平衡治疗组和对照组；使用分层验证策略训练神经网络。

Result: 该模型达到了95.67%的精确率、敏感性和特异性，F1得分为0.9565，ROC曲线下面积(AUC)为0.9748， Matthews相关系数(MCC)为0.9134， Cohen's kappa系数为0.9131。

Conclusion: 该模型为冠心病提供了一种高度准确且可靠的非侵入性诊断工具。

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and
contributes significantly to annual healthcare expenditures. To develop a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, we designed a model based on a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, trained on 50 key urinary peptide biomarkers
selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising
345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation
strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,
respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results
indicate that the model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive
diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Topotein的蛋白质表示学习框架，该框架使用蛋白质组合复合物（PCC）和拓扑完整感知器网络（TCPNet）进行拓扑深度学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于序列和图的方法无法捕捉蛋白质结构中固有的层次结构。

Method: PCC在多个层次上表示蛋白质，从残基到二级结构到完整蛋白质，同时保留每个层次的几何信息。TCPNet在这些层次结构中采用SE(3)-等变消息传递，从而更有效地捕获多尺度结构模式。

Result: 在四个蛋白质表示学习任务上的大量实验表明，TCPNet始终优于最先进的几何图神经网络。

Conclusion: 该方法在需要理解二级结构排列的任务（如折叠分类）中表现出特别的优势，验证了分层拓扑特征对于蛋白质分析的重要性。

Abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding
structure-function relationships, yet current sequence- and graph-based methods
fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures.
We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to
complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level.
TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

an arbitrary family of functions with finitely many mistakes. We solve a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星组件的故障代价高昂且难以解决，通常需要大量的人力和物力资源。直接在卫星上嵌入用于故障检测的混合人工智能系统可以通过更早地检测来大大减少这种负担。

Method: 采用形式验证工具 Marabou 来验证人工智能算法中使用的神经网络模型的局部鲁棒性。

Result: 量化模型的输入在输出行为变得不稳定之前可以受到多大的扰动，从而提高其在不确定性下的性能方面的可信度。

Conclusion: 使用 Marabou 验证神经网络模型的局部鲁棒性可以提高卫星组件故障检测的可靠性。

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often
requiring significant human and material resources. Embedding a hybrid AI-based
system for fault detection directly in the satellite can greatly reduce this
burden by allowing earlier detection. However, such systems must operate with
extremely high reliability. To ensure this level of dependability, we employ
the formal verification tool Marabou to verify the local robustness of the
neural network models used in the AI-based algorithm. This tool allows us to
quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior
becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its
performance under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种框架，用于研究机器学习模型行为与临床经验学习之间的不一致性，重点关注现代机器学习管道欠规范的影响。通过前列腺癌预后预测案例研究，将临床知识通过约束整合到ML模型中，从而解决这些不一致性，并分析其对模型性能和行为的影响。此外，还探讨了在非生成AI临床风险预测模型中，通过随机实验进行反馈驱动对齐方法的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型在高表现的同时，并不总能捕捉到终端用户需要的模式。例如，模型可能预测癌症阶段与生存期之间存在非单调递减关系，这与临床经验不符。

Method: 通过调查收集临床知识，并将其作为约束整合到ML模型中，从而解决模型行为与临床经验之间的不一致性。此外，还通过随机实验，探讨了在非生成AI临床风险预测模型中，使用反馈驱动对齐方法的可行性。

Result: 结果表明，在不影响性能的前提下，可以将ML模型与临床经验学习对齐。通过提出的方法引出临床医生的模型偏好，约束模型和非约束模型在预测患者方面的差异越大，临床解释的差异就越明显。

Conclusion: 本文的研究表明，将临床知识融入机器学习模型，可以提高模型与临床经验的一致性，并改善模型的临床可解释性。

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 FedQuad 的新联邦学习方法，旨在解决由于客户端数据异构性导致的全局模型泛化问题，尤其是在数据集规模有限且类别不平衡的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在分散模型训练中有效应对了分布式数据和隐私保护等问题，但客户端间的数据异构性给全局模型的泛化带来了挑战，尤其是在数据集规模有限和类别不平衡时。

Method: 该方法通过显式优化客户端内部类内方差最小化和类间方差最大化，从而减少模型聚合对客户端表示的负面影响。FedQuad 最小化相似样本对之间的距离，同时最大化负样本对之间的距离，从而有效地分离共享特征空间中的客户端数据。

Result: 在 CIFAR-10 和 CIFAR-100 数据集上，通过各种数据分布和大量客户端的评估，FedQuad 表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: 本文详细分析了监督学习和联邦学习范式中基于度量学习的策略，强调了它们在解决联邦环境中表示学习挑战方面的有效性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的synthetic data-powered CCI (SP-CCI)框架，以解决反事实结果预测区间构建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CCI方法在处理治疗不平衡时，由于反事实样本稀缺，预测区间过于保守。

Method: 该方法通过预训练的反事实模型生成合成反事实标签来扩充校准集，并结合基于风险控制预测集(RCPS)的conformal calibration过程，以及一个由prediction-powered inference (PPI)驱动的去偏步骤。

Result: SP-CCI在保持边际覆盖率的同时，实现了更紧的预测区间。在不同数据集上的实验结果表明，SP-CCI在所有设置下都能持续减小区间宽度。

Conclusion: SP-CCI 能够有效改进反事实预测区间的构建，尤其是在治疗不平衡的情况下。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习被广泛应用于决策，但算法追索过程中的公平性问题受到关注。

Method: 通过理论分析，将追索和分类中的公平性联系起来，并引入基于社会负担的公平性框架和社会负担最小化算法(MISOB)。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验结果表明，MISOB 可以在不影响分类器准确率的情况下，减少所有群体的社会负担。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一个算法追索中不公平性的整体理论刻画，并提出了一个实用的算法(MISOB)，可以在现实条件下广泛应用，减少社会负担。

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高机器学习任务的性能，生成数据是一种常见的方法，其中之一是训练分类模型。本文提出TAGAL，它可以使用agentic工作流生成合成表格数据。

Method: TAGAL利用大型语言模型(llm)进行自动和迭代的过程，该过程使用反馈来改进生成的数据，而不需要任何进一步的LLM训练。llm的使用还允许在生成过程中添加外部知识。

Result: TAGAL在不同的数据集和生成数据的不同质量方面进行了评估。我们研究了下游机器学习模型的效用，包括仅在合成数据上训练分类器，以及将真实数据和合成数据结合起来。此外，我们比较了真实数据和生成数据之间的相似性。我们表明，TAGAL能够与需要LLM训练的最先进的方法相媲美，并且通常优于其他无训练方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现突出了agentic工作流的潜力，并为基于llm的数据生成方法开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的注意力机制，它将可学习的动态模型直接加入到注意力权重的计算中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的注意力机制直接比较查询和键，而本文将输入序列建模为线性随机微分方程（SDE）的离散观测。

Method: 通过施加一个具有同时对角化状态矩阵和噪声协方差的线性动力学模型，利用微分 Lyapunov 方程的闭式解来有效地传播成对不确定性。注意力自然地产生为该线性 SDE 的最大似然解，其注意力权重对应于传播的成对精度的鲁棒残差重加权。

Result: 通过对状态矩阵的特征值施加额外的约束，可以得到一个简化的变体，该变体具有与标准注意力相同的计算和内存复杂性。在动力学和过程噪声消失的极限情况下，并使用小角度近似，可以恢复普通的点积注意力。

Conclusion: 提出的 AFA 方法是一种新的注意力机制，它将可学习的动态模型直接加入到注意力权重的计算中，并且在计算效率和性能方面都有良好的表现。

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in

underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

Motivation: 之前的研究主要集中在分类模型上，而时间序列预测模型中的MIA影响尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出了两种新的攻击方法：多变量LiRA的改编版本和一种名为深度时间序列（DTS）攻击的端到端学习方法。同时，还将其他领先的分类攻击方法进行了改编。

Result: 时间序列预测模型容易受到攻击，用户级别的攻击通常能实现完美的检测。所提出的方法在多种设置下表现最强，为时间序列预测中的隐私风险评估建立了新的基线。此外，漏洞会随着预测范围的扩大和训练人群的减少而增加。

Conclusion: 时间序列预测模型存在成员推理漏洞，需要进一步研究和缓解。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型在推理时计算和内存成本高昂。

Method: 引入集合块解码（SBD），在单个架构中结合了标准下一个token预测（NTP）和掩码token预测（MATP）。

Result: 在Llama-3.1 8B和Qwen-3 8B上进行微调后，SBD能够在生成所需的forward pass次数减少3-5倍的同时，达到与等效NTP训练相同的性能。

Conclusion: SBD无需架构更改或额外的训练超参数，保持与精确KV缓存的兼容性，并且可以通过微调现有的下一个token预测模型来实现。

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

TL;DR: 提出了ZooCast，一个能够动态选择最佳时间序列基础模型用于不同预测任务的模型动物园。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同的时间序列基础模型在预测不同时间序列时表现出不同的优势，没有一个模型在所有情况下都表现最好。如何利用这些模型的互补能力是一个机会。

Method: 提出了One-Embedding-Fits-All范式，构建了一个统一的表示空间，其中动物园中的每个模型都由一个单一的嵌入表示，从而能够为所有任务进行有效的相似性匹配。

Result: ZooCast在GIFT-Eval零样本预测基准上表现出色，同时保持了单个时间序列基础模型的效率。在具有顺序模型发布的实际场景中，该框架可以无缝添加新模型，以微不足道的开销获得渐进的准确性提升。

Conclusion: ZooCast能够智能地将当前的时间序列基础模型组装成一个模型动物园，并动态地为不同的预测任务选择最佳模型。

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly
adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

*Diede P. M. van der Hoorn,Alessio Arleo,Fernando V. Paulovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种评估降维 (DR) 过程关系阶段的新方法，该方法使用精确率和召回率来量化建模关系与预期集群结构的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 DR 质量指标无法解释为什么预期的结构会丢失。可视化分析解决方案可以提供帮助，但由于超参数空间大，通常很耗时。本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 本文利用一个框架将 DR 过程分为两个阶段：关系阶段和映射阶段。引入了两个监督指标，精确率和召回率，以评估关系阶段。这些指标量化了建模关系与基于某些表示该结构的标签集的预期集群结构的一致性。

Result: 本文通过使用 t-SNE 和 UMAP 说明了该方法的应用，并通过各种使用场景验证了该方法。

Conclusion: 本文的方法可以指导超参数调整，发现投影伪影，并确定预期结构是否在关系中捕获，从而使 DR 过程更快、更可靠。

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.
