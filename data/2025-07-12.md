TL;DR: LLM中的偏差主要受预训练的影响，而不是微调或随机性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）表现出认知偏差，类似于人类的非理性决策的系统性倾向。先前的研究发现，这些偏差因模型而异，并且可以通过指令调整来放大。然而，尚不清楚这些偏差的差异是源于预训练、微调还是甚至是由于训练随机性而产生的随机噪声。

Method: 通过多次使用不同的随机种子对模型进行微调，研究训练随机性如何影响超过30种认知偏差。引入交叉调整，在模型之间交换指令数据集以分离偏差源。

Result: 训练随机性引入了一些可变性，但偏差主要由预训练决定：具有相同预训练骨干的模型比仅共享微调数据的模型表现出更相似的偏差模式。

Conclusion: 预训练对偏差的影响大于微调，在评估和减少LLM中的偏差时，需要考虑其预训练的起源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)
*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs used in surveys are unreliable due to biases and sensitivity to question variations, requiring careful prompt design and testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used as proxies for human subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to known response biases are poorly understood.

Method: Tested nine diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying 11 perturbations to question phrasing and answer option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews.

Result: Revealed LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations, with all tested models exhibiting a consistent recency bias. Larger models are generally more robust but remain sensitive to semantic variations and combined perturbations.

Conclusion: LLMs are vulnerable to perturbations and exhibit a consistent recency bias, favoring the last-presented answer option. Prompt design and robustness testing are crucial when using LLMs for synthetic survey data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthTextEval is a toolkit for comprehensive evaluations of synthetic text, which helps improve the viability of synthetic text and privacy-preservation in AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems in high-stakes domains.

Method: The toolkit allows users to conduct evaluations along multiple dimensions over synthetic data that they upload or generate using the toolkit's generation module.

Result: SynthTextEval allows users to conduct evaluations along all of these dimensions: its utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and qualitative feedback from domain experts.The functionality and effectiveness over datasets from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law are highlighted.

Conclusion: This toolkit aims to improve the viability of synthetic text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces a new safety evaluation protocol for medical LLMs, focusing on patient and clinician perspectives, and establishes a benchmark for safer deployment in medical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general safety benchmarks.

Method: introduction of a safety evaluation protocol tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze the safety of medical LLMs. building the PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure safety from the perspective of the patient. apply red-teaming protocols on the MediPhi model collection as a case study

Result: quantitatively analyze the safety of medical LLMs

Conclusion: This paper defines safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient, clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in medical domains.

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

### [5] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)
*Mariah Bradford,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes interruption detection in multi-group dialogue settings and creates a state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to overlapping speech, which could be deployed in classrooms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need to contend with multiple concurrent conversations where overlapping speech will be ubiquitous.

Method: The study analyzes interruption detection in single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings.

Result: The study highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions.

Conclusion: The study creates a state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to overlapping speech.

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

### [6] [The Cross-Lingual Cost: Retrieval Biases in RAG over Arabic-English Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07543)
*Chen Amiraz,Yaroslav Fyodorov,Elad Haramaty,Zohar Karnin,Liane Lewin-Eytan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了阿拉伯语-英语 RAG，发现检索是跨语言领域特定场景中的一个关键瓶颈，并提出了一种简单的检索策略，通过强制从两种语言中平等检索来解决这个问题，从而显着提高了跨语言和整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言检索增强生成 (RAG) 是一项关键功能，用于跨语言检索和生成答案。 然而，先前的工作主要集中在生成上，并且依赖于源自开放域源（最显着的是维基百科）的基准。 在这样的设置中，由于语言不平衡、与预训练数据的重叠以及记忆内容，检索挑战通常仍然隐藏。

Method: 使用从真实世界的公司数据集导出的基准，在领域特定的设置中研究阿拉伯语-英语 RAG。

Result: 检索是跨语言领域特定场景中的一个关键瓶颈，当用户查询和支持文档的语言不同时，性能会显着下降。 这些失败主要源于检索器难以对跨语言的文档进行排序。 通过强制从两种语言中平等检索，从而解决了这个问题，从而显着提高了跨语言和整体性能。

Conclusion: 检索是跨语言领域特定场景中的一个关键瓶颈，当用户查询和支持文档的语言不同时，性能会显著下降。通过强制从两种语言中平等检索，从而解决了这个问题，从而显着提高了跨语言和整体性能。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework with RAG generates better counterspeech against health misinformation by optimizing knowledge retrieval, evidence, and refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies on using LLMs with RAG for counterspeech against misinformation have limited evidence and control over outputs.

Method: A multi-agent retrieval-augmented framework incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. It integrates both static and dynamic evidence.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy. Ablation studies verify the necessity of each component, and human evaluations show that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality and obtains human preference.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent retrieval-augmented framework effectively generates high-quality counterspeech against health misinformation, outperforming baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy. Human evaluations confirm the significant enhancement of counterspeech quality through refinement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

### [8] [Rethinking the Privacy of Text Embeddings: A Reproducibility Study of "Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07700)
*Dominykas Seputis,Yongkang Li,Karsten Langerak,Serghei Mihailov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Vec2Text可以通过嵌入重建文本，但存在局限性，量化是一种缓解隐私风险的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vec2Text可以通过受控解码从黑盒嵌入中成功地重建原始文本，这对传统观点提出了挑战，即传输嵌入而不是原始文本被认为是保护隐私的。

Method: 重现Vec2Text框架，并从两个角度对其进行评估：(1) 验证原始声明，以及 (2) 通过有针对性的实验扩展研究。

Result: Vec2Text在理想条件下是有效的，能够重建甚至缺乏明确语义的类似密码的序列。但是，我们发现了一些关键的局限性，包括其对输入序列长度的敏感性。我们还发现，高斯噪声和量化技术可以减轻Vec2Text带来的隐私风险，其中量化提供了一种更简单，更广泛适用的解决方案。

Conclusion: 使用文本嵌入需要谨慎，并强调进一步研究NLP系统鲁棒防御机制的重要性。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

*Fardin Rastakhiz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a GNN and CNN model for efficient text classification, outperforming transformers in processing long texts by using graph structures and information from LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical in Deep Learning, especially when processing long texts, and Transformers are inefficient for extended documents due to their quadratic computational complexity.

Method: A novel model architecture combining GNNs and CNNs with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism is introduced. It incorporates information from LLMs and captures local contextual patterns using CNNs and expands receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures.

Result: The generated graphs exhibit structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model demonstrates efficiency and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models on sentiment analysis and news-categorization tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN and CNN model achieves efficient and competitive performance on text classification tasks.

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

TL;DR: MedReadCtrl 是一种可读性控制的指令调优框架，它使大型语言模型 (LLM) 能够在不影响含义的情况下调整输出复杂性，在各种任务中优于 GPT-4，并且专家更喜欢它。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床决策支持到改善结果的面向患者的聊天机器人等方面，生成式人工智能在医疗保健领域表现出了强大的潜力。部署的一个关键挑战是有效的人工智能沟通，其中内容必须既个性化又易于理解。

Method: MedReadCtrl，一个可读性控制的指令调优框架，使 LLM 能够在不影响含义的情况下调整输出复杂性。

Result: 在医疗和通用领域的九个数据集和三个任务的评估表明，MedReadCtrl 的可读性指令遵循错误明显低于 GPT-4（例如，在 ReadMe 上为 1.39 对 1.59，p<0.001），并且在未见过的临床任务中实现了显著的收益（例如，在 MTSamples 上 +14.7 ROUGE-L，+6.18 SARI）。专家们一致更喜欢 MedReadCtrl（71.7% 对 23.3%），尤其是在低文化水平时。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl 能将临床内容重组为可访问的、与可读性一致的语言，同时保留医疗意图，为支持患者教育和扩大 AI 支持的公平医疗服务提供了一个可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

Motivation: 构建可解释的时间序列基础模型。

Method: 使用大型多模态模型生成自然语言注释，并使用这些注释来监督小型 Qwen 模型的微调。

Conclusion: 轻量级的、具备语言能力的模型可以解释时间序列中的时间模式。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in

*Yu Xia,Yiran Jenny Shen,Junda Wu,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Lina Yao,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SAND框架，提高LLM agent的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 代理通常通过对 ReAct 风格的专家轨迹进行监督微调或对成对 rollouts 进行偏好优化来进行调整。这些方法大多侧重于模仿特定的专家行为或提升所选的推理思想和行动而不是被拒绝的推理思想和行动。然而，如果没有对替代行动进行推理和比较，使用这些方法进行微调的 LLM 代理可能会由于有限的行动空间探索而过度投入到看似合理但次优的行动中。

Method: 本文提出了一种自学行动审议 (SAND) 框架，使 LLM 代理能够在提交行动之前明确地考虑候选行动。为了解决在给定大动作空间和步进式动作评估的情况下何时以及审议什么的问题，我们结合了自我一致性动作抽样和执行引导的动作评论，以帮助使用 LLM 代理的基础模型综合步进式动作审议思想。然后以迭代方式，审议轨迹用于微调 LLM 代理本身。

Result: SAND 实现了比初始监督微调平均 20% 的改进，并且优于最先进的代理调整方法。

Conclusion: SAND在两个具有代表性的交互式代理任务上评估，与初始监督微调相比，平均提高了 20%，并且优于最先进的代理调整方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

TL;DR: RLEP是一种用于大型语言模型的强化学习框架，它通过重放高质量的经验来提高训练效率和性能，并在数学问题上取得了显著的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的强化学习(RL)是一项能源密集型的工作：训练可能不稳定，策略可能会逐渐偏离其预训练的权重。

Method: RLEP -- 具有经验重放的强化学习 -- 这是一个两阶段框架，首先收集经过验证的轨迹，然后在后续训练期间重放它们。在每个更新步骤中，策略都在混合了新生成的rollout和这些重放的成功案例的小批量上进行优化。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B基模型上，RLEP以明显更少的更新次数达到了基线峰值精度，并最终超过了它，在AIME-2024上的准确率从38.2%提高到39.9%，在AIME-2025上的准确率从19.8%提高到22.3%，在AMC-2023上的准确率从77.0%提高到82.2%。

Conclusion: RLEP通过重放高质量的成功案例，避免了无效的探索，并将学习集中在有希望的推理路径上，从而实现了更快的收敛和更强的最终性能。在Qwen2.5-Math-7B基模型上，RLEP以更少的更新次数达到了基线峰值精度，并最终超过了它，在AIME-2024上的准确率从38.2%提高到39.9%，在AIME-2025上的准确率从19.8%提高到22.3%，在AMC-2023上的准确率从77.0%提高到82.2%。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our
code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了“机器胡说八道”的概念框架和量化指标，发现模型微调和思维链提示会加剧胡说八道现象，尤其是在政治语境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们提出了机器胡说八道作为一个总体概念框架，该框架可以让研究人员描述法学硕士中涌现出的真实性丧失的更广泛现象，并阐明其潜在机制。

Method: 引入了 Bullshit 指数，这是一种量化法学硕士对真理漠不关心的指标，并提出了一个互补的分类法，分析了四种定性形式的胡说八道：空洞的言辞、含糊其辞、含糊其辞和未经证实的说法。

Result: 使用人类反馈（RLHF）进行强化学习的模型微调显着加剧了胡说八道，并且推理时思维链（CoT）提示显着放大了特定的胡说八道形式，特别是空洞的言辞和含糊其辞。我们还观察到政治语境中普遍存在的机器胡说八道，其中含糊其辞是主要策略。

Conclusion: 模型微调和思维链提示会加剧胡说八道，政治语境中也普遍存在，强调了人工智能对齐方面的系统性挑战，并为更真实的法学硕士行为提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

TL;DR: PLAN-TUNING 通过模仿大型语言模型的规划过程，提高小型语言模型在复杂推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用后训练期间的此类规划结构来提高较小的开源 LLM 的性能仍有待探索。受此启发，我们推出了 PLAN-TUNING。

Method: PLAN-TUNING，一个统一的后训练框架，它 (i) 从大型 LLM 中提取合成任务分解（称为“规划轨迹”），以及 (ii) 通过监督和强化学习目标微调较小的模型，旨在模仿这些规划过程以提高复杂推理。

Result: 在 GSM8k 和 MATH 基准测试中，经过计划调整的模型比强大的基线模型平均高出约 7%。此外，经过计划调整的模型在领域外数据集上表现出更好的泛化能力，在 OlympiadBench 和 AIME 2024 上的性能分别平均提高了约 10% 和约 12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING 是一种有效的策略，可以提高较小 LLM 的特定任务性能。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

TL;DR: TeaR improves LLMs reasoning by guiding them to discover optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of code execution in LLMs leads to over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning structures.

Method: TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks.

Result: TeaR achieves a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

Conclusion: TeaR achieves significant performance improvements on various benchmarks.

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study uses NER and RE with BERT variants to extract ORR catalyst information, achieving high F1-scores with PubMedBERT and MatSciBERT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the complexity and diversity of textual data.

Method: We propose a named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++ with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT, to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature, which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics (FC-CoMIcs).

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of 82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.

Conclusion: The fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of 82.19%, and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%. Domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT for ORR catalyst extraction.

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: understanding the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically hallucinations, and the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform, especially in agentic uses

Method: computational complexity analysis of LLM inference

Result: LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and LLMs are incapable of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity.

Conclusion: LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity.

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于压力增加，对心理支持的需求不断增长，这暴露了相关数据集的稀缺性，尤其是在非英语语言中。

Method: 利用有限的真实世界数据和专家知识来微调两个大型语言模型：对话生成器和对话修改器。

Result: 构建了中文心理支持对话数据集(CPsDD)，包含68K个对话，跨越13个组，16个心理问题，13个原因和12个支持重点。引入了综合代理对话支持系统(CADSS)。

Conclusion: CADSS在CPsDD和ESConv数据集上，在策略预测和情感支持对话(ESC)任务中都取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Motivation: 传统研究主要涉及二元环境，而口语对话的一个基本组成部分是轮流转换。

Method: 将语音活动预测 (VAP) 应用于预测三方多方场景中即将发生的轮流转换。

Result: 在日语三方数据集上训练的多个模型表明，在三方对话中训练的 VAP 优于所有模型的基线，但对话类型会影响准确性。

Conclusion: VAP 可以用于三方对话场景中的轮流转换。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Motivation: To present a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting.

Method: Large language models (LLMs) with carefully designed prompts.

Result: Achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual tracks. The method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset.

Conclusion: LLM-based few-shot learning is effective and adaptable for multilingual sentiment tasks, especially when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent, offering a strong alternative to traditional fine-tuning.

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

TL;DR: SFT and RL have different effects on VLMs, and combining them is difficult.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The joint effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) in VLMs remains uncertain.

Method: Systematic investigation into the roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

Result: SFT improves performance on difficult questions but degrades performance on simpler ones. RL promotes generalization and brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.

Conclusion: Combining SFT and RL for VLMs doesn't produce additive benefits, leading to trade-offs. This highlights the need for more seamless and adaptive approaches.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Motivation: 离散扩散语言模型具有强大的生成能力，但对其内部机制的理解有限。

Method: 通过展示前向掩蔽分布下的预期去噪器输出恢复了干净令牌上的精确后验，从而揭示了离散扩散语言模型的隐藏贝叶斯核心。在最小假设下，对 K 个独立 corruptions 的蒙特卡罗边缘化以 O(1/sqrt(K)) 的速率收敛到这个后验，从而产生一个简单的 consistency 证明和有限样本误差界限。

Result: 在 WikiText-2 上，我们的方法在 K=8 时实现了 8.8 的测试困惑度，而 GPT-2 Small 的困惑度为 20.3，尽管使用了大小相当的模型。

Conclusion: 我们引入了一种轻量级的推理时集成方法，该方法平均 K 个掩码和去噪过程，以获得后验感知令牌概率和不确定性估计，而无需额外的训练成本。在 WikiText-2 上，我们的方法在 K=8 时实现了 8.8 的测试困惑度，而 GPT-2 Small 的困惑度为 20.3，尽管使用了大小相当的模型。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在各种 NLP 任务中表现出了出色的性能，但它们的计算需求阻碍了它们在资源受限的实际环境中的部署。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏压缩 LLM，并评估 Pythia 和 Qwen2.5 系列模型在 SQuAD 和 MLQA 两个 QA 基准上的 zero-shot 和 one-shot prompt 性能。

Result: 学生模型在将参数数量减少高达 57.1% 的同时，保留了 90% 以上的教师模型性能。此外，对于模型系列，one-shot prompt 比 zero-shot 设置产生了额外的性能提升。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏结合少量提示可以产生紧凑但功能强大的 QA 系统，适用于资源受限的应用程序。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

*Abhinav Java,Srivathsan Koundinyan,Nagarajan Natarajan,Amit Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of retrieval searches in RAG. The paper shows that large-scale fine-tuning is not needed and Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help RAG from the perspective of frugality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attempts at improving this approach focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering (QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally important metric, which has received less attention.

Method: A standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts and Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning

Result: Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics, Specifically, a standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks such as HotPotQA.

Conclusion: Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of searches at inference time. For example, the paper shows that the researchers can achieve competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small training cost (1000 examples).

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

### [29] [Lost in Pronunciation: Detecting Chinese Offensive Language Disguised by Phonetic Cloaking Replacement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07640)
*Haotan Guo,Jianfei He,Jiayuan Ma,Hongbin Na,Zimu Wang,Haiyang Zhang,Qi Chen,Wei Wang,Zijing Shi,Tao Shen,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of Chinese phonetic cloaking in online content moderation, introduces a new dataset and taxonomy, and proposes a method to improve detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR) is a major obstacle to Chinese content moderation, and existing evaluations rely on synthetic perturbations that ignore the creativity of real users.

Method: Compilation of a dataset of 500 naturally occurring, phonetically cloaked offensive posts and benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: The best model reaches an F1-score of 0.672 on the dataset, and a Pinyin-based prompting strategy recovers much of the lost accuracy.

Conclusion: This study introduces a taxonomy of Chinese Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), a dataset of real-world PCR posts, reveals the weakness of current detectors, and proposes a mitigation technique.

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决评估摘要质量时需要耗费大量人力生成参考摘要的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的指标NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR)。

Result: NOIR指标可以应用于各种摘要任务，为评估和改进摘要算法、摘要提示和合成生成的摘要提供了一种自动化的工具。

Conclusion: NOIR指标能够有效衡量摘要的质量，并且与人类对摘要质量的感知相关。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Simulated Attention Score (SAS) to improve attention mechanism performance by simulating larger attention heads and feature dimensions with minimal parameter overhead, achieving significant improvements on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of multi-head attention (MHA) improves as the number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains sufficiently large. Increasing both the head count and hidden size per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance gains at a low cost.

Method: The paper introduces Simulated Attention Score (SAS), which simulates a larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a higher-dimensional space. It also extends the simulation approach to key and query embeddings and proposes Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA) to control parameter cost.

Result: The proposed SAS method achieves significant improvements over different attention variants on a variety of datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Simulated Attention Score (SAS) method achieves significant improvements over different attention variants on a variety of datasets and tasks.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

*Hruday Markondapatnaikuni,Basem Suleiman,Abdelkarim Erradi,Shijing Chen*

TL;DR: K2RAG is a new RAG framework that uses vector search, knowledge graphs, and summarization to improve the accuracy, speed, and scalability of question answering with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs to incorporate more knowledge is resource-intensive, and naive RAG implementations have limitations in scalability and answer accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a framework that integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. It also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data.

Result: K2RAG achieved a mean answer similarity score of 0.57 and a Q3 similarity of 0.82. The summarization step reduced training time by 93%, execution speed was up to 40% faster, and VRAM usage was three times less than naive RAG implementations.

Conclusion: K2RAG achieves higher accuracy, efficiency, and scalability compared to naive RAG implementations, demonstrated through experiments on the MultiHopRAG dataset.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Not all tokens contribute equally to model performance in post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs).

Method: Selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability differences between the current policy and a reference model.

Result: Selective-DPO method demonstrates superiority over standard DPO and distillation-based baselines on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench.

Conclusion: Token-level optimization and reference model selection are important in advancing preference alignment for LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Result: Documents progress in task generalization, reasoning formalization, and workflow integration, while also identifying challenges like hallucination and explainability deficits.

Conclusion: This review provides a technical roadmap and conceptual framework for legal AI, highlighting key frontiers like low-resource systems and multimodal evidence integration.

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

*Shoutao Guo,Xiang Li,Shaolei Zhang,Mengge Liu,Wei Chen,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StreamUni通过统一的LSLM和语音CoT实现了StreamST，无需大量策略训练，并在StreamST任务上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的StreamST方法通常在句子级别的语音片段上操作，被称为同步语音翻译（SimulST）。在实践中，它们需要与分割模型协作来完成StreamST，其中截断的语音片段限制了SimulST模型，使其在有限的上下文信息基础上做出策略决策并生成翻译。此外，由于语音输入和跨语言生成的复杂性，SimulST模型难以学习有效的策略。

Method: 我们提出了StreamUni，它通过统一的大型语音语言模型（LSLM）实现StreamST。具体来说，StreamUni结合了语音链式思考（CoT），以指导LSLM生成多阶段输出。

Result: StreamUni同时完成语音分割、策略决策和翻译生成，无需大规模的特定策略训练即可完成StreamST。此外，我们提出了一种流式CoT训练方法，该方法使用有限的CoT数据来增强低延迟策略决策和生成能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在StreamST任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Transformer的解码器模型，用于反转信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入，实验表明该模型能够有效地生成语义上相似的更简单的公式，并应用于需求挖掘任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将符号知识集成到数据驱动的学习算法中。如果这种嵌入在语义上是一致的，即如果相似的规范被映射到附近的向量中，它们可以直接在公式的语义空间中实现连续学习和优化。然而，为了将最优连续表示转换为具体的需求，这种嵌入必须是可逆的。

Method: 训练一个基于Transformer的仅解码器模型，以反转信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入。

Result: 该模型仅在一个epoch后就能够生成有效的公式，并且在大约10个epoch后能够推广到逻辑的语义。

Conclusion: 该模型能够将给定的嵌入解码为公式，这些公式在长度和嵌套方面通常更简单，同时在语义上与黄金参考保持接近（或等效）。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管指令微调非常重要，但很少有人关注所用损失函数的优化。一个基本但经常被忽视的问题是，传统的自回归目标（其中损失仅在响应token上计算，不包括提示token）对于指令微调是否真正最佳。

Method: 系统地研究了在指令微调损失中对提示和响应token进行不同加权的影响，并提出了加权指令微调（WIT）作为传统指令微调的更好替代方案。

Result: 在不同系列和规模的五个语言模型、三个不同规模的微调数据集和五个不同的评估基准上进行了大量实验，结果表明，标准指令微调损失通常会产生次优性能，并且对输入提示变化的鲁棒性有限。

Conclusion: 标准指令微调损失通常会产生次优性能，并且对输入提示变化的鲁棒性有限。对提示token的低到中等权重，加上对响应token的中等到高权重，可以在各种设置中产生性能最佳的模型，并且也可以作为后续偏好对齐训练的更好起点。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve cross-lingual semantic alignment by conditioning target token probabilities on source-language tokens.

Method: The paper introduces conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on source-language tokens from parallel data. A target tokenizer is learned to maximizes cross-lingual semantic alignment given a fixed source tokenizer.

Result: The conditional tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram tokenizers, but results are mixed: no improvements in machine translation quality, but consistent perplexity reductions in language modeling are found.

Conclusion: Conditional unigram tokenization does not improve machine translation quality, and perplexity reductions are observed in language modeling. Quadratic scaling of conditional probability estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency bottleneck, and alternative parameterizations may be necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

TL;DR: Coreference resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering performance in RAG-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that disrupts in-context learning.

Method: Comparative analysis of different pooling strategies in retrieval tasks and question answering tasks.

Result: Mean pooling demonstrates superior context capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. Smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process.

Conclusion: Coreference resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering (QA) performance, especially for smaller models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

Motivation: 现有的对话式健康代理（CHA）是静态且脆弱的，无法进行自适应多轮推理、症状澄清或透明决策，限制了它们在临床诊断中的实际应用。

Method: DocCHA将诊断过程分解为三个阶段：症状启发、病史采集和因果图构建。

Result: DocCHA在诊断准确率上提高了5.18%，在症状召回率上提高了30%以上。

Conclusion: DocCHA在诊断准确率和症状召回率方面优于其他模型，证明了其在临床对话中的有效性。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: preparing high quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone process

Method: an automated pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at
https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract, and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful in real-world scenarios.

Method: introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language models to truly remember. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls and coordinates updates and retrieval.

Result: on ScreenshotVQA, MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%. Second, on LOCOMO, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing existing baselines.

Conclusion: MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents.

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [47] [Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981)
*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IM-RMs generalize worse than EX-RMs because they rely on superficial token-level cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the generalization gap between implicit and explicit reward models (IM-RMs and EX-RMs) in language models.

Method: Theoretical analysis and experiments to investigate the root cause of the generalization gap between IM-RMs and EX-RMs.

Result: IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues, causing poor generalization. Alternative hypotheses were challenged.

Conclusion: IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues, leading to worse generalization than EX-RMs, especially under token-level distribution shifts.

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

Motivation: 现有方法未解决mention歧义和模态内容动态选择的问题。

Method: 提出了一个多层次混合专家(MMoE)模型，包含描述感知mention增强模块、多模态特征提取模块、层内混合专家模块和层间混合专家模块。

Result: 大量实验证明MMoE的性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MMoE在MEL任务上表现出色，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method called Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss (CoPT) for unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation. It leverages domain-agnostic text embeddings generated by an LLM to learn domain-invariant features. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UDA methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic properties of text.

Method: a novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP model and combined.

Result: achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for segmentation on four benchmarks

Conclusion: a model trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for segmentation.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像生成模型 (IGM) 的最新进展，特别是基于扩散的架构（如 Stable Diffusion (SD)），显着提高了 AI 生成视觉内容的质量和多样性。然而，它们的生成能力也引发了重大的伦理、法律和社会问题，包括产生有害、误导或侵犯版权内容的可能性。为了缓解这些问题，机器反学习 (MU) 成为一种有希望的解决方案，通过选择性地从预训练模型中删除不需要的概念。然而，现有的反学习技术的鲁棒性和有效性在很大程度上仍未被探索，尤其是在存在多模态对抗输入的情况下。

Method: 提出 Recall，一种新颖的对抗框架，旨在破坏未学习的 IGMs 的鲁棒性，通过优化对抗图像提示，利用扩散模型的内在多模态调节能力，并以单个语义相关的参考图像为指导。

Result: 在十种最先进的反学习方法和不同的任务中进行的大量实验表明，在对抗有效性、计算效率和与原始文本提示的语义保真度方面，Recall 始终优于现有的基线。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前反学习机制中的关键漏洞，并强调需要更强大的解决方案，以确保生成模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models

supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are

Motivation: 在全球导航卫星系统（GNSS）不可用的环境中，自主海上监视和目标舰船识别对于搜索和救援以及威胁检测等许多应用至关重要。当目标舰船仅通过视觉线索描述且其最后已知位置不可用时，无人驾驶飞行器（UAV）必须仅依靠机载视觉来扫描严格计算约束下的大型搜索区域。

Conclusion: 利用简单的几何原理定位目标。

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的息肉分割方法通常采用编码器-解码器架构，并且一些方法利用多任务框架，该框架结合了诸如分类之类的辅助任务来增强分割性能。但是，这些方法通常需要额外的带标签数据，并且依赖于任务相似性，这会限制其泛化能力。

Method: CL-Polyp，一个对比学习增强的息肉分割网络, MASPP 模块，用于更好的多尺度特征融合, CA 模块，用于融合低级和上采样特征，以改进边界重建。

Result: CL-Polyp 在 Kvasir-SEG 和 CVC-ClinicDB 数据集上，IoU 指标分别提高了 0.011 和 0.020。

Conclusion: CL-Polyp在五个基准数据集上始终优于最先进的方法。在 Kvasir-SEG 和 CVC-ClinicDB 数据集上，IoU 指标分别提高了 0.011 和 0.020，验证了其在临床息肉分割任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过将脑电信号与多层次语义字幕对齐，从而实现脑电图视觉解码的文本介导框架，并在EEGCVPR数据集上取得了state-of-the-art的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从脑信号中解码视觉体验为神经科学和可解释的人工智能提供了令人兴奋的可能性。虽然脑电图易于获取且时间精度高，但其在空间细节上的限制阻碍了图像重建。

Method: 该模型采用基于Transformer的脑电图编码器，通过对比学习将脑电活动映射到多层次语义字幕，并利用投影头检索到的字幕嵌入来调节预训练的潜在扩散模型进行图像生成。

Result: 该文本介导框架在EEGCVPR数据集上产生了最先进的视觉解码效果，并且可以解释地对齐到已知的神经认知通路。显着的脑电图-字幕关联反映了从感知图像中提取的不同语义水平的重要性。显着图和t-SNE投影揭示了头皮上的语义地形。

Conclusion: 该模型通过结构化的语义中介，实现了与认知对齐的脑电图视觉解码。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 32 video generation papers, identifies key components and strategies for generating long-form videos with multiple characters and narrative coherence, and creates a taxonomy of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16 seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16 seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity detail.

Method: We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield these qualities.

Result: None

Conclusion: We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their architectural designs and performance characteristics.

*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight color-based method (CSCI) for clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) that achieves improved performance without additional supervision by disentangling color bias from identity features using S2A self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CC-ReID methods are resource-intensive due to their reliance on additional models or annotations. This paper explores color as a lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID models.

Method: The paper proposes Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that leverages color information and introduces S2A self-attention to disentangle color-related appearance bias from identity-relevant ReID features.

Result: The paper improves the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in CC-ReID, achieving improved performance on image and video ReID datasets without additional supervision.

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying individuals across a diverse set of activities is challenging because identity cues become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations. Additional visual data like pose and/or silhouette often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.

Method: The paper introduces DisenQ (Disentangling Q-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured language guidance.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three activity-based video benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization to complex real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal language-guided framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on activity-based video benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization to complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: LinguaMark, a new multilingual VQA benchmark, reveals biases in LMMs and highlights Qwen2.5's strong multilingual performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs have limited linguistic coverage, leading to biased outputs across languages. Prior work lacks emphasis on assessing multilingual capabilities.

Method: Introduce LinguaMark, a multilingual VQA benchmark with 6,875 image-text pairs in 11 languages and five social attributes. Evaluate models using Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness.

Result: Closed-source models achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source and open-source models perform competitively across social attributes, with Qwen2.5 generalizing well across languages.

Conclusion: Closed-source LMMs generally perform best, with Qwen2.5 showing strong multilingual generalization across social attributes.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Conclusion: MagiC provides comprehensive analyses that reveal key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

TL;DR: 我们引入了一种自动数据集创建方法 ADIEE，然后使用它来训练指令引导图像编辑评估的评分模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令引导的图像编辑的最新进展强调了有效自动评估的必要性。虽然视觉语言模型 (VLM) 已被用作评估器，但开源模型难以对齐，而专有模型缺乏透明度和成本效益。此外，不存在用于微调开源 VLM 的公共训练数据集，只有具有不同评估方案的小型基准。

Method: 我们生成了一个包含超过 10 万个样本的大规模数据集，并使用它来微调一个 LLaVA-NeXT-8B 模型，该模型经过修改，可以从自定义令牌中解码数字分数。

Result: 由此产生的评分器在所有基准测试中均优于所有开源 VLM 和 Gemini-Pro 1.5，在 AURORA-Bench 上，评分与人类评分的相关性提高了 0.0696 (+17.24%)，在 GenAI-Bench 上，成对比较准确率提高了 4.03% (+7.21%)，在 AURORA-Bench 上，成对比较准确率提高了 4.75% (+9.35%)，与最先进水平相比。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一个评分器，它可以作为一个奖励模型，从而实现自动最佳编辑选择和模型微调。值得注意的是，所提出的评分器可以将 MagicBrush 模型的 ImagenHub 平均评估分数从 5.90 提高到 6.43 (+8.98%)。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉故事讲述系统难以维持跨帧的角色和物体识别，导致不一致的引用和指代幻觉，因为模型缺乏在跨帧建立实体连接方面的明确训练。

Method: 提出了一种对比强化学习方法，训练模型区分连贯的图像序列和来自无关图像的故事。使用双组件奖励函数的直接偏好优化，促进实体在真实故事中的 grounding 和重新识别，同时惩罚合成上下文中不正确的实体连接。

Result: grounding mAP 从 0.27 提升到 0.31 (+14.8%)，F1 值从 0.35 提升到 0.41 (+17.1%)。代词 grounding 准确率提高，跨帧角色和物体持久性增加，出现在 5 个或更多帧中的实体从 29.3% 提升到 33.3% (+13.7%)。结构良好的故事从 79.1% 增加到 97.5% (+23.3%)。

Conclusion: 使用对比框架微调 Qwen Storyteller 模型，在多个指标上取得了显著提升，包括 grounding mAP、F1 值、代词 grounding 准确率、跨帧角色和物体持久性以及故事结构。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing particle-based shape modeling methods lack self-adaptivity, which is essential for accurately representing complex anatomical variability.

Method: This paper introduces a novel neighborhood correspondence loss and a geodesic correspondence algorithm.

Result: The approach's efficacy and scalability are evaluated on challenging datasets, with a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and correspondence metrics.

Conclusion: This paper introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. The approach's efficacy and scalability are evaluated on challenging datasets, with a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and benchmarking against existing methods.

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and

multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动迁移方法忽略了动物的独特习惯行为，而动物运动体现了特定物种的行为习惯，因此需要一种能够保持习惯行为的跨类别动物运动迁移框架。

Method: 提出了一种新的习惯保持运动迁移框架，该框架具有类别特定的习惯编码器，并结合了大型语言模型（LLM）。

Result: 通过在DeformingThings4D-skl数据集上进行的大量实验和定量分析验证了该模型的优越性。

Conclusion: 该模型在跨类别动物运动迁移方面表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can

completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve

Conclusion: The proposed EPIC method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer trainable parameters compared to other fine-tuning strategies, and demonstrates superior or comparable performance on the UPMC-Food101, SNLI-VE, and MM-IMDB datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and

diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FIR models lack dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations, leading to distorted facial textures and structures.

Method: A novel GAN-based blind FIR framework integrating local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE).

Result: The proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods and enhances structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods, especially in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing facial structures. The SFFT and DAFE modules enhance structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

Method: 提出了一种新的生成框架，用于生成时间不可学习的示例 (TUE)，其高效的计算使其可扩展到大规模视频数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法在视频数据隐私保护方面取得了最先进的性能，并在 VOT 模型、数据集和时间匹配任务中具有强大的可迁移性。

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: improving the models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking optimization.

Method: Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion models by minimizing reverse KL divergence

Result: diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in PickScore across all evaluation datasets

Conclusion: DMPO unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

*Shuaijin Wan,Huaijiang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GGMotion通过对人体拓扑进行分组建模，并利用动力学和运动学先验知识，在短期运动预测方面取得了显著的性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人体姿势表示为抽象的图结构，忽略了关节之间内在的物理依赖性，这增加了学习难度，并使模型容易产生不真实的运动。

Method: 提出了一种新的组图动力学-运动学网络GGMotion，该网络以分组方式对人体拓扑进行建模，以更好地利用动力学和运动学先验知识。提出了一个新的径向场来捕获更全面的时空依赖性，并通过空间和时间边缘聚合关节特征。采用组间和组内交互模块来捕获不同尺度的关节依赖性。结合等变多层感知器（MLP），通过并行动力学-运动学传播更新每个组中的关节位置特征，以提高物理合理性。引入辅助损失来监督训练期间的运动先验。

Result: 在Human3.6M、CMU-Mocap和3DPW三个标准基准数据集上进行了大量实验，证明了该方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: GGMotion在三个标准数据集上表现出色，在短期运动预测方面取得了显著的性能优势。

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于动态场景物体分割的多视角视频数据集MUVOD，包含丰富的标注和基准，旨在促进该领域的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景的4D物体分割由于缺乏足够广泛和准确标记的多视角视频数据集，仍然是一个未被充分探索的领域。

Method: 收集来自不同类型相机装备的数据集，包含至少9个视角和最多46个视角，提供7830张RGB图像及其对应的4D运动分割掩码。

Result: MUVOD数据集包含459个实例，共73个类别，提供了一个评估多视角视频分割方法的基本基准。同时提出了评估指标和一个基线分割方法。针对3D物体分割任务，提供了一个包含50个物体的多视角图像子集。

Conclusion: 提出了一个新的多视角视频数据集MUVOD，用于训练和评估重建的真实场景中的物体分割，并为3D物体分割任务提出了一个新的基准。

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

*Mingyang Song,Yang Zhang,Marko Mihajlovic,Siyu Tang,Markus Gross,Tunç Ozan Aydın*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的样条曲线轨迹表示方法，该方法在时间插值和动态场景重建方面优于现有技术，同时增强了运动连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集点轨迹建模通常采用隐式变形场，表示为将坐标映射为关联规范空间位置到时间偏移的神经网络。然而，神经网络中固有的归纳偏差会阻碍不适定场景中的空间连贯性。当前的方法要么侧重于增强变形场的编码策略，但通常会导致不透明且不太直观的模型，要么采用显式技术，如线性混合蒙皮，这依赖于基于启发式的结点初始化。此外，隐式表示在插值稀疏时间信号方面的潜力仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于样条的轨迹表示，其中结点的数量明确地决定了自由度。为了在空间和时间域中对结点特征进行建模，我们引入了一种新的低秩时变空间编码，取代了传统的耦合时空技术。

Result: 我们的方法在时间插值方面表现出卓越的性能，适用于拟合具有稀疏输入的连续场。此外，与最先进的方法相比，它实现了具有竞争力的动态场景重建质量，同时增强了运动连贯性，且不依赖于线性混合蒙皮或尽可能刚性的约束。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种基于样条的轨迹表示方法，该方法优于当前方法，同时增强了运动连贯性，且不依赖于线性混合蒙皮或尽可能刚性的约束。

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

*Joelle Hanna,Linus Scheibenreif,Damian Borth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPEX, a mixture-of-modality experts remote sensing foundation model, addresses the modality mismatch and high fine-tuning costs of existing models by using modality-conditioned token routing and modality aware pruning. It achieves strong performance on diverse remote sensing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: a mismatch between the application modalities and the pre-training data in existing remote sensing foundation models, and the large size of foundation models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small datasets for each task

Method: a remote sensing foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts, pre-trained on multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing mechanism and a modality aware pruning technique

Result: efficient modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the modalities of interest

Conclusion: MAPEX demonstrates strong performance on diverse remote sensing datasets compared to fully supervised training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

### [90] [Beyond the Linear Separability Ceiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07574)
*Enrico Vompa,Tanel Tammet,Mohit Vaishnav*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs are limited by the linear separability of their visual embeddings. This work finds this bottleneck stems from failures in the language model's reasoning pathways and demonstrates this is a solvable alignment issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks. This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck".

Method: Introducing the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings.

Result: The bottleneck is widespread and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's reasoning pathways. Activating existing pathways suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires adapting core model weights. Strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.

Conclusion: Robust reasoning in VLMs is a matter of targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

*Chunyan Wang,Dong Zhang,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGKD-WLSS通过结合扩散引导的知识蒸馏和深度引导的特征融合，解决了弱监督低光照语义分割中的图像质量下降和弱监督约束问题，并在该任务中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在光照良好的情况下取得了显著的进展，但在低光照环境中，由于图像质量严重下降（例如，低对比度、噪声和颜色失真）以及弱监督的固有约束，其性能显著下降。这些因素共同导致了不可靠的类激活图和语义模糊的伪标签，最终损害了模型学习区分性特征表示的能力。

Method: 结合了Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation (DGKD) 和 Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2)。DGKD通过基于扩散的去噪和知识蒸馏对齐正常光和低光特征，而DGF2集成了深度图作为光照不变的几何先验来增强结构特征学习。

Result: DGKD-WLSS在弱监督的低光照语义分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS在弱监督的低光照语义分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables
effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension
constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture
supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly
enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering
and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the
MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of
97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other
recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect

TL;DR: HOTA是一种新的推理策略，可以生成准确、大范围的3D洪水地图，适用于快速灾害响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水是最常见的自然灾害之一，会造成重大的社会和经济损失。及时、大规模的洪水范围和深度信息对于灾害响应至关重要；然而，现有的产品通常以空间细节换取覆盖范围，或者完全忽略洪水深度。

Method: HOTA：分层重叠平铺聚合，一种即插即用的多尺度推理策略。结合SegFormer和一个双约束深度估计模块，形成一个完整的3D洪水mapping管道。

Result: 案例研究表明，当与SegFormer结合使用时，HOTA将IoU从73%（U-Net基线）提高到84%。由此产生的3D表面实现了小于0.5米的平均绝对边界误差。

Conclusion: HOTA可以生成准确的大面积3D洪水地图，适用于快速灾害响应。

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair

training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal

Result: Evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, and also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition, displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone.

Conclusion: State-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

<details>

Motivation: 视觉-语言模型(vlm)的可靠不确定性量化(UQ)和失败预测仍然是开放的挑战。

Method: ViLU通过整合视觉嵌入、预测的文本嵌入和图像条件文本表示，构建了一个不确定性感知多模态表示。不同于传统的基于损失预测的不确定性量化方法，ViLU训练一个不确定性预测器作为二元分类器，以区分正确和不正确的预测。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k等标准分类数据集以及CC12M和LAION-400M等大规模图像字幕数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法与最先进的失败预测方法相比，有显著的提高。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的视觉-语言不确定性量化框架ViLU，并在各种数据集上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明该方法优于目前最好的失败预测方法。

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

TL;DR: 提出了一种轨迹引导的生成视频编码框架(T-GVC)，该框架在超低比特率条件下优于传统编解码器和最先进的端到端视频压缩方法，并且比现有的文本引导方法实现了更精确的运动控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数现有方法受到领域特异性（例如，面部或人体视频）或过度依赖高级文本指导的限制，这通常无法捕捉运动细节，并导致不切实际的重建。

Method: 提出了一种轨迹引导的生成视频编码框架(T-GVC)。T-GVC采用语义感知的稀疏运动采样管道，通过提取像素级的运动作为稀疏轨迹点，有效地将低层次的运动跟踪与高层次的语义理解联系起来，不仅显著降低了比特率，而且保留了关键的时间语义信息。此外，通过将轨迹对齐的损失约束纳入扩散过程，我们引入了一种免训练的潜在空间引导机制，以确保物理上合理的运动模式，而不牺牲生成模型的固有能力。

Result: 该框架在超低比特率条件下优于传统编解码器和最先进的端到端视频压缩方法。此外，其他实验证实，该方法比现有的文本引导方法实现了更精确的运动控制。

Conclusion: 该框架在超低比特率条件下优于传统编解码器和最先进的端到端视频压缩方法，并且比现有的文本引导方法实现了更精确的运动控制，为几何运动建模引导的生成视频编码开辟了一个新的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems often exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can compromise their fairness and reliability.

Method: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss

Result: Consistent improvements in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age group.

Conclusion: Age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Conclusion: MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5% in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate estimation of growth potential in pediatric orthodontics is essential for developing effective treatment strategies, but manual annotation of keypoints on cervical vertebrae is labor-intensive.

Method: The study uses Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a user-interactive, deep learning-based model, to analyze cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) features from lateral cephalometric radiographs.

Result: ARNet substantially reduces manual effort in keypoint identification, enhancing efficiency and accuracy, and demonstrates remarkable performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: This research introduces an effective AI-assisted diagnostic tool (ARNet) for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous DFER research has focused on feature learning from a deep learning perspective, but this paper aims to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling by incorporating AU-expression knowledge.

Method: An AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition architecture (AU-DFER) is introduced, incorporating AU-expression knowledge to enhance deep learning modeling. A weight matrix quantifies the contribution of Action Units (AUs) to different expressions, and AU loss integrates this knowledge with the learning outcomes of a conventional deep learning network.

Result: Experiments on mainstream DFER datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods without additional arithmetic. The research also investigates the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance issues.

Conclusion: The proposed AU-DFER architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) and addresses data imbalance issues through AU loss function redesign.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

Motivation: 现有的LVLM在CoT推理中经常忽略生成的理由的内容。

Method: 提出了一种新的即插即用推理时解码策略，称为理由增强解码 (RED)，它通过将不同的图像条件和理由条件下的下一个token分布相乘来协调视觉和理由信息。

Result: RED在多个基准测试和LVLM上持续且显著地提高了推理能力。

Conclusion: RED显著提升了LVLM在多个基准测试和模型上的推理能力，为更可靠的基于理由的多模态系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control.

Method: A unified agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control within a single architecture. Finite State Machines (FSMs) are adopted as interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.

Result: GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path success within five reprompts in Case Study 1. In Case Study 2, the LLM-based controller attains similar performance compared to classical PID control, while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling nonlinear dynamics.

Conclusion: LLMs can unify high-level symbolic planning and low-level continuous control with structured feedback and modular agents, paving the way towards resilient, language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

Motivation: AI 中的普遍偏见问题对绘画分类提出了重大挑战，并且随着这些系统越来越融入艺术策展和修复等任务，情况变得越来越严重。偏差通常源于某些艺术风格占主导地位的不平衡数据集，会损害模型预测的公平性和准确性，即分类器在很少见的绘画上的准确性较低。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的 OOD 感知模型偏见自适应采样方法，称为 BOOST（面向偏见的 OOD 采样和调整）。它通过动态调整温度缩放和采样概率来解决这些挑战，从而促进所有类别的更公平表示。

Result: 在 KaoKore 和 PACS 数据集上评估了该方法，重点关注模型减少类间偏差的能力。此外，还提出了一种新的指标，即同数据集 OOD 检测评分 (SODC)，旨在评估类间分离和每类偏差减少。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了模型在艺术领域中消除偏见的能力，实现了高性能和公平性之间的平衡。

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

Motivation: Traditional machine learning techniques require large training datasets, but illicit supply chains are characterized by sparse, corrupted, or unreliable data. The paper aims to automatically detect new patterns that correlate with illegal activity over complex data without requiring large training datasets.

Method: The paper explores neurosymbolic methods and a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to identify and quantify the relevance of articles.

Result: The paper compares the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities.

Conclusion: This paper proposes a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to identify and quantify the relevance of articles, enabling a systematic evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

operating in that environment, of which, the idea of expert exploration is
investigated in this work. More specifically, this work investigates the
application of large-language models as expert planners for efficient
exploration in planning based tasks for multiple agents.

TL;DR: ViDove是一种多模态翻译agent系统，它利用视觉信息和上下文来提高翻译质量，并在字幕生成和通用翻译任务中优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的翻译agent在处理更长、更复杂的上下文时，已经实现了高度类似人类的翻译结果，并且效率更高。然而，它们通常仅限于纯文本输入。

Method: ViDove利用视觉和上下文背景信息来增强翻译过程，并整合了多模态记忆系统和富含领域知识的长短期记忆模块。

Result: ViDove的翻译质量显著提高，BLEU分数提高了28%，SubER提高了15%。

Conclusion: ViDove在字幕生成和通用翻译任务中实现了显著更高的翻译质量，BLEU 分数提高了 28%，SubER 提高了 15%。

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）的潜在误用，即生成有害内容。关注对齐挑战，重点是防止生成不安全信息的过滤器。

Method: 论证了 prompt 过滤和输出过滤在计算上的挑战，并形式化和研究了宽松的缓解方法。

Result: 表明存在 LLM，对于这些 LLM，不存在有效的 prompt 过滤器：可以很容易地构建引发有害行为的对抗性 prompt，这些 prompt 在计算上与任何有效过滤器的良性 prompt 无法区分。在输出过滤在计算上难以处理的自然环境中识别。

Conclusion: 安全性无法通过设计 LLM 内部结构（架构和权重）外部的过滤器来实现；特别是，对 LLM 的黑盒访问是不够的。对齐的 AI 系统的智能无法与其判断分离。

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization

Method: DrugMCTS，一个新颖的框架，结合了RAG、多智能体协作和蒙特卡洛树搜索用于药物重定向。

Result: DrugMCTS在DrugBank和KIBA数据集上实现了明显更高的召回率和鲁棒性，优于通用LLM和深度学习基线。在不需要领域特定微调的情况下，DrugMCTS使Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct的性能超过Deepseek-R1 20%。

Conclusion: DrugMCTS通过结构化推理、基于代理的协作和反馈驱动的搜索机制，显著提升了LLM在药物发现中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

Conclusion: StarDojo aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used

Result: Context Pooling achieves state-of-the-art performance in 42 out of 48 settings on three public transductive and inductive datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Context Pooling method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 42 out of 48 settings on three public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing GNN-based models for link prediction in KGs.

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在几何和空间推理的能力。

Method: 提出了 PlanQA，一个用于评估大型语言模型中几何和空间推理的诊断基准。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在模拟物理约束、保持空间连贯性或在布局扰动下泛化方面常常失败，无法始终如一地推理现实世界的布局。

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO虽然在实践中取得了成功，但其理论性质和内在局限性仍未得到充分探索。DPO对初始化非常敏感，并且倾向于错误分配概率质量，从而可能无意中加强模型偏差，损害模型对齐的稳定性和与预期偏好的一致性。

Method: 提出了一个理论上有根据的双层优化框架，将监督微调与增强的DPO目标（即稳定偏好优化）紧密结合。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理和总结基准测试中，该方法始终提高了推理准确性，并使输出分布与预期偏好更好地对齐，优于标准DPO。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的基于偏好的对齐目标设计方法，并通过实验验证了其在推理准确性和输出分布对齐方面的优越性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

*Philémon Beghin,Anne-Emmanuelle Ceulemans,François Glineur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or non-reduced based on their contour lines. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to be the most predictive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e. lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.

Method: extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre. Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y = alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta) and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.

Result: distinguishing between reduced and non reduced instruments is feasible to some degree and the opening parameter beta to be the most predictive.

Conclusion: Distinguishing between reduced and non reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to be the most predictive.

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

### [125] [MoSE: Skill-by-Skill Mixture-of-Expert Learning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07818)
*Lu Xu,Jiaqian Yu,Xiongfeng Peng,Yiwei Chen,Weiming Li,Jaewook Yoo,Sunghyun Chunag,Dongwook Lee,Daehyun Ji,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoSE, a skill-oriented MoE model for autonomous driving, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significantly smaller model size by mimicking human driving skills and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization. The paper is inspired by the learning process of human drivers to address these challenges in end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

Method: The paper proposes a skill-oriented Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model (MoSE) with a skill-oriented routing mechanism and a hierarchical skill dataset to mimic human drivers' learning process and reasoning process skill-by-skill and step-by-step. The model is pretrained to encourage step-by-step thinking and integrates auxiliary tasks in a single forward process.

Result: The MoSE model outperforms several 8B+ parameter models on the CODA AD corner case reasoning task with less than 3B sparsely activated parameters and achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by 62.5%) compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MoSE model achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced activated model size on the CODA AD corner case reasoning task, outperforming several 8B+ parameter models with less than 3B sparsely activated parameters.

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes adaptive sensing to improve AI efficiency, sustainability, and equity by modulating sensor parameters at the input level, drawing inspiration from biological sensory systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI advances rely on scaling neural models, incurring environmental, economic, and ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access.

Method: The paper proposes adaptive sensing, inspired by biological sensory systems, to proactively modulate sensor parameters at the input level.

Result: Adaptive sensing enables small models to surpass substantially larger models trained with significantly more data and compute.

Conclusion: This paper advocates for adaptive sensing as a foundational shift towards sustainable, robust, and equitable AI systems. It outlines a roadmap for integration into real-world applications, assesses challenges, and proposes research directions.

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多项式复杂度的算法，用于识别各种系统中实际原因，精度和完备性可调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的XAI和因果关系文献侧重于理解哪些因素导致哪些结果。虽然这些知识对研究人员和工程师很有价值，但它不是非专业用户所期望的解释。相反，这些用户通常等待导致目标结果的事实，即实际原因。形式化这个概念仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。此外，据报道，识别实际原因是一个NP完全问题，并且几乎没有实用的解决方案来近似正式定义。

Method: 提出了一组算法来识别实际原因。

Result: 这些算法可以识别现有方法无法处理的不同类别的系统的原因（即，非布尔、黑盒和随机系统），（2）可以调整以通过更多的计算时间获得更高的精度和完备性。

Conclusion: 提出了一组算法，用于识别具有多项式复杂度和可调整的精度和完备性水平的实际原因。

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

Motivation: 少数公司的人工智能系统在过去十年中实现了令人难以置信的扩展，导致人工智能模型性能的不平等。本文认为，与流行的直觉相反，计算扩展的收益递减将导致人工智能模型能力的收敛。

Method: 我们建立了一个模型，说明在固定分布的下一个token目标下，原始计算的边际能力回报会大幅缩减。我们利用基准数据和理论性能模型提供的证据，给出了训练损失差异等代理指标能够捕捉重要能力指标的几个原因。此外，我们还分析了人工智能模型的能力差异随时间变化的经验数据。

Conclusion: 由于小型模型的能力不断增强，人工智能战略和政策需要重新审视，并且概述了这种转变将影响的领域。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Motivation: 理解 AI 对经济的影响是社会最重要的问题之一。这项工作旨在通过分析人们使用 AI 进行的工作活动、这些活动成功和广泛的程度，并结合有关职业 выполняют 这些活动的数据，朝着这个目标迈出一步。

Method: 分析了 20 万用户与 Microsoft Bing Copilot 之间的匿名和隐私清理对话数据集，这是一个公开可用的生成式 AI 系统。

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

Motivation: 学习基数估计器在查询基数预测中显示出希望，但它们普遍表现出对训练数据漂移的脆弱性，从而给实际部署带来风险。

Method: 提出了一种在黑盒设置中针对学习型估计器的数据中心算法复杂性攻击，并证明了找到最佳攻击策略是 NP-Hard 问题。为了解决这个问题，我们设计了一种具有 (1-κ) 近似比的多项式时间近似算法。

Result: 在 STATS-CEB 和 IMDB-JOB 基准测试中，仅修改 0.8% 的训练元组就会使第 90 个百分位 Qerror 增加三个数量级，并使端到端处理时间最多增加 20 倍。

Conclusion: 揭示了已部署的学习型估计器的关键漏洞，并首次对数据更新下其脆弱性的最坏情况进行了统一的理论分析。此外，我们确定了两种缓解此类黑盒攻击的对策，为开发稳健的学习型数据库优化器提供了见解。

Abstract: Learned cardinality estimators show promise in query cardinality prediction,
yet they universally exhibit fragility to training data drifts, posing risks
for real-world deployment. This work is the first to theoretical investigate
how minimal data-level drifts can maximally degrade the accuracy of learned
estimators. We propose data-centric algorithmic complexity attacks against
learned estimators in a black-box setting, proving that finding the optimal
attack strategy is NP-Hard. To address this, we design a polynomial-time
approximation algorithm with a $(1-\kappa)$ approximation ratio. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our attack's effectiveness: on STATS-CEB and IMDB-JOB
benchmarks, modifying just 0.8\% of training tuples increases the 90th
percentile Qerror by three orders of magnitude and raises end-to-end processing
time by up to 20$\times$. Our work not only reveals critical vulnerabilities in
deployed learned estimators but also provides the first unified worst-case
theoretical analysis of their fragility under data updates. Additionally, we
identify two countermeasures to mitigate such black-box attacks, offering
insights for developing robust learned database optimizers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JOB-Complex, a new benchmark that reflects real-world complexity, to evaluate query optimizers. The results show that existing optimizers struggle on JOB-Complex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are inherently limited, as they do not reflect many real-world properties of query optimization, thus overstating the performance of both traditional and learned optimizers.

Method: Introduce JOB-Complex, a new benchmark designed to challenge traditional and learned query optimizers by reflecting real-world complexity. Overall, JOB-Complex contains 30 SQL queries and comes together with a plan-selection benchmark containing nearly 6000 execution plans

Result: Traditional and learned cost models struggle to achieve high performance on JOB-Complex, providing a runtime of up to 11x slower compared to the optimal plans.

Conclusion: Existing query optimizers struggle to achieve high performance on JOB-Complex, with runtimes up to 11x slower compared to optimal plans.

Abstract: Query optimization is a fundamental task in database systems that is crucial
to providing high performance. To evaluate learned and traditional optimizer's
performance, several benchmarks, such as the widely used JOB benchmark, are
used. However, in this paper, we argue that existing benchmarks are inherently
limited, as they do not reflect many real-world properties of query
optimization, thus overstating the performance of both traditional and learned
optimizers. In fact, simple but realistic properties, such as joins over string
columns or complex filter predicates, can drastically reduce the performance of
existing query optimizers. Thus, we introduce JOB-Complex, a new benchmark
designed to challenge traditional and learned query optimizers by reflecting
real-world complexity. Overall, JOB-Complex contains 30 SQL queries and comes
together with a plan-selection benchmark containing nearly 6000 execution
plans, making it a valuable resource to evaluate the performance of query
optimizers and cost models in real-world scenarios. In our evaluation, we show
that traditional and learned cost models struggle to achieve high performance
on JOB-Complex, providing a runtime of up to 11x slower compared to the optimal
plans.

Abstract: Dataspaces are designed to support sovereign, trusted and decentralized data
exchange between participants forming an ecosystem. They are standardized by
initiatives such as the International Data Spaces Association or Gaia-X and
have gained adoption in several domains such as mobility, manufacturing,
tourism or culture. In dataspaces, participants use connectors to communicate
peer-to-peer. The Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC) Connector is a broadly
adopted, open-source implementation that adheres to the standards and is
supported by a large community. As dataspaces in general, it focuses on the
exchange of data assets with associated usage policies and does not support
services. In practice, however, there is demand for dataspace-based services
and conceptual arguments support their inclusion in dataspaces. In this paper,
we propose an abstraction layer for providing generic services within
dataspaces. Adopters can use this layer to easily develop own services,
seamlessly integrated with the existing dataspace technology. Besides, we
present an initial implementation of this service architecture for the EDC
Connector and demonstrate its practical applicability.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces an LLM-enhanced movie recommendation framework that outperforms traditional methods by incorporating user preferences expressed in natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommendation algorithms lack the ability to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences expressed through text.

Method: Leveraging LLMs to refine traditional algorithm outputs (SVD and SVD++) and integrating them with language-based user preference inputs. Implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset.

Result: The LLM-enhanced framework demonstrates significant improvements over SVD and SVD++ in cumulative hit rate (up to ~6x) and NDCG (up to ~3.7x), with a slight increase in computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-enhanced framework significantly outperforms traditional SVD and SVD++ algorithms in movie recommendation, achieving substantial improvements in various evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide
personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,
e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural
language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework
that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge
of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation
systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with
language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,
implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the
MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base
algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit
rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our
framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use
rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test
split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on
users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more
personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly
surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of
up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a
slight increase in computational overhead.

TL;DR: GCL makes recommender systems more vulnerable to promotion attacks due to spectral smoothing. CLeaR is proposed to amplify this vulnerability, and SIM is proposed to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: integration of GCL inadvertently increases the susceptibility of a recommender to targeted promotion attacks

Method: a bi-level optimization attack method that deliberately amplifies spectral smoothness

Result: GCL increases the susceptibility of a recommender to targeted promotion attacks. CLeaR amplifies spectral smoothness. SIM effectively mitigates these vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: GCL-based recommendation models exhibit greater susceptibility when evaluated with CLeaR, while SIM effectively mitigates these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has demonstrated substantial promise in
enhancing the robustness and generalization of recommender systems,
particularly by enabling models to leverage large-scale unlabeled data for
improved representation learning. However, in this paper, we reveal an
unexpected vulnerability: the integration of GCL inadvertently increases the
susceptibility of a recommender to targeted promotion attacks. Through both
theoretical investigation and empirical validation, we identify the root cause
as the spectral smoothing effect induced by contrastive optimization, which
disperses item embeddings across the representation space and unintentionally
enhances the exposure of target items. Building on this insight, we introduce
CLeaR, a bi-level optimization attack method that deliberately amplifies
spectral smoothness, enabling a systematic investigation of the susceptibility
of GCL-based recommendation models to targeted promotion attacks. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for robust countermeasures; in response, we further
propose SIM, a spectral irregularity mitigation framework designed to
accurately detect and suppress targeted items without compromising model
performance. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that, compared to existing targeted promotion attacks, GCL-based recommendation
models exhibit greater susceptibility when evaluated with CLeaR, while SIM
effectively mitigates these vulnerabilities.

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，NLGCL 在有效性和效率方面优于最先进的基线。

Conclusion: NLGCL在有效性和效率方面优于最先进的基线。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in collaborative filtering to
capture high-order user-item relationships. To address the data sparsity
problem in recommendation systems, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged
as a promising paradigm that maximizes mutual information between contrastive
views. However, existing GCL methods rely on augmentation techniques that
introduce semantically irrelevant noise and incur significant computational and
storage costs, limiting effectiveness and efficiency.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose NLGCL, a novel contrastive learning
framework that leverages naturally contrastive views between neighbor layers
within GNNs. By treating each node and its neighbors in the next layer as
positive pairs, and other nodes as negatives, NLGCL avoids augmentation-based
noise while preserving semantic relevance. This paradigm eliminates costly view
construction and storage, making it computationally efficient and practical for
real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that NLGCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in effectiveness and
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种IPS的扩展方法，称为IPSsim，该方法在估计IPS时考虑了文档的相似性，以更有效地减轻位置偏差的影响。实验结果表明，IPSsim在学习无偏LTR模型方面比现有方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于位置偏差，用户的点击存在固有的偏差，即用户更可能点击排名靠前的文档，而不是排名靠后的文档。本文认为，与排名靠前相关文档相似的排名靠后文档也可能相关。此外，在计算IPS时，考虑排名靠后文档与排名靠前相关文档的相似性，可以更有效地减轻位置偏差的影响。

Method: 我们提出了IPS的一个扩展，称为IPSsim，它在估计IPS时考虑了文档的相似性。

Result: 我们的实验表明，我们的IPSsim估计器比现有的IPS估计器更有效地学习无偏LTR模型，尤其是在n >= 30的top-n设置中。当n = 50时，与文献中的双重鲁棒估计器相比，我们的IPSsim估计器在NDCG方面实现了统计上显着的约3%的改进(p < 0.05)。

Conclusion: IPSsim在学习无偏LTR模型方面比现有的IPS估计器更有效，尤其是在n >= 30的top-n设置中。例如，当n = 50时，与文献中的双重鲁棒估计器相比，我们的IPSsim估计器在NDCG方面实现了统计上显着的约3%的改进(p < 0.05)。

Abstract: Learning to Rank (LTR) models learn from historical user interactions, such
as user clicks. However, there is an inherent bias in the clicks of users due
to position bias, i.e., users are more likely to click highly-ranked documents
than low-ranked documents. To address this bias when training LTR models, many
approaches from the literature re-weight the users' click data using Inverse
Propensity Scoring (IPS). IPS re-weights the user's clicks proportionately to
the position in the historical ranking that a document was placed when it was
clicked since low-ranked documents are less likely to be seen by a user. In
this paper, we argue that low-ranked documents that are similar to
highly-ranked relevant documents are also likely to be relevant. Moreover,
accounting for the similarity of low-ranked documents to highly ranked relevant
documents when calculating IPS can more effectively mitigate the effects of
position bias. Therefore, we propose an extension to IPS, called IPSsim, that
takes into consideration the similarity of documents when estimating IPS. We
evaluate our IPSsim estimator using two large publicly available LTR datasets
under a number of simulated user click settings, and with different numbers of
training clicks. Our experiments show that our IPSsim estimator is more
effective than the existing IPS estimators for learning an unbiased LTR model,
particularly in top-n settings when n >= 30. For example, when n = 50, our
IPSsim estimator achieves a statistically significant ~3% improvement (p <
0.05) in terms of NDCG compared to the Doubly Robust estimator from the
literature.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Type II errors are important for evaluating IR systems. Balanced classification metrics can be used to portray the discriminative power of qrels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring large volumes of human relevance assessments is expensive, necessitating comparisons between qrels to ascertain their efficacy. Identifying Type II errors (false negatives) is important as they lead science in the wrong direction.

Method: Experiments using qrels generated using alternative relevance assessment methods to investigate measuring hypothesis testing errors in IR evaluation.

Result: Additional insights into the discriminative power of qrels can be gained by quantifying Type II errors, and balanced classification metrics can be used to give an overall summary of discriminative power.

Conclusion: Quantifying Type II errors provides additional insights into the discriminative power of qrels, and balanced classification metrics can summarize discriminative power in one number.

Abstract: The evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) systems typically uses
query-document pairs with corresponding human-labelled relevance assessments
(qrels). These qrels are used to determine if one system is better than another
based on average retrieval performance. Acquiring large volumes of human
relevance assessments is expensive. Therefore, more efficient relevance
assessment approaches have been proposed, necessitating comparisons between
qrels to ascertain their efficacy. Discriminative power, i.e. the ability to
correctly identify significant differences between systems, is important for
drawing accurate conclusions on the robustness of qrels. Previous work has
measured the proportion of pairs of systems that are identified as
significantly different and has quantified Type I statistical errors. Type I
errors lead to incorrect conclusions due to false positive significance tests.
We argue that also identifying Type II errors (false negatives) is important as
they lead science in the wrong direction. We quantify Type II errors and
propose that balanced classification metrics, such as balanced accuracy, can be
used to portray the discriminative power of qrels. We perform experiments using
qrels generated using alternative relevance assessment methods to investigate
measuring hypothesis testing errors in IR evaluation. We find that additional
insights into the discriminative power of qrels can be gained by quantifying
Type II errors, and that balanced classification metrics can be used to give an
overall summary of discriminative power in one, easily comparable, number.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标签偏差会导致数据完整性问题，并且现有方法对于解决它仍然很少

Method: 提出 Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe)

Result: DeCoLe 在偏差感知的错误标记检测方面优于其他方法

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe)的框架，用于检测受标签偏差影响的数据集中错误标记的实例，从而实现偏差感知的错误标记检测并促进数据质量的提高。在仇恨言论检测的背景下评估了其性能，实验结果表明DeCoLe在偏差感知的错误标记检测方面表现出色。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

### [140] [Growing Transformers: Modular Composition and Layer-wise Expansion on a Frozen Substrate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07129)
*A. Bochkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores a constructive approach to LLM development using fixed embeddings, enabling modular composition and layer-wise growth for efficient scaling and improved reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks flexibility.

Method: The paper introduces two scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition by averaging output logits of specialist models, and progressive layer-wise growth by stacking and training one layer at a time.

Result: The paper demonstrates that specialist models can be merged into a single MoE model with performance improvements. It also shows stable convergence and a clear correlation between model depth and reasoning abilities through layer-wise constructive training.

Conclusion: This paper suggests a shift from monolithic optimization to a constructive model of AI development, enabling resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized ecosystem.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

### [141] [FACap: A Large-scale Fashion Dataset for Fine-grained Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07135)
*François Gardères,Shizhe Chen,Camille-Sovanneary Gauthier,Jean Ponce*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset, and a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2. The results show that the combination of FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's performance in fashion CIR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods for CIR leverage large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of manual annotation by specialists.

Method: They propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2, which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for fine-grained fashion-specific information.

Result: Experimental results show that the combination of FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained modification texts

Conclusion: The combination of FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites.

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

TL;DR: 介绍 autoeval-dmun，一种自动化工具，它利用语言模型来彻底评估扩散模型中的机器学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从基础扩散模型中清除不需要的信息是一种很有前景的、经济高效的方法。虽然 MU 的成本比在没有不需要的信息的情况下重新训练扩散模型低几个数量级，但要证明信息已从模型中完全删除可能具有挑战性且劳动强度大。此外，MU 可能会损害人们希望保留的周围概念的扩散模型性能，从而不清楚扩散模型是否仍然适合部署。

Method: autoeval-dmun，一种自动化工具，它利用（视觉）语言模型来彻底评估扩散模型中的机器学习。

Result: 语言模型 (1) 施加了附近概念的语义排序，这与机器学习的损坏非常相关，并且 (2) 通过合成对抗提示有效地规避了机器学习。

Conclusion: 使用自动工具评估流行的扩散模型机器学习方法，揭示了语言模型 (1) 施加了附近概念的语义排序，这与机器学习的损坏非常相关，并且 (2) 通过合成对抗提示有效地规避了机器学习。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP4LP：一种新颖的框架，它结合了基于GNN的节点编码和最短路径上的序列建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNN）通常难以捕获对于准确的链接预测至关重要的链接特定结构模式，因为它们的以节点为中心的消息传递方案忽略了连接一对节点的子图结构。注入这种结构上下文的现有方法要么产生高昂的计算成本，要么依赖于简单的启发式方法（例如，公共邻居计数），而无法对多跳依赖关系进行建模。

Method: 结合了基于GNN的节点编码和最短路径上的序列建模。

Result: SP4LP能够以计算效率捕获表达性多跳关系模式。

Conclusion: SP4LP在链接预测基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。从理论上讲，我们证明了SP4LP比标准消息传递GNN和几种最先进的结构特征方法更具表现力，从而将其确立为图中链接预测的通用且有原则的方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Motivation: 合并参数高效的任务专家作为一种构建模块化架构的方式，受到了越来越多的关注，这种架构可以快速地为特定的下游任务进行动态调整，而不需要额外的微调。

Method: 提出了一种训练高效稀疏适配器的简单方法，该方法在概念上比现有方法更简单，并且在我们设定的环境中，出人意料地优于LoRA和完全微调。

Conclusion: 稀疏适配器合并后，相比LoRA或完整模型合并，产生了更优的分布内性能。对于所有考虑的方法，实现强大的held-out性能仍然是一个挑战。

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: current GCL methods primarily focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes, which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a significant challenge.

Method: introduce topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in effectively capturing this commonsense.

Result: directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL

Conclusion: Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in graph representation learning.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Result: UDE 方法与传统和神经基线相比，可将预测误差显着降低 44%，同时保留可解释性。引入了一种符号恢复方法，可将学习到的神经反馈转化为显式数学表达式，从而揭示网络饱和、安全响应和恶意软件变体演化等抑制机制。

Conclusion: 混合物理信息模型优于纯分析和纯神经方法，可提高预测准确性并加深对恶意软件传播动态的了解。这些发现支持开发早期预警系统、有效的爆发响应策略和有针对性的网络防御干预。

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue. Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue, making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are identified.

Method: an innovative attention-aware GNN-based input classifier

Result: G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that supplement text information in VLMs using LLMs in prompts suffer from high variability and low reliability due to extracting text-based descriptions from LLMs. There is a need for a method that enhances robustness to unseen and diverse data without relying on unreliable text descriptions.

Method: A novel Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul) method that eliminates the process of extracting descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. It adopts a description-free approach, where prompts can encapsulate richer semantics while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, prompt weighting is used to reflect the importance of different prompts during training.

Result: The proposed approach achieves superior performance across 11 recognition datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul) method achieves superior performance across 11 recognition datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 即使对于最有能力的模型，仍然存在频繁的失败案例，这让人怀疑它们的组合性。因此，我们试图了解一个标准的神经网络在共享组合结构的任务中进行泛化需要什么。

Method: 扩展数据和模型大小

Result: 简单地扩展数据和模型大小可以导致组合泛化。我们表明，只要训练分布充分覆盖任务空间，这就可以跨不同的任务编码成立。

Conclusion: 标准多层感知器可以使用相对于任务模块数量的线性数量的神经元，以任意精度逼近一类通用的组合任务族。如果网络成功地进行组合泛化，则可以从它们的隐藏激活中线性解码任务的组成部分。这个指标与文本到图像生成模型组合已知概念的失败相关。

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VAMPnet和DPNet等深度学习方法需要在目标计算过程中通过经验二阶矩矩阵上潜在的数值不稳定运算（例如奇异值分解和矩阵求逆）进行反向传播，这会引入有偏差的梯度估计并阻碍大型系统的可扩展性。

Method: 该方法基于低秩近似的思想，消除了对不稳定线性代数运算的需求，并且易于集成到现代深度学习管道中。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种可扩展且概念简单的方法，用于学习随机动力系统的Koopman算子的前k个奇异函数。经验结果表明，所学习的奇异子空间对于特征分析和多步预测等下游任务既可靠又有效。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

TL;DR: MUSE leverages diverse LLMs to improve uncertainty estimation through subset ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs behave inconsistently, indicating uncertainty that needs quantification. Model diversity can be leveraged for better uncertainty estimation.

Method: MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), an information-theoretic method using Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs.

Result: Improved calibration and predictive performance on binary prediction tasks compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Conclusion: Aggregating outputs from diverse LLMs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究引入了一个用于断裂建模的ML方法的数据集，并使用PINN、FNO和UNet模型作为基线进行了评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的方法有潜力使复杂、非线性物理现象的建模在计算上更易于处理。例如，断裂的计算建模是一个核心挑战，机器学习技术有潜力提供急需的加速，从而推动多尺度建模和不确定性量化等领域取得进展。当前，断裂的相场建模（PFM）就是这样一种方法，它提供了一种方便的变分公式来模拟裂纹的形核、分支和扩展。然而，大多数研究依赖于过于简单的基准，这些基准不能反映PFM作为一种方法所擅长的断裂过程的真实复杂性。

Method: 该研究使用了物理信息神经网络（PINN）、傅里叶神经算子（FNO）和UNet模型作为基线，并探讨了集成策略对预测精度的影响。

Result: 该研究引入了一个具有挑战性的数据集，该数据集基于PFM模拟，旨在为断裂建模的ML方法建立基准并推进ML方法。该数据集包括三种能量分解方法、两种边界条件和1,000个随机初始裂纹配置，总共进行了6,000次模拟。每个样本包含100个时间步长，捕捉裂纹场的时序演化。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了当前流行模型的潜力和局限性，并证明了该数据集作为推进断裂力学研究中机器学习的试验平台的效用。

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型 (LLM) 和视觉语言模型 (VLM) 在规模和应用上的增长，注意力机制因其高内存和时间复杂度而成为中心计算瓶颈。虽然已经提出了许多有效的注意力变体，但仍然缺乏对其在训练期间的实际能量使用和硬件资源需求的严格评估。

Result: 结果表明，具有优化内核实现的注意力机制（包括 Flash Attention、Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention 和 Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)）实现了最佳能源效率。研究进一步表明，仅降低 GPU 功率并不能保证降低能源消耗，因为训练时间也起着同样重要的作用。

Conclusion: 具有优化内核实现的注意力机制（包括 Flash Attention、LSH 注意力和 MLA）实现了最佳能源效率。仅降低 GPU 功率并不能保证降低能源消耗，因为训练时间也起着同样重要的作用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Motivation: 分布式深度学习模型在物联网环境中部署时，将模型分割到多个计算节点，引入了新的安全风险。与传统推理设置不同，这些分布式管道将模型计算跨越异构节点和通信层，从而扩大了潜在攻击者的攻击面。

Method: 提出了一种针对分布式环境的利用策略，通过统计分析重建向量化传输特征的原始张量形状，并相应地调整代理架构以实现有效的特征提取。

Result: 证明了即使边缘和云组件都不可访问，拦截中间特征的攻击者仍然可以构成严重威胁。通过拦截的特征训练的代理模型可以有效地生成对抗样本，从而显著提高对抗攻击的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 中间特征泄露使得分布式深度学习系统容易受到对抗攻击，需要在设计时考虑。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently, contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality is missing.

Method: We propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing modality conditions.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates a robust multimodal learning framework that effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个将治疗效果轨迹建模为剂量和时间上的平滑曲面的框架，从而能够提取临床可操作的见解，例如发病时间、峰值效应和持续获益时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平均治疗效果 (ATE) 是因果推理中的一个基本指标，广泛用于评估随机对照试验 (RCT) 中干预的有效性。然而，在许多应用中（尤其是在医疗保健领域），这种静态摘要无法捕捉到随剂量和时间变化的治疗效果的细微动态。

Method: 将用于可解释轨迹建模的 SemanticODE 框架调整到因果关系设置，在该设置中，永远无法直接观察到治疗效果。该方法将轨迹形状的估计与临床相关属性（例如，最大值、拐点）的规范分离，支持领域先验、事后编辑和透明分析。

Result: 该方法产生准确、可解释且可编辑的治疗动态模型。

Conclusion: 该方法生成准确、可解释且可编辑的治疗动态模型，有助于严格的因果分析和实际决策。

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

Motivation: 对于像随机森林这样的复杂模型，特征重要性不是固有的。当存在依赖特征时，排列特征重要性可能会产生误导。

Method: 开发了一种名为 TRIP 的测试，该测试只需要最少的假设，并且可以检测不可靠的排列特征重要性分数。

Result: 在模拟数据和应用测试中，TRIP 可以可靠地检测排列特征重要性分数何时不可靠。

Conclusion: TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation) 可以检测由于模型外推导致的不可靠的排列特征重要性分数。

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

Conclusion: 通过强制重建位于学习流形上，该方法增强了对不适定反问题的解决方案，特别是在生物医学成像中。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Motivation: Balancing model performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency in non-IID decentralized federated learning environments is challenging.

Method: A hybrid classical-quantum federated learning framework integrating a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture, an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme, selective homomorphic encryption, and dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing.

Result: AdeptHEQ-FL achieves accuracy improvements of approximately 25.43% and 14.17% over Standard-FedQNN and FHE-FedQNN on CIFAR-10, respectively, and reduces communication overhead.

Conclusion: AdeptHEQ-FL achieves significant accuracy improvements over existing methods while reducing communication overhead, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality for privacy-preserving and resource-aware federated learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model

non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design

*Dongyu Wei,Xiaoren Xu,Shiwen Mao,Mingzhe Chen*

TL;DR: This paper proposes a DPVD-MARL algorithm for secure and communication-efficient clustered federated learning (CFL), which improves convergence rate and accumulated rewards compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize the training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay in a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated learning (CFL) design.

Method: A novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem.

Result: The proposed DPVD-MARL algorithm enables distributed BSs to independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks across all BSs.

Conclusion: The DPVD-MARL algorithm improves convergence rate by up to 20% and accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning, as shown in the simulation results.

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cGAN-based framework to generate stealthy adversarial attacks on UAVs and uses a CVAE to detect these attacks, demonstrating improved performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats in UAV intrusion detection systems (IDS), and conventional out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events.

Method: A conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework is used to craft stealthy adversarial attacks, and a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) is implemented to detect these perturbations by leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial inputs from authentic out-of-distribution (OOD) samples.

Result: The CVAE-based regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats.

Conclusion: Advanced probabilistic modeling is crucial for robust intrusion detection systems (IDS) against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions, as demonstrated by the superior performance of CVAE-based regret scores in identifying stealthy adversarial threats compared to traditional Mahalanobis distance-based detectors.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

*Dongyu Wei,Xiaoren Xu,Yuchen Liu,H. Vincent Poor,Mingzhe Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework to minimize information leakage to eavesdroppers in private split learning by using deceptive signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent eavesdroppers from collecting model and data information in collaborative training by using deceptive signals.

Method: A soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA).

Result: The ICM-CA method improves convergence and reduces information leakage.

Conclusion: The proposed ICM-CA method improves convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces information leaked to eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

*Malikussaid,Hilal Hudan Nuha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of LLMs generating plausible but invalid information in chemistry by fine-tuning a model with a dual-domain dataset. The fine-tuned model shows improvements but still has limitations in stereochemistry, knowledge cutoff, and hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry.

Method: We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure quality.

Result: Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference hallucination.

Conclusion: This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also delineating critical areas for future improvement.

Motivation: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space, blurring heterogeneous topologies.

Method: A lightweight Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer is prepended to route each node to various kinds of manifold, mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic, best matching its local structure.

Result: The projector lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks when inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer.

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector

makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policies trained via DRL often struggle to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters, and obtaining sufficient training data across diverse contexts can be impractical.

Method: The paper introduces the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) and derives context sample enhancement (CSE) to approximate it.

Result: The paper proves analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts and numerically validates the performance of CSE in simulation environments.

Conclusion: The paper introduces context sample enhancement (CSE) as a data augmentation method to improve generalization in DRL, validated in simulation environments.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the statistical complexity of PU learning without assuming the class prior is known, and provides sample size bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively labeled points is known apriori to the learner.

Method: theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU learning

Result: upper and lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and the unlabeled samples)

Conclusion: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU learning under a wider range of setups. We prove upper and lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and the unlabeled samples).

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与旨在推断完整因果模型的传统方法不同，GO-CBED 直接最大化用户指定的感兴趣的因果量上的预期信息增益 (EIG)，从而实现更有针对性和更有效的实验。

Method: 提出了一种面向目标的贝叶斯框架，用于序列因果实验设计。引入了一种变分下界估计器，通过基于 Transformer 的策略网络和基于归一化流的变分后验联合优化。

Result: 策略通过摊销网络实现实时决策。GO-CBED 在各种因果推理和发现任务中始终优于现有基线，包括合成结构因果模型和半合成基因调控网络。

Conclusion: GO-CBED在各种因果推理和发现任务中始终优于现有基线，尤其是在实验预算有限和因果机制复杂的环境中。结果强调了将实验设计目标与特定研究目标对齐以及前瞻性顺序规划的好处。

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

Motivation: 当前基于图的疾病分类方法检测患者特异性分子指纹，但在队列范围特征方面缺乏一致性和理解，而这对于理解不同动脉粥样硬化轨迹中的致病表型至关重要。此外，理解患者亚型通常孤立地考虑临床特征相似性，而没有整合患者之间共享的致病相互依赖性。

Method: 开发了一种分层图神经网络框架，以利用患者的两种特征模式：队列中的临床特征和个体患者特有的分子数据。

Result: 在391名患者的主要临床数据集中，我们证明了临床特征与分子相互作用模式的这种异构对齐，已将亚临床动脉粥样硬化分类性能在各种基线上提高了高达13%的受试者工作特征曲线下面积（AUC）和20%的F1分数。

Conclusion: ATHENA通过可解释的AI驱动的子网络聚类，实现了机制驱动的患者亚型发现；这种新颖的集成框架加强了个性化干预策略，从而改善了动脉粥样硬化疾病进展的预测和临床可操作结果的管理。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and

Conclusion: TLC在转移路径采样和状态区分方面表现出与现有MLCV方法相等或更优越的性能。

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法在各种任务中表现良好，并且明显优于基线方法。

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

*Paul M. Riechers,Thomas J. Elliott,Adam S. Shai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: deep neural networks discover and represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative models of their training data


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: discover and represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative models of their training data

Method: deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs, pretrained as usual on next-token prediction

Result: geometric relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the future.

Conclusion: neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is no finite classical circuit that would do the job

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

TL;DR: discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications of those models in the chemical sciences


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in conventional machine learning approaches completely

Method: review recent applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process

Result: discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.

Conclusion: We expect that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the coming years.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

### [183] [Resolving Token-Space Gradient Conflicts: Token Space Manipulation for Transformer-Based Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07485)
*Wooseong Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多任务学习框架，该框架通过在token空间中进行自适应调整来提高性能，且计算开销很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习(MTL)使得在共享网络中学习多个任务成为可能，但是任务之间目标的不同会导致负迁移，即一个任务的学习会降低另一个任务的性能。虽然预训练的transformer显著提高了MTL的性能，但它们固定的网络容量和 rigid 的结构限制了适应性。先前的动态网络架构试图解决这个问题，但由于它们直接将共享参数转换为特定于任务的参数，因此效率低下。

Method: 提出动态Token调制和扩展(DTME-MTL)，这是一种适用于任何基于transformer的MTL架构的框架。DTME-MTL通过识别token空间中的梯度冲突并应用基于冲突类型的自适应解决方案来增强适应性并减少过度拟合。

Result: DTME-MTL在多项任务中都表现出了一致的提升，且计算开销很小。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL在计算开销最小的情况下持续提高多任务性能，为增强基于transformer的MTL模型提供了一个可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

### [184] [Uncertainty Quantification for Motor Imagery BCI -- Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07511)
*Joris Suurmeijer,Ivo Pascal de Jong,Matias Valdenegro-Toro,Andreea Ioana Sburlea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSP-LDA 和 MDRM-T 在 BCI 分类中提供最佳不确定性估计，而深度学习模型提供最佳分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口 (BCI) 将大脑信号转化为功能上有用的输出，但它们并不总是准确的。一个好的机器学习分类器应该能够通过给出其分类的概率来表明它对给定分类的置信度。运动图像 BCI 的标准分类器确实给出了这样的概率，但对不确定性量化的研究仅限于深度学习。

Method: 比较使用通用空间模式 (CSP-LDA) 和黎曼几何 (MDRM) 的已建立 BCI 分类器与深度学习（深度集成和直接不确定性量化）以及标准卷积神经网络 (CNN) 中的专门方法的不确定性量化能力。

Result: 发现深度学习中常见的过度自信在 CSP-LDA 和 MDRM 中不是问题。发现 MDRM 不够自信，通过添加温度缩放 (MDRM-T) 解决了这个问题。CSP-LDA 和 MDRM-T 提供了最佳的不确定性估计，但深度集成和标准 CNN 提供了最佳分类。

Conclusion: CSP-LDA 和 MDRM-T 提供了最佳的不确定性估计，但深度集成和标准 CNN 提供了最佳分类。所有模型都能够区分容易和困难的估计，因此我们可以通过拒绝模糊的样本来提高运动图像 BCI 的准确性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

*Berkant Turan,Suhrab Asadulla,David Steinmann,Wolfgang Stammer,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCV结合了PVG和概念编码，实现了高性能、可解释的非线性分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PVG没有应用于复杂输入，CBM受限于低容量线性预测器。

Method: 结合了PVG和概念编码的统一框架

Result: NCV在高性能、逻辑复杂的数据集上优于CBM和基于像素的PVG分类器基线，并有助于缓解shortcut行为。

Conclusion: NCV是一种很有前途的、可执行的、可验证的AI方法。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAD是一种用于多元时间序列的实时解相关异常检测方法，它在检测效果和计算效率之间取得了最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着(工业)物联网的兴起，对实时AD的需求激增，需要即时处理大量的多元传感器数据。

Method: 基于在线解相关学习方法，DAD动态地学习和监控数据样本的相关结构。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验表明，与最先进的方法相比，DAD在各种异常类型中实现了最一致和卓越的性能。

Conclusion: DAD在检测效果和计算效率之间取得了最佳平衡，并为实时的、内存受限的异常检测设定了新的标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无反演正则化框架，以解决现有神经网络方法中的数值不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经网络方法由于依赖于涉及显式 Gram 矩阵计算及其后续反演的经典公式而遭受数值不稳定性。

Method: 提出了一种新的无反演正则化框架

Result: 该方法可以处理可能的具有挑战性的场景：(1) 当校准矩阵超过 GPU 内存容量时，(2) 当输入激活矩阵接近奇异时，甚至 (3) 当数据不足以防止唯一逼近时。对于后者，我们证明了我们的解决方案收敛到期望的近似值并推导出显式误差界限。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的无反演正则化框架，该框架完全基于稳定的分解，克服了现有技术的数值缺陷。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

*Michail Kalntis,Fernando A. Kuipers,George Iosifidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a meta-learning framework for optimizing conditional handovers (CHOs) in O-RAN, achieving 180% better performance than 3GPP benchmarks in volatile conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell preparations and releases

Method: a novel framework aligned with the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization

Result: providing robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions

Conclusion: This paper presents a novel framework aligned with the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

TL;DR: proposed an optimal clustering mechanism for the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database, O*NET, using several BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: definitions of occupations can vary for different firms and countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the definitions will be a vital requirement

Method: a pipeline using several BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches

Result: improved results by using a specialized silhouette approach

Conclusion: A new clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people wanting to change their careers.

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

*Sebastian Lotter,Elisabeth Mohr,Andrina Rutsch,Lukas Brand,Francesca Ronchi,Laura Díaz-Marugán*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using machine learning to modulate the gut-brain axis (GBA) for therapeutic purposes, leveraging personal health data to design more versatile and robust treatments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating signals inside the human body poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal, safety, and ethical issues. Existing treatments are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients while failing to help others.

Method: The paper proposes a machine learning model to verify the requirements for practical scenarios when only limited data on the GBA modulation exists.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates excellent accuracy in identifying different modulators of the GBA. The model is used to identify specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA modulation.

Conclusion: The paper utilizes a machine learning model to identify specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA modulation.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

Abstract: Federated Learning offers privacy-preserving collaborative intelligence but
struggles to meet the sustainability demands of emerging IoT ecosystems
necessary for Society 5.0-a human-centered technological future balancing
social advancement with environmental responsibility. The excessive
communication bandwidth and computational resources required by traditional FL
approaches make them environmentally unsustainable at scale, creating a
fundamental conflict with green AI principles as billions of
resource-constrained devices attempt to participate. To this end, we introduce
Sparse Proximity-based Self-Federated Learning (SParSeFuL), a resource-aware
approach that bridges this gap by combining aggregate computing for
self-organization with neural network sparsification to reduce energy and
bandwidth consumption.

TL;DR: SLOGAN通过稀疏因果建模和动态干预机制实现稳定的图表示迁移，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督图领域自适应（UGDA）方法由于因果-虚假特征的纠缠和全局对齐策略的失败，通常会产生次优结果。

Method: SLOGAN首先构建稀疏因果图结构，利用互信息瓶颈约束来解开稀疏、稳定的因果特征，同时通过变分推理压缩依赖于领域的虚假相关性。为了解决残余的虚假相关性，我们创新地设计了一种生成干预机制，通过跨域特征重组来打破局部虚假耦合，同时通过协方差约束来保持因果特征语义一致性。此外，为了减轻目标域伪标签中的误差累积，我们引入了一种类别自适应动态校准策略，确保稳定的判别学习。

Result: SLOGAN在多个真实世界数据集上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SLOGAN在多个真实世界数据集上显著优于现有基线。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Motivation: 在多序列磁共振成像(MRI)数据中分析颈动脉(特别是斑块)对于评估动脉粥样硬化和缺血性中风的风险至关重要。为了评估指标和放射组学特征，量化动脉粥样硬化的状态，准确的分割非常重要。然而，斑块的复杂形态和标记数据的稀缺性带来了巨大的挑战。

important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.
