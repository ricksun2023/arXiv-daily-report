TL;DR: This paper introduces a Model Synthesis Architecture (MSA) that combines language models and probabilistic programs to mimic human reasoning in novel situations. The MSA outperforms language model baselines in capturing human judgments on a novel reasoning dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: What permits us to draw in globally relevant information and reason over it coherently?

Method: a ``Model Synthesis Architecture'' (MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent world models

Result: Our MSA approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines, under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports model synthesis.

Conclusion: MSAs can be implemented in a way that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating human reasoning in open-ended domains.

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们发现语言模型能够可靠地进行情态分类，并且通过研究模型内部的“情态差异向量”，可以深入了解人类的情态分类方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了可靠地完成这些任务，语言模型必须能够识别句子的模态类别（即可行、不可能或完全无意义等）。然而，最近的研究对语言模型根据模态对句子进行分类的能力提出了质疑。

Method: 我们通过识别各种语言模型中的模态类别之间的线性表示（即模态差异向量）来区分模态类别。

Result: 对模态差异向量的分析表明，语言模型能够做出比之前报告的更可靠的模态分类判断。此外，我们发现，随着模型变得更强大（即通过训练步骤、层和参数数量），模态差异向量以一致的顺序出现。值得注意的是，我们发现语言模型激活中识别出的模态差异向量可用于模拟细粒度的人类分类行为。

Conclusion: 利用可解释性技术，我们对语言模型中的情态分类进行了新的分析，并且可能有助于我们理解人类的情态分类。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

Motivation: 构建车臣语和俄语之间翻译的首个开源模型。

Method: 通过对大型语言模型 NLLB-200 进行微调，将车臣语加入多语种翻译系统。

Result: 模型在俄语到车臣语和反向翻译的 BLEU / ChrF++ 分数分别为 8.34 / 34.69 和 20.89 / 44.55。

### [4] [Improving Drug Identification in Overdose Death Surveillance using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12679)
*Arthur J. Funnell,Panayiotis Petousis,Fabrice Harel-Canada,Ruby Romero,Alex A. T. Bui,Adam Koncsol,Hritika Chaturvedi,Chelsea Shover,David Goodman-Meza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uses NLP models to classify overdose deaths from free-text reports, finding that fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models perform best and can improve surveillance workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of Disease)-10 classifications.

Method: Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3.

Result: Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large language models.

Conclusion: NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10 coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use trends.

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

### [5] [AdaptiSent: Context-Aware Adaptive Attention for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12695)
*S M Rafiuddin,Sadia Kamal,Mohammed Rakib,Arunkumar Bagavathi,Atriya Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaptiSent, a new framework, uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms to improve sentiment classification. It surpasses existing models in precision, recall, and F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text and images

Method: a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms

Result: AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying nuanced inter-modal relationships

Conclusion: AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

### [6] [SemCSE: Semantic Contrastive Sentence Embeddings Using LLM-Generated Summaries For Scientific Abstracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13105)
*Marc Brinner,Sina Zarriess*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCSE, a new unsupervised method, uses LLM-generated summaries and contrastive learning to create semantic embeddings of scientific texts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional citation-based approaches do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.

Method: An unsupervised method leveraging LLM-generated summaries of scientific abstracts and contrastive learning.

Result: SemCSE enforces a stronger semantic separation within the embedding space, validated by a novel benchmark.

Conclusion: SemCSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SciRepEval benchmark, demonstrating the benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

### [7] [AudioJudge: Understanding What Works in Large Audio Model Based Speech Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12705)
*Potsawee Manakul,Woody Haosheng Gan,Michael J. Ryan,Ali Sartaz Khan,Warit Sirichotedumrong,Kunat Pipatanakul,William Held,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Audio Models (LAMs) can be used for speech evaluation, achieving high correlation with human preferences, but require mitigation of verbosity and positional biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech evaluation suffers from limitations in designing specialized systems and poor correlation with human preferences.

Method: Audio concatenation combined with in-context learning and multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge.

Result: Achieved up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with human preferences on system ranking benchmark; strong performance under acoustic noise.

Conclusion: LAMs are effective for speech evaluation but exhibit verbosity and positional biases.

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

### [8] [Automating Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13255)
*Lyucheng Wu,Mengru Wang,Ziwen Xu,Tri Cao,Nay Oo,Bryan Hooi,Shumin Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSteer, a modular intervention technology, improves the safety of MLLMs during inference by reducing the attack success rate on textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, without fine-tuning the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs.

Method: a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS); (2) an adaptive safety prober; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head.

Result: AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities.

Conclusion: AutoSteer is a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

### [9] [FLEXITOKENS: Flexible Tokenization for Evolving Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12720)
*Abraham Toluase Owodunni,Orevaoghene Ahia,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FLEXITOKENS, a new training objective that enables greater flexibility during adaptation, consistently reduces token over-fragmentation, and achieves up to 10% improvements on downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers, which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts.

Method: develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive. Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation.

Result: demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10% improvements on downstream task performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers.

Conclusion: FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10% improvements on downstream task performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we

Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and

TL;DR: TalentCLEF 2025 是第一个专注于技能和职位情报的评估活动，它提供了一个公共基准，以鼓励为劳动力市场开发稳健、公平和可转移的语言技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理和大型语言模型的进步正在推动人力资本管理发生重大变革。可靠和公平的模型的开发，在公共数据和开放基准上进行适当评估，对于这些技术的采用和进步至关重要，但到目前为止，该领域还没有这样的模型。

Method: 使用对比学习进行微调的多语言编码器模型构建的信息检索技术，以及用于数据增强或重新排序的大型语言模型。

Result: 结果表明，训练策略比模型本身的大小影响更大。TalentCLEF 吸引了 76 个注册团队，提交了 280 多个作品。

Conclusion: TalentCLEF 提供了一个公共基准，鼓励为劳动力市场开发稳健、公平和可转移的语言技术。

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

*Richard Sproat,Tianyu Zhao,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransEvalnia is a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking system that performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker and the evaluations returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the Multidimensional Quality Metrics, returns an assessment of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the various dimensions and for the overall translation.

Method: a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking

Result: TransEvalnia performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from various WMT shared tasks. The evaluations returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well with scores assigned by the human raters.

Conclusion: TransEvalnia performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker and the evaluations returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters.

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往使用 prompt engineering 的狼人杀 agent 采用隐式定义有效策略的方法，无法适应变化的情况。

Method: 提出了一种基于其他玩家的态度和对话上下文在预定义策略之间切换的方法。

Result: 验证了所提出的方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 策略自适应的狼人杀 agent 性能优于使用隐式或固定策略的 agent。

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on
the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the
strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or
fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

*Yunxiang Zhang,Muhammad Khalifa,Lechen Zhang,Xin Liu,Ayoung Lee,Xinliang Frederick Zhang,Farima Fatahi Bayat,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO, methods to elicit long reasoning in large language models with minimal training, achieving significant performance improvements on mathematical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. This work investigates whether such behavior can be elicited without any training.

Method: ThinkLogit, a decoding-time approach, utilizes logits arithmetic to tune a target large LM for long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. Further boosted by training the guider model with preference optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the target and guider model (ThinkLogit-DPO).

Result: ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model.

Conclusion: ThinkLogit is a computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with minimal or no additional training.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Synergy, a byte-level language model, learns to tokenize bytes and shows advantages over BBPE and Llama3, suggesting the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge different levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion.

Method: The authors trained a byte-level language model with a learned routing mechanism.

Result: The model spontaneously learns to tokenize bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than BBPE while keeping comparable performance. Synergy shows advantages compared to Llama3. The middle part of the model performs better when positional encodings are removed.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for more robust and flexible pipelines.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

*Thinh Hung Truong,Karin Verspoor,Trevor Cohn,Timothy Baldwin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种提高文本编码器否定鲁棒性的策略，通过从大型语言模型中提取数据，使用不同的否定和对冲模式来提高文本编码器否定鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然自回归大型语言模型被迅速采用，但较小的文本编码器在需要丰富的上下文表示的文本理解任务中仍然发挥着重要作用。否定是一种重要的语义功能，但此类方法仍未正确捕获，从而影响了许多依赖文本嵌入的下游应用。

Method: 从大型语言模型中提取数据，并采用标准的对比学习策略来微调一个强大的基于 BERT 的模型。

Result: 在否定理解能力方面取得了显著的进步，同时在通用基准测试中保持了竞争性的表现。该方法还可应用于大型语言模型，从而提高否定基准测试的性能。

Conclusion: 通过从大型语言模型中提取数据，并使用对比学习策略微调 BERT 模型，显著提高了文本编码器在否定理解方面的能力，同时保持了在通用基准测试中的竞争力。该方法还可应用于大型语言模型，从而提高否定基准测试的性能。

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

*Andrew Shin,Kunitake Kaneko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from textual prompts and evaluating their utility through recognition and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored.

Method: generating symbolic music data from textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their performance against established models.

Result: LLMs can infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text.

Conclusion: LLMs can infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text, highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency for factual knowledge


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance

Method: examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of a model in cross-lingual contexts

Result: knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency in many cases

Conclusion:  multilingual models show different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer. code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment objectives show the most promising results

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层解码器架构，通过将语言头从最后一层复制到中间层并进行微调，实现了在多个任务上的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类分层思维能力的启发，我们提出可以构建一种分层解码器架构，其中不同的层同时解码文本。

Method: 将预训练语言模型的语言头复制到不同的选定中间层，并使用不同的任务输入进行微调。

Result: 实验验证了这些选择性的中间层可以被调整为表达有意义和合理的内容，并且这种分层解码器的范例可以在分层文本分类、分类引导生成和分层文本生成等多个任务上获得最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，分层解码器有可能成为一种通用的分层推理器，可以从头开始进行预训练。

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtain answers to questions about tables in Spanish.

Method: Implements Python code generation with LLMs to filter and process the table.

Result: The solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table.

Conclusion: Achieved an accuracy score of 85% in the task.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a UML-based model for formalizing attack scenarios, enabling automation in attack analysis and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations need cybersecurity automation due to the evolving threat landscape, requiring formalized input data like attack scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes a UML class model to formalize attack scenarios.

Result: The model's utility is demonstrated through two use cases: upstream attack analysis and automatic generation of attack scripts for cybersecurity training.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel formal model for attack scenarios, abstracted using a UML class model.

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

TL;DR: 本博士提案介绍了开发一个计算框架以识别文本中的自我方面的计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强调需要进行基于 NLP 的系统分析。计划引入自我方面的本体和一个黄金标准注释数据集。

Method: 计划开发和评估传统的判别模型、生成型大型语言模型和基于嵌入的检索方法。

Result: 针对四个主要标准评估：可解释性、真实性、准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: 计划在心理健康和经验现象学案例研究中应用表现最佳的模型。

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究调查了注释者人口统计学特征对性别歧视检测任务的影响，发现内容比人口统计学特征更重要，并且简单的角色引导并不能提高 Generative AI 模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解注释中变异的来源对于开发公平的自然语言处理系统至关重要，尤其是在性别歧视检测等任务中，人口统计学偏差是一个值得关注的问题。

Method: 使用广义线性混合模型量化人口统计学特征对标注决策的影响。

Result: 人口统计学因素仅占观察到的方差的很小一部分（8%），推文内容是主要因素。简单的角色引导通常不能提高 GenAI 模型的性能，有时甚至会降低性能。模型预测主要依赖于与性别歧视相关的内容特定标记，而不是人口特征的相关性。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，与模拟人口特征相比，关注内容驱动的解释和稳健的注释协议，能为实现公平提供更可靠的路径。

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

TL;DR: This study examines the features of oral narratives from children requiring intervention. Lexical diversity and length are indicators of typical development. Specific verbs are correlated with a reduced likelihood of requiring intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development. This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were identified by experts as requiring intervention.

Method: Using simple machine learning methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans- and isiXhosa-speaking children.

Result: Consistent with prior research, we identify lexical diversity and length-based features as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation rate prove less informative. the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of requiring intervention.

Conclusion: Analysis of two languages reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency, with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了GEMMAS，一个图评估框架，用于分析多智能体系统的内部协作过程，发现仅关注最终输出的正确性是不够的，过程级别的诊断非常重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于语言模型构建的多智能体系统在协作推理任务上表现出强大的性能。然而，现有的评估只关注最终输出的正确性，忽略了低效的沟通和糟糕的协调如何导致冗余推理和更高的计算成本。

Method: 我们引入了 GEMMAS，一个基于图的评估框架，通过将智能体交互建模为有向无环图来分析内部协作过程。为了捕捉协作质量，我们提出了两个过程级指标：信息多样性得分 (IDS) 来衡量智能体间消息的语义变化，以及不必要路径比率 (UPR) 来量化冗余推理路径。

Result: 我们在五个基准上评估 GEMMAS，并重点介绍了 GSM8K 的结果，其中准确率仅相差 2.1% 的系统在 IDS 方面相差 12.8%，在 UPR 方面相差 80%，揭示了内部协作的显着差异。这些发现表明，仅使用结果的指标不足以评估多智能体的性能，并强调了过程级别诊断在设计更易于解释和资源高效的协作 AI 系统中的重要性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，仅使用结果指标不足以评估多智能体的性能，并强调了在设计更易于解释和资源高效的协作人工智能系统中，过程级诊断的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for

scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with unseen tasks, especially in data-scarce scenarios, and cross-task in-context learning faces challenges in robustness, scalability, and efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes CAST, a framework that selects influential samples from high-resource tasks and uses their contrastive representation-enhanced activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks.

Result: Experiments across cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer show that CAST outperforms baselines, demonstrating superior scalability and lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The paper introduces CAST, a Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework, which transfers knowledge to low-resource tasks by manipulating the model's internal activation states based on activation patterns observed in LLMs. Experiments show CAST outperforms baselines with better scalability and lower costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

Motivation: LLMs' abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our understanding of whether these models generalize across languages.

Method: A grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive theories of analogical reasoning.

Conclusion: The test set addresses the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in Hindi.

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in

Conclusion: QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and

Conclusion: RCPS significantly outperforms baseline methods and produces presentations close to human expert standards. PREVAL is a reliable automated tool for assessing presentation quality.

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated

Motivation: 为了评估LLM在为科学研究设计消融研究方面的能力。

Method: 提出了AbGen-Eval，一个元评估基准，用于评估常用自动评估系统在衡量LLM性能方面的可靠性。

Result: 领先的LLM（如DeepSeek-R1-0528和o4-mini）在消融研究设计的重要性、忠实性和合理性方面与人类专家存在显著的性能差距。当前的自动评估方法对于这项任务并不可靠。

Conclusion: 当前自动评估方法对于评估LLM在复杂科学任务中的表现并不靠谱，需要进一步研究更有效和可靠的基于LLM的评估系统。

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

Method: 创建了首个完全人工标注的触觉字幕数据集 HapticCap，其中包含 92,070 个触觉-文本对，用于用户描述振动的感官、情感和联想属性。提出了触觉字幕检索任务，并展示了来自监督对比学习框架的该任务的结果，该框架将特定类别中的文本表示和振动结合在一起。

Result: HapticCap 数据集包含 92,070 个触觉-文本对。语言模型 T5 和音频模型 AST 的结合在触觉字幕检索任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 语言模型 T5 和音频模型 AST 的结合在触觉字幕检索任务中表现最佳，尤其是在针对每个描述类别分别训练时。

Abstract: Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Search engines and user queries contribute to bias and polarization in search results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how search engines and ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results.

Method: Analysis of search engine outputs using a dataset of political and social topics.

Result: Search engines prioritize content reflecting biases, ideologically-driven queries exacerbate these biases, and differences exist across search engines in source prioritization.

Conclusion: Search engines reinforce ideological divides, contributing to information polarization.

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VL training improves how language models use taxonomic knowledge for specific tasks, even in text-only scenarios, but doesn't significantly change the underlying taxonomic knowledge itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The domain in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization.

Method: Comparing minimal pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, using an array of targeted behavioral and representational analyses.

Result: VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts mentioned in the questions. LMs and VLMs do not differ significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs. a non-taxonomic relation.

Conclusion: VL training improves the deployment of taxonomic knowledge in the context of a specific task, even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic, but the taxonomic knowledge itself does not change substantially through additional VL training.

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TAIL的方法，通过模仿图灵机的执行过程来提高LLM的长度泛化能力，并在合成数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的大型语言模型（LLM）面临着一个核心挑战，即长度泛化能力，也就是解决比训练期间观察到的更长序列问题的能力。现有的研究主要集中在算术运算和符号操作任务的数据驱动方法，但这些方法往往是特定于任务的，整体性能有限。为了寻求更通用的解决方案，本文着重研究了更广泛的可计算推理问题，即算法可以解决的问题，因此可以由图灵机解决。

Method: 本文提出了一种图灵机模仿学习（TAIL）方法，通过计算机程序合成模仿图灵机执行过程的思维链（CoT）数据，线性扩展推理步骤为原子状态，以缓解shortcut learning，并利用显式内存获取机制来降低基本操作中动态和长程数据访问的难度。

Result: TAIL使用合成数据显著提高了Qwen2.5-7B在各种任务上的长度泛化能力和性能，超越了以往的方法和DeepSeek-R1。实验结果表明，图灵机的关键概念，而非思维方式，对于TAIL的长度泛化是不可或缺的，模型在注意力层中表现出与图灵机属性一致的读写行为。

Conclusion: TAIL显著提高了Qwen2.5-7B在各种任务上的长度泛化能力和性能，超过了以往的方法和DeepSeek-R1。实验结果表明，图灵机的关键概念对于TAIL的长度泛化是不可或缺的，模型在注意力层中表现出与图灵机属性一致的读写行为。

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,

TL;DR: This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour. The paper finds that none of the tested models are capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour form.

Method: We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns, contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on reasoning beyond 'common sense', rooted instead in world knowledge regarding news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour explanation.

Result: We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly simple joke forms.

Motivation: 最先进的视觉语言模型(VLMs)在预测自我中心运动后场景的外观等简单任务中经常遇到困难：它们感知2D图像，但缺乏3D动态的内部模型。

Method: 将VLM与基于视频扩散的可控世界模型相结合，VLM迭代地勾勒出简洁的相机轨迹，而世界模型则在每个步骤合成相应的视图。然后，VLM根据交互探索期间收集的多视图证据进行推理。

Result: MindJourney在SAT基准测试中平均提高了8%的性能，并且改进了通过强化学习训练的测试时推理VLMs。

Conclusion: MindJourney在SAT基准测试中平均提高了8%的性能，证明了将VLMs与世界模型配对进行测试时扩展是一种实现鲁棒3D推理的简单、即插即用的途径。同时，该方法也改进了通过强化学习训练的测试时推理VLMs，证明了该方法利用世界模型进行测试时扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

Conclusion: Mono-InternVL and Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieve competitive or superior performance compared to existing MLLMs while reducing training and inference costs, with Mono-InternVL-1.5 also reducing first-token latency compared to its modular counterpart.

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

Method: 提出了一种分层多尺度融合动态图卷积网络MS-DGCNN++，它在局部、分支和树冠尺度上使用语义上有意义的特征提取，并进行跨尺度信息传播。

Result: 在STPCTLS上达到了94.96%的精度，在FOR-species20K上达到了67.25%的精度（比MS-DGCNN提高了6.1%）。在ModelNet40和ModelNet10上，总体精度分别为93.15%和94.05%。

Conclusion: MS-DGCNN++在树种分类和3D对象识别方面表现出色，具有参数少、复杂度低的优点，适合资源受限的应用。

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.

Abstract: Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to
benchmark this dataset that integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with
contextual metadata. We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven
architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

### [44] [Funnel-HOI: Top-Down Perception for Zero-Shot HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12628)
*Sandipan Sarma,Agney Talwarr,Arijit Sur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Funnel-HOI, a top-down framework that anticipates HOI-specific cues at the encoder stage using a novel asymmetric co-attention mechanism and a novel loss function. It achieves state-of-the-art results on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets, especially for unseen and rare HOI categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Since there could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene interpretation.

Method: a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information (incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.

Result: state-of-the-art performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI categories, respectively.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI categories, respectively.

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogNVS使用3D重建和视频扩散模型，以零样本方式合成单目视频动态场景的新视角，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索单目视频动态场景的新视角合成。先前的方法依赖于昂贵的4D表示的测试时优化，或者在以前馈方式训练时无法保留场景几何。

Method: 基于三个关键见解：(1) 通过重建动态3D场景并从新视角渲染重建来渲染共视像素；(2) 使用前馈2D视频扩散模型“修复”新视角中的隐藏像素；(3) CogNVS可以通过测试时微调以零样本方式应用于新的测试视频。

Result: CogNVS优于几乎所有先前用于单目视频动态场景新视角合成的技术。

Conclusion: CogNVS在单目视频动态场景的新视角合成方面优于几乎所有现有技术。

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究结合视网膜微血管成像和血清脂质组学，旨在寻找心血管疾病的早期生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病（CVD）仍然是全球主要的死亡原因，然而目前的风险分层方法通常不能检测到早期的、亚临床的变化。以往的研究通常没有将视网膜微血管特征与全面的血清脂质组学特征相结合，作为CVD风险的潜在指标。

Method: 结合了基于深度学习图像处理的视网膜微血管特征与血清脂质组学数据

Result: 建立了强大的、与年龄和性别无关的关联，特别是在平均动脉宽度、血管密度和脂质亚类如三酰甘油（TAGs）、二酰甘油（DAGs）和神经酰胺（Cers）之间。这些关联表明在代谢压力下微血管重塑的趋同机制。

Conclusion: 通过将详细的血管结构表型与特定的脂质种类联系起来，填补了在理解早期CVD发病机制中的一个关键空白。这种整合不仅为微血管代谢关联提供了一个新的视角，而且为识别稳健的、非侵入性的生物标志物提供了一个重要的机会。最终，这些发现可能支持在心血管保健中改进早期检测、有针对性的预防和个性化方法。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained

Conclusion: NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation, resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and point clouds.

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,

made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

Motivation: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) faces challenges due to multi-scale structural heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches struggle with morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in UMIS.

Method: The paper proposes Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state space modeling for UMIS. It frames multi-contour evolution as a hierarchical state space atlas and introduces a snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB).

Conclusion: Mamba Snake achieves superior performance on five clinical datasets, with an average Dice improvement of 3% over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

feature matching, achieving 82.9\% target coverage. These results confirm the

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的与任务无关的动作范式，并引入了ATARA框架和AnyPos模型，以提高VLA模型在复杂操作任务中的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型严重依赖于特定任务的人工演示，限制了它们的泛化能力，并导致高昂的数据采集成本。

Method: 提出了ATARA，一个可扩展的自监督框架，以及AnyPos，一个配备了Arm-Decoupled Estimation和Direction-Aware Decoder (DAD)的逆动力学模型，并整合了一个视频条件动作验证模块。

Result: AnyPos-ATARA pipeline在测试精度上提高了51%，并在下游任务（如抬起、拾取和放置以及点击）中实现了30-40%的成功率提升。

Conclusion: AnyPos-ATARA pipeline显著提高了测试精度，并在下游任务中实现了更高的成功率。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

TL;DR: ReToM, a novel token merging strategy, balances visual quality and computational efficiency in image generation by merging tokens based on contextual information and using representative tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stable diffusion's time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods improve efficiency but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image generation models, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: local representative token guided merging (ReToM)

Result: ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.

Conclusion: ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 将transformer模块集成到用于计算机视觉的紧凑型神经架构中，从而产生了各种高效的视觉transformer。

Method: Transformer with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer

Result: KCR-Transformer减少了视觉transformer的FLOP，同时保持甚至提高了预测精度。

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer在各种计算机视觉任务上实现了卓越的性能，甚至比原始模型具有更好的性能，同时具有更少的 FLOP 和参数。

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 构建了首个多域感知户外场景理解数据集SVM-City，并设计了名为City-VLM的LVLM，通过构建联合概率分布空间实现多模态融合，实验结果表明City-VLM在户外场景理解任务中优于现有LVLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的用于场景理解的大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）主要集中于室内家庭任务，当应用于室外大型场景理解时，它们面临两个重要的限制。首先，室外场景通常包含通过来自多个视点的各种传感器（例如，鸟瞰图和地面视图）观察到的大规模环境，而现有的室内LVLM主要分析来自类人视点的建筑物规模环境中的单个视觉模态。其次，现有的LVLM缺乏多域感知户外数据，并且难以有效地整合2D和3D视觉信息。

Method: 构建联合概率分布空间，而不是直接实现显式融合操作（例如，连接）来实现多模态融合。引入不完全多模态学习来建模户外场景理解，并设计名为City-VLM的LVLM。

Result: City-VLM在三个典型的户外场景理解任务上的实验结果表明，在问答任务中，City-VLM的性能平均超过现有LVLM 18.14%。

Conclusion: City-VLM在问答任务中平均超过现有LVLM 18.14%的性能，并在多个户外场景中展示了实用性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

TL;DR: DeQA-Doc是一种基于MLLM的文档质量评估框架，它优于现有方法，并在各种降级类型中提供准确且可推广的文档质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档质量评估对于包括文档数字化、OCR和存档在内的广泛应用至关重要。然而，现有的方法通常难以提供准确和稳健的质量分数，限制了它们在实际场景中的适用性。随着多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）的快速发展，最近基于MLLM的方法在图像质量评估方面取得了显著的性能。

Method: 我们提出了DeQA-Doc，这是一个利用MLLM的视觉语言能力和软标签策略来回归连续文档质量分数的框架。为了使DeQA-Score适应DeQA-Doc，我们采用了两种互补的解决方案来构建没有方差信息的软标签。此外，我们放宽了分辨率约束，以支持文档图像的大分辨率。最后，我们引入了集成方法来进一步提高性能。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，DeQA-Doc显著优于现有的基线，可在各种降级类型中提供准确且可推广的文档质量评估。

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc显著优于现有基线，可在各种降级类型中提供准确且可推广的文档质量评估。

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

*Yufei Peng,Yonggang Zhang,Yiu-ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sage, a semantic-guided fine-tuning method, enhances visual-textual alignment and addresses prediction bias in long-tailed learning using foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder, overlooking the visual and textual alignment. The inconsistent class-conditional distributions are neglected by the existing loss function, the resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.

Method: A novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process. It introduces an SG-Adapter and a distribution mismatch-aware compensation factor.

Result: The introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the alignment between the visual and textual modalities. The distribution mismatch-aware compensation factor is specifically designed to rectify the prediction bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on theoretical analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function.

Conclusion: The proposed Sage method enhances performance in long-tailed learning, as demonstrated by experiments on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FIQ, a new method for video question answering that generates Q&A pairs from video descriptions to improve the model's understanding and reasoning abilities. FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics of video content, but these annotations are typically event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each video. The absence of essential details restricts the model to learning only a fragmented scene representation, which limits the model's capacity for generalization and higher-level reasoning.

Method: A novel approach called fundamental question generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question answering (FIQ). It generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the training data with fundamental scene information. Also incorporate a VQ-CAlign module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features.

Result: FIQ enhances the understanding of videos, leading to enhanced generalizability and reasoning ability.

Conclusion: The FIQ model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset.

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing

TL;DR: MCoT-RE is a training-free zero-shot CIR framework that utilizes multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual context. This approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context of the reference image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal interaction. methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text, without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference image

Method: multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with re-ranking (MCoT-RE)

Result: achieves state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR

Conclusion: MCoT-RE achieves state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods typically adopt either early or late fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens.

Method: FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation, integrating two complementary modules: ESAM and ARM.

Result: Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FAR-Net provides a robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on
widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

TL;DR: SRE reduces domain shift by aligning attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing, achieving better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP often struggles to focus on task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains.

Method: an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data.

Result: SRE generally achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SRE achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

TL;DR: This paper introduces SCORE, a framework for open-vocabulary remote sensing instance segmentation that integrates multi-granularity scene context to improve performance on challenging remote sensing data. The method achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are limited in recognizing novel categories or generalizing across datasets, restricting their applicability in diverse Earth observation scenarios. Direct application of current OV segmentation models to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects.

Method: The paper proposes SCORE, a framework that integrates multi-granularity scene context (regional and global) to enhance visual and textual representations. Region-Aware Integration refines class embeddings with regional context, and Global Context Adaptation enriches text embeddings with global context.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on new benchmarks for open-vocabulary remote sensing instance segmentation across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and provides a robust solution for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis.

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRSeg is proposed to address the low perceptual resolution issue in reasoning segmentation by using HRP and HRE modules, achieving better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning segmentation approaches are constrained by low perceptual resolution, and simply interpolating positional embeddings yields only marginal performance improvements with substantial computational costs.

Method: The paper proposes HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception, featuring High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE) modules.

Result: Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules.

Conclusion: HRSeg achieves superior performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的、用户无感知的、基于摄像头的实时情感识别方法，通过整合注视模式与环境语义和时间动态来克服现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于显式信号（如面部表情、语音或手势），这些信号仅反映身体反应，忽略了环境背景的影响，并且容易被掩盖，生理信号方法需要复杂的传感器，会影响自然行为和限制可扩展性，基于注视的方法通常依赖于静态注视分析，无法捕捉注视和环境之间丰富的动态交互。

Method: 该方法集成了注视模式与环境语义和时间动态，利用标准高清摄像头，非侵入式地捕捉用户在自然环境中的眼睛外观和头部运动，估计随时间和空间变化的注视轨迹，从而对注视行为的空间、语义和时间维度进行建模。

Result: 该方法能够捕捉视觉注意力和周围环境之间的动态相互作用，揭示情绪不仅仅是生理反应，而是人与环境互动产生的复杂结果。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的基于摄像头的、用户无感知的的情感识别方法，该方法具有高泛化性和低部署成本，能够实现用户无感知、实时和连续的情感识别。

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的车道检测性能评估框架，无需ground truth标签，并在各种领域偏移下表现出色，从而提高了ADAS的效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域转移通常会削弱部署在新环境中的模型可靠性。确保车道检测模型的鲁棒性和安全性通常需要收集和标注目标领域数据，这需要耗费大量资源。在车道检测中，在没有地面真实标签的情况下估计模型性能是一种有效的鲁棒性评估方法，但尚未得到充分探索。以往的工作已经解决了图像分类中的性能估计问题，但这些方法并不直接适用于车道检测任务。

Method: 该论文首先将五种表现良好的图像分类性能估计方法调整为车道检测，构建了一个基线。然后，提出了一个新的车道性能估计框架（LanePerf），该框架集成了图像和车道特征，使用预训练的图像编码器和基于DeepSets的架构。

Result: 在OpenLane数据集上的大量实验表明，LanePerf优于所有基线，实现了0.117的较低MAE和0.727的较高Spearman等级相关系数。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的车道性能估计框架（LanePerf），该框架优于所有基线，为ADAS中稳健、无标签的性能估计铺平了道路，支持更高效的测试和在具有挑战性的驾驶场景中提高安全性。

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的Fed-Cyclic和Fed-Star算法在新数据集上优于现有基线。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear reliability for sports tasks.

Method: Using the AthleticsPose dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and performed a comprehensive evaluation.

Result: the model trained on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. Estimation accuracy is sensitive to camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity, due to prediction biases.

Conclusion: This work provides the research community with a valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a

TL;DR: Argus, a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model, enhances 3D scene understanding by fusing multi-view images and 3D point clouds, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely heavily on 3D point clouds, which often result in information loss due to omissions in textureless planes or repetitive patterns, and distortion of details in complex structures. 2D multi-view images can compensate for these deficiencies.

Method: A novel 3D multimodal framework (Argus) is proposed, which fuses multi-view images and camera poses into view-as-scene features, interacting with 3D features to create comprehensive 3D-aware scene embeddings.

Result: Argus compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and helps LLMs better understand the 3D world.

Conclusion: The proposed Argus framework outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks by leveraging multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs.

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

*Dongyeun Lee,Jiwan Hur,Hyounguk Shon,Jae Young Lee,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DMQ, a quantization method for diffusion models that uses learned scaling and timestep weighting to improve performance at low bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing post-training quantization (PTQ) methods often overlook outliers, leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths.

Method: DMQ combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to address the challenges of quantizing diffusion models. It incorporates an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to prioritize critical early denoising steps and introduces channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations in layers with high inter-channel variance. A voting algorithm is used to ensure robust selection of PTS factors.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image generation quality and model stability.

Conclusion: DMQ outperforms existing methods, especially at low bit-widths such as W4A6 and W4A8, maintaining high image generation quality and model stability.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

Conclusion: This paper uses a weakly supervised cross-modal person ReID method and achieves good results.

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Senqiao Yang,Junyi Li,Xin Lai,Bei Yu,Hengshuang Zhao,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionThink dynamically adjusts image resolution for VLMs, using high resolution only when needed, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that while increasing visual tokens improves VLM performance, most real-world scenarios don't need many visual tokens. Performance drops in OCR tasks when using fewer tokens, but general VQA tasks remain accurate even with lower resolution.

Method: The paper proposes VisionThink, a new paradigm for visual token compression that dynamically processes distinct samples with different resolutions. It uses reinforcement learning and an LLM-as-Judge strategy to apply RL to general VQA tasks, along with a carefully designed reward function and penalty mechanism.

Result: VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case, demonstrating strong fine-grained visual understanding on OCR-related tasks and saving visual tokens on simpler tasks. The method shows superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness in experiments.

Conclusion: The VisionThink method demonstrates superior performance, efficiency, and effectiveness through extensive experiments. It achieves strong fine-grained visual understanding on OCR-related tasks while saving substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出MUPM模型来解决MLLM中多模态数据的不确定性问题，该模型具有良好的泛化能力和临床应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）可以处理和整合来自多模态来源（如文本和图像）的信息。然而，大规模MLLM背景下，输入模态间的相互关系、单模态数据的不确定性以及不确定性分解后的潜在临床应用尚未完全理解。

Method: 提出了一种基于不确定性传播的多模态不确定性传播模型（MUPM），用于表征MLLM输入中图像、文本和联合图像-文本变异引起的不确定性之间的关系。

Result: MUPM模型可以用少量样本进行鲁棒优化，并且可以在不同的输入数据分布和不同的下游任务中推广。这种可迁移性可能是由于共享的预训练、相对较轻的MLLM微调以及MUPM模型的低维特性。

Conclusion: MUPM模型学习到的不确定性关系具有迁移性，可用于临床应用，例如估计和分析不同数据或新的心脏疾病预测任务中的不确定性。此外，MUPM模型在估计整体不确定性和识别冗余因素方面效率高，这在临床上很有用。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

Motivation: Scaling diffusion transformers (DiTs) to long-duration video generation is challenging due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention, and prior efforts often compromise temporal coherence or scalability.

Conclusion: The paper introduces LoViC, a DiT-based framework capable of generating long, coherent videos through segment-wise generation, and validates its effectiveness and versatility across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse

Motivation: fine-tuning regularization parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often requiring multiple training iterations

Result: cIDIR models a continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced regularization techniques via automatic differentiation

Conclusion: cIDIR achieves high accuracy and robustness across the DIR-LAB dataset.

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从静态图像生成富有表现力的面部动画是一项具有挑战性的任务。先前依赖于显式几何先验（例如，面部标志或 3DMM）的方法经常遭受交叉重演中的伪影，并且难以捕捉细微的情绪。此外，现有方法缺乏对多角色动画的支持，因为来自不同个体的驱动特征经常相互干扰，从而使任务复杂化。

Method: 基于扩散转换器的框架，它采用了一种增强表情的学习策略，该策略利用隐式表示来捕获与身份无关的面部动态，从而增强了模型渲染细微表情的能力。对于多角色控制，设计了一种屏蔽交叉注意机制，可确保独立但协调的表情生成，从而有效防止特征干扰。

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait在定量指标和定性评估方面均显著优于最先进的方法，尤其是在具有挑战性的交叉重演和多角色上下文中表现出色。

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: estimating the unobservable feature, which encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging sensors. capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning

Method: extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM

Result: achieves state-of-the-art performance

Conclusion: achieves state-of-the-art performance on SR and downstream relighting tasks

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越来越昂贵的训练成本促使人们重复利用大量已训练的先进网络。然而，它们的延迟、高计算成本和内存需求对部署提出了重大挑战，尤其是在资源受限的硬件上。虽然结构化剪枝方法可以减少这些因素，但它们通常需要昂贵的再训练，有时甚至需要数百个 epoch，或者从头开始训练，以恢复结构修改导致的精度损失。在结构化剪枝后保持已训练模型的性能，从而避免大量的再训练仍然是一个挑战。

Method: Variance-Based Pruning，一种简单且结构化的单次修剪技术

Result: 在 ImageNet-1k 识别任务中，直接修剪后，DeiT-Base 保留了其原始性能的 70% 以上，并且只需要 10 个 epoch 的微调即可恢复 99% 的原始精度，同时将 MAC 减少 35%，模型大小减少 36%，从而将模型速度提高 1.44 倍。

Conclusion: Variance-Based Pruning 可以有效地压缩网络，只需最少的微调。在 ImageNet-1k 识别任务中，直接修剪后，DeiT-Base 保留了其原始性能的 70% 以上，并且只需要 10 个 epoch 的微调即可恢复 99% 的原始精度，同时将 MAC 减少 35%，模型大小减少 36%，从而将模型速度提高 1.44 倍。

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

Motivation: 基于对比学习的多模态模型取得了显著成功，这主要得益于在规模越来越大的数据集上进行训练，而这需要消耗大量的计算资源。样本选择作为一种替代的有效范例，是加速训练过程的一个重要方向。然而，最近在样本选择方面的进展要么主要依赖于预言模型来离线选择高质量的核集，这在冷启动场景中受到限制，要么侧重于基于实时模型预测的在线选择，但没有充分或有效地考虑噪声对应关系。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的差分信息样本选择 (DISSect) 方法，该方法准确有效地辨别噪声对应关系以加速训练。

Result: 当前模型和历史模型的预测相关性之间的差异更能表征样本质量。基于此，我们构建了一个鲁棒的基于差异的样本选择，并分析了其理论见解。

Conclusion: DISSect在三个基准数据集和各种下游任务上的大量实验表明，相对于当前最先进的方法，DISSect 具有一致的优越性。

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于深度学习的图像篡改定位（IML）方法近年来取得了显著的性能，但通常依赖于大规模的像素级注释数据集。为了解决获取高质量注释的挑战，最近的一些弱监督方法利用图像级标签来分割篡改区域。然而，由于监督信号不足，性能仍然有限。

Method: 我们采用具有结构一致性损失的自监督训练，以鼓励模型在多尺度和增强输入下产生一致的预测。此外，我们提出了一个先验感知特征调制模块（PFMM），该模块自适应地整合来自操纵和真实区域的先验信息，以进行动态特征调整，进一步增强复杂场景中的特征可区分性和预测一致性。我们还提出了一个门控自适应融合模块（GAFM），该模块利用门控机制来调节特征融合期间的信息流，引导模型强调潜在的篡改区域。最后，我们提出了一个置信度感知熵最小化损失（${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$）。

Result: 我们重新用涂鸦标签注释了主流的IML数据集，并提出了第一个基于涂鸦的IML（Sc-IML）数据集。此外，我们提出了第一个基于涂鸦的弱监督IML框架。

Conclusion: 该方法在平均性能方面优于现有的全监督方法，无论是在分布内还是分布外。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Conclusion: MaskGIL achieves a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models while requiring fewer inference steps. It can also generate images from text and accelerate AR-based generation.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond

Result: HCS enables VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density

Conclusion: HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various tasks.

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various

TL;DR: This paper presents a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that leverages a pre-trained detector to refine synthetic samples, improving label consistency and image quality for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset distillation aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset, but existing diffusion models often produce samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance.

Method: The method employs a pre-trained detector to identify anomalous images and uses a pre-trained diffusion model to generate candidates for defective images. The optimal candidate is selected by considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing qualified synthetic samples.

Result: The proposed method synthesizes high-quality representative images with richer details and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a detector-guided dataset distillation framework to refine anomalous synthetic samples, ensuring label consistency and improving image quality. The method synthesizes high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的运动分割方法，该方法更有效率，速度更快，参数更少，同时保持了相当的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶等安全关键型机器人应用中，实时准确地检测所有需要的物体非常重要。运动分割提供了一种解决方案，通过以类别无关的方式识别场景中的动态物体。最近，已经提出了各种运动分割模型，其中大多数模型共同使用子网络来估计深度、姿态、光流和场景流。因此，模型的整体计算成本增加，阻碍了实时性能。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于代价体的运动特征表示，即通道式运动特征。通过提取特征图中每个实例的深度特征并捕获场景的3D运动信息，从而提高效率。构建通道式运动特征的唯一子网络是姿态网络，不需要其他网络。

Result: 提出的方法实现了最先进模型约4倍的FPS，同时保持了相当的精度，并将参数减少到约25%。

Conclusion: 该方法在KITTI数据集和VCAS-Motion数据集的Cityscapes上实现了最先进模型约4倍的FPS，同时保持了相当的精度，并将参数减少到约25%。

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled PROB通过引入ETOP和TDQI解决了PROB在开放世界目标检测中对象性和类别预测之间的学习冲突问题，并在性能上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界对象检测（OWOD）是一项具有挑战性的计算机视觉任务，它通过以下方式扩展了标准对象检测：（1）在没有监督的情况下检测和分类未知对象，以及（2）在不忘记先前学习的对象类别的情况下增量学习新的对象类别。缺乏未知对象的真值使得OWOD任务特别具有挑战性。许多方法通过对未知对象使用伪标签来解决这个问题。最近提出的基于概率对象性Transformer的开放世界检测器（PROB）是一种不需要未知对象的伪标签的最新模型，因为它预测概率对象性。然而，这种方法面临着对象性和类别预测之间的学习冲突问题。

Method: Decoupled PROB引入了对象性预测的早期终止（ETOP）以停止解码器中适当层的对象性预测，解决了PROB中类和对象性预测之间的学习冲突。此外，我们还引入了任务解耦查询初始化（TDQI），它可以有效地提取已知和未知对象的特征，从而提高性能。TDQI是一种结合了查询选择和可学习查询的查询初始化方法，并且是一个可以轻松集成到现有基于DETR的OWOD模型中的模块。

Result: 在OWOD基准上的大量实验表明，Decoupled PROB超越了所有现有方法，并在多个指标上显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB显著超越了现有方法，并在多个指标上显著提高了性能。

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

TL;DR: DINO-VO, a feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model, demonstrates greater robustness and outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods. It also performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor driving scenarios, while running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness, generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains limited due to coarse feature granularity.

Method: a salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features, a transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer

Result: DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor driving scenarios

Conclusion: DINO-VO demonstrates greater robustness in challenging environments and outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on the TartanAir and KITTI datasets. It also performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor driving scenarios.

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single

*Han Zhang,Xiangde Luo,Yong Chen,Kang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffOSeg, a two-stage diffusion model, addresses annotation variability in medical image segmentation by achieving both consensus and preference-driven segmentation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotation variability in medical image segmentation due to ambiguous boundaries and diverse expertise leads to failure of traditional deep learning methods. Existing multi-rater segmentation methods lack an omni view by focusing on either consensus or individual preferences.

Method: A two-stage diffusion-based framework, DiffOSeg, with a probabilistic consensus strategy in Stage I and adaptive prompts for expert-specific preference capture in Stage II.

Result: The model achieves both consensus-driven and preference-driven segmentation, demonstrated on LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DiffOSeg model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics on two public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170).

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于多模态LLM的自进化VLN框架(SE-VLN)，它包含分层记忆模块、检索增强的基于思想的推理模块和反思模块，在R2R和REVERSE数据集上显著优于当前最优方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言导航(VLN)方法受到大型语言模型(llm)固定知识库和推理能力的限制，无法充分整合经验知识，从而导致缺乏有效的进化能力。

Method: 提出了一个自进化的VLN框架(SE-VLN)，以使VLN代理能够在测试过程中不断进化。SE-VLN包括三个核心模块：分层记忆模块，用于将成功和失败的案例转移到可重用的知识中；检索增强的基于思想的推理模块，用于检索经验并实现多步骤决策；以及一个反思模块，以实现持续进化。

Result: SE-VLN在未见过的环境中实现了57%和35.2%的导航成功率，在R2R和REVERSE数据集上分别比当前最先进的方法提高了23.9%和15.0%。

Conclusion: SE-VLN在R2R和REVERSE数据集上分别实现了57%和35.2%的导航成功率，相比当前最先进的方法分别提高了23.9%和15.0%。随着经验库的增加，SE-VLN的性能有所提高，阐明了其作为VLN自进化代理框架的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GLAD，一种通过梯度正则化LoRA调整来提升模型在少样本学习场景中的泛化能力的框架，并在15个数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示调整方法面临两个主要挑战：（1）在少样本情况下，数据稀缺通常导致过拟合，使得模型对输入域的变化敏感。（2）为了缓解过拟合，这些方法通常依赖于复杂的特定任务模型架构和敏感的超参数调整，严重限制了它们的一般适用性。

Method: 提出了一个更简单和通用的框架，称为GLAD（具有正则化梯度的可泛化LoRA调整）。仅仅应用LoRA就能在下游任务中实现与当前最先进的基于提示的方法相当的性能。引入了一种基于梯度的正则化技术，有效地引导优化轨迹，鼓励模型找到一个对数据分布变化更鲁棒的更稳定的参数区域。

Result: 仅仅应用LoRA就能在下游任务中实现与当前最先进的基于提示的方法相当的性能。通过在15个基准数据集上进行的大量实验证明，GLAD在基类到新类的泛化、图像域泛化和跨数据集泛化方面优于之前的调整方法。

Conclusion: GLAD在泛化能力上优于之前的调整方法，通过在15个基准数据集上进行的大量实验证明了这一点，包括基类到新类的泛化、图像域泛化和跨数据集泛化。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

Result: The segmentation model demonstrated robust performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two.

Conclusion: A fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity assessment and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual

generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic

Conclusion: 该方法在对象级别和点级别的异常检测方面均实现了最先进的性能，即使仅使用原始特征。

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

Conclusion: S^2M^2在Middlebury v3和ETH3D基准测试中建立了新的技术水平，在大多数指标上显著优于先前的方法，同时以具有竞争力的效率重建高质量的细节。

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior is essential for developing autonomous vehicle technology. Previous works have limitations in operational-level yielding dynamics, tactical decision modeling, limited action sets, or payoff functions.

Method: game theoretic model for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions coupled with an underlying dynamics model

Result: The model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions and adequate computation time efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when validated on a real-world dataset and confirmed to have adequate computation time efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle development.

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

Conclusion: Identifies needs for the field of XRL.

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

Motivation: 游戏设计的关键在于理解静态规则和内容如何转化为动态的玩家行为，而现代生成系统在检查游戏代码或资源时难以捕捉到这一点。

Method: 配对一个强化学习(RL) agent (负责游戏测试) 和一个大型多模态模型(LMM) (根据agent的行为修改游戏)。

Result: LMMs可以根据RL agents提供的行为轨迹进行推理，从而迭代地改进游戏机制。

Conclusion: LMMs可以根据RL agents提供的行为轨迹进行推理，从而迭代地改进游戏机制，为AI辅助游戏设计提供实用的、可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It's unclear how effective deception probes are at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade detection.

Method: Compare white-box monitoring (with access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without such access). Benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor.

Result: Find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance boosts from existing deception probes.

Conclusion: Existing deception probes show weak but encouraging black-to-white performance boosts.

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

Motivation: Peer learning promotes spontaneous thinking, but effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency levels, which is not always feasible between humans.

Method: Developing an AI Agent as a learning companion focusing on English composition.

Result: The study validates the approach.

Conclusion: This study validates the approach of using AI agents as learning companions in English composition, assuming learners with similar proficiency make similar mistakes.

Abstract: In recent years, peer learning has gained attention as a method that promotes
spontaneous thinking among learners, and its effectiveness has been confirmed
by numerous studies. This study aims to develop an AI Agent as a learning
companion that enables peer learning anytime and anywhere. However, peer
learning between humans has various limitations, and it is not always
effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency
levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same
proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation method for AI world models based on novel games to promote rapid adaptation and generalization, inspired by human cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI world models lack the rapid adaptation and efficient learning seen in human intelligence, focusing instead on static representations from massive datasets. The profound adaptability of human intelligence is linked to the efficient construction and refinement of internal representations of the environment.

Method: The paper proposes a novel benchmarking paradigm using suites of carefully designed games with genuine, deep, and continually refreshing novelty in the underlying game structures. It details key desiderata for constructing these games and proposes appropriate metrics.

Result: The paper does not present specific experimental results but proposes a new evaluation framework and benchmarking paradigm.

Conclusion: This paper advocates for a new evaluation framework for AI world models, emphasizing rapid adaptation and generalization in novel environments, drawing inspiration from human cognitive science.

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

*Hussein Abbass,Taylan Akay,Harrison Tolley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for dynamically weighting ethical decisions in AI simulations, using techniques from multi-criteria decision making to automate the weighting of ethical attributes and reduce the need for constant human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human judgement is counter-productive and infeasible for exploring a large number of scenarios with ethical consequences in AI simulations. This paper aims to move human judgement outside the simulation decision cycle by having humans design the ethical metric space and the simulation environment explore it.

Method: The paper uses different approaches from the multi-criteria decision making literature to automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during simulation-based testing.

Result: The simulation environment provides the human commander with a few options to select from after completing its testing cycles, allowing the commander to exercise human judgement in choosing the most appropriate course of action.

Conclusion: The paper explores how to dynamically weight ethical attributes during simulation-based testing and evaluation by drawing from multi-criteria decision making literature, particularly using the concept of entropy to determine weights during aggregation.

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种将操纵风险纳入人工智能安全治理的系统方法，为人工智能公司在部署前评估和降低这些威胁奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

TL;DR: VAR-MATH: a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability, reveals that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmark contamination and evaluation fragility in existing protocols. Public availability of test problems increases the risk of data leakage. Reliance on single-instance assessments are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency.

Method: Introduce VAR-MATH, a symbolic evaluation framework. Convert fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and require models to solve multiple instantiations of each.

Result: RL-trained models on the variabilized versions reveal substantial performance drops, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0% on AMC23 and 58.3% on AIME24.

Conclusion: Existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. VAR-MATH offers a principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

Result: The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates how the translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's capabilities.

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

Motivation: 现代语言模型通过思维链 (CoT) 推理和检索增强来解决复杂问题，但存在错误传播和知识集成问题。树状结构推理方法，特别是概率树 (ProbTree) 框架，通过将问题分解为层次结构并通过参数和检索知识的置信度加权聚合来选择答案，从而缓解了这些问题。然而，ProbTree 的静态实现在初始构建阶段存在推理树是固定的，阻止了对中间结果的动态适应，以及每个节点都需要详尽评估所有可能的解决方案策略，从而导致计算效率低下这两个关键限制。

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

### [126] [Black Box Deployed -- Functional Criteria for Artificial Moral Agents in the LLM Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13175)
*Matthew E. Brophy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文认为，由于大型语言模型（LLM）的出现，传统的道德评估标准已经过时，并提出了十项新的功能标准，以评估基于LLM的人工道德主体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM的随机输出和不透明的内部状态，LLM违背了透明架构的假设，因此传统的伦理标准在实践上已过时。

Method: 通过涉及自动驾驶公共巴士（APB）的假设场景来说明这些标准，以证明它们在道德上显着背景下的实际适用性。

Result: 传统伦理标准在实践上已过时，因为强大但不透明的大型语言模型（LLM）的进步需要对用于评估人工道德主体（AMA）的哲学标准进行根本性的修改。

Conclusion: 提出了修订后的十项功能标准，以评估基于LLM的人工道德主体，旨在引导AMAs在未来几年实现更大程度的对齐和有益的社会融合。

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于高阶模式的合一算法，该算法在相似关系下是模的，并证明了其终止性、可靠性和完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高阶理论和模糊逻辑的结合在涉及跨抽象函数和谓词进行推理的决策任务中非常有用，在这些任务中，精确匹配通常很少见或不必要。为这种组合形式主义开发有效的推理和计算技术提出了一个重大挑战。

Method: 我们采用了一种更直接的方法，旨在整合两个已建立的且计算良好的组件：一侧是高阶模式，另一侧是基于最小 T 范数通过相似关系表达的模糊等价性。

Result: 该算法计算出具有最高近似度的最一般合一器。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一个高阶模式的合一算法，该算法以这些相似关系为模，并证明了它的终止性、可靠性和完整性。这个合一问题，就像它清晰的对应问题一样，是单元的。当给定项是可合一时，该算法计算出具有最高近似度的最一般合一器。

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

### [128] [The Generative Energy Arena (GEA): Incorporating Energy Awareness in Large Language Model (LLM) Human Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13302)
*Carlos Arriaga,Gonzalo Martínez,Eneko Sendin,Javier Conde,Pedro Reviriego*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces GEA, an arena for evaluating LLMs with energy consumption awareness, finding users prefer energy-efficient models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating energy awareness influence on human decisions in selecting LLMs due to the increasing importance of LLMs' energy consumption.

Method: Presents GEA (Generative Energy Arena), an arena incorporating energy consumption information into the evaluation process.

Result: Preliminary GEA results show users favor smaller, more energy-efficient models when aware of energy consumption.

Conclusion: Users favor smaller, more energy-efficient models when aware of energy consumption, suggesting the energy cost of complex models doesn't justify their use for most interactions.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FormulaOne, a benchmark for evaluating AI models on real-life research problems in graph theory, logic, and algorithms. State-of-the-art models fail on this benchmark, highlighting their limitations in expert-level understanding. The authors release the dataset and evaluation framework to support further research.

Motivation: To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on real-life research problems.

Method: We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of frontier models. The dataset has three key properties: commercial interest, generated from Monadic Second-Order (MSO) logic on graphs, and related to the frontier of theoretical computer science.

Conclusion: State-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from expert-level understanding in some domains.

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for transforming football data into object-centric event logs, providing a real-world example and suggesting future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The number of real-world object-centric event logs remains limited, and further studies are needed to test their usefulness. The increasing availability of data from team sports can facilitate object-centric process mining, leveraging both real-world data and suitable use cases.

Method: A framework for transforming football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, further enhanced with a spatial dimension.

Result: The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated by generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data, and the results are discussed for varying process representations.

Conclusion: This paper provides the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics and suggests future work on variant analysis and filtering techniques.

Abstract: Object-centric event logs expand the conventional single-case notion event
log by considering multiple objects, allowing for the analysis of more complex
and realistic process behavior. However, the number of real-world
object-centric event logs remains limited, and further studies are needed to
test their usefulness. The increasing availability of data from team sports can
facilitate object-centric process mining, leveraging both real-world data and
suitable use cases. In this paper, we present a framework for transforming
football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, further enhanced with
a spatial dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data and
discuss the results for varying process representations. With our paper, we
provide the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics.
Future work should consider variant analysis and filtering techniques to better
handle variability

Conclusion: rel-HNN在分类和回归任务中显著优于现有方法，并且split-parallel训练实现了显着加速。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world
applications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models
that rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics
from the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs)
have been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational
structures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring
intra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based
framework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair
as a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained
intra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level
representations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the
scalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a
split-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for
efficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and
benchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing
methods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our
split-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for
learning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared
to conventional single-GPU execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerous studies treat temporal events as single time points, neglecting their durations. Mining all patterns is computationally challenging and resource-intensive. Targeting the extraction of time-interval-related patterns based on specific criteria can improve data analysis efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes a novel algorithm called TaTIRP to discover Targeted Time-Interval Related Patterns and develops multiple pruning strategies to eliminate redundant extension operations.

Result: The proposed pruning strategies enhance performance on large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: The paper conducts experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed TaTIRP algorithm.

Abstract: Compared to frequent pattern mining, sequential pattern mining emphasizes the
temporal aspect and finds broad applications across various fields. However,
numerous studies treat temporal events as single time points, neglecting their
durations. Time-interval-related pattern (TIRP) mining is introduced to address
this issue and has been applied to healthcare analytics, stock prediction, etc.
Typically, mining all patterns is not only computationally challenging for
accurate forecasting but also resource-intensive in terms of time and memory.
Targeting the extraction of time-interval-related patterns based on specific
criteria can improve data analysis efficiency and better align with customer
preferences. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called TaTIRP to
discover Targeted Time-Interval Related Patterns. Additionally, we develop
multiple pruning strategies to eliminate redundant extension operations,
thereby enhancing performance on large-scale datasets. Finally, we conduct
experiments on various real-world and synthetic datasets to validate the
accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: VaxPulse Query Corner, a tool using Retrieval Augmented Generation, effectively addresses complex queries about public vaccine concerns on social media, achieving high answer faithfulness and relevance.

Abstract: Vaccine hesitancy threatens public health, leading to delayed or rejected
vaccines. Social media is a vital source for understanding public concerns, and
traditional methods like topic modelling often struggle to capture nuanced
opinions. Though trained for query answering, large Language Models (LLMs)
often miss current events and community concerns. Additionally, hallucinations
in LLMs can compromise public health communication. To address these
limitations, we developed a tool (VaxPulse Query Corner) using the Retrieval
Augmented Generation technique. It addresses complex queries about public
vaccine concerns on various online platforms, aiding public health
administrators and stakeholders in understanding public concerns and
implementing targeted interventions to boost vaccine confidence. Analysing

Abstract: Autonomous multimodal language models are rapidly evolving into web agents
that can browse, click, and purchase items on behalf of users, posing a threat
to display advertising designed for human eyes. Yet little is known about how
these agents interact with ads or which design principles ensure reliable
engagement. To address this, we ran a controlled experiment using a faithful
clone of the news site TT.com, seeded with diverse ads: static banners, GIFs,
carousels, videos, cookie dialogues, and paywalls. We ran 300 initial trials
plus follow-ups using the Document Object Model (DOM)-centric Browser Use
framework with GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and the pixel-based
OpenAI Operator, across 10 realistic user tasks. Our results show these agents
display severe satisficing: they never scroll beyond two viewports and ignore
purely visual calls to action, clicking banners only when semantic button
overlays or off-screen text labels are present. Critically, when sweepstake
participation required a purchase, GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet subscribed in
100% of trials, and Gemini 2.0 Flash in 70%, revealing gaps in cost-benefit
analysis. We identified five actionable design principles-semantic overlays,
hidden labels, top-left placement, static frames, and dialogue replacement,
that make human-centric creatives machine-detectable without harming user
experience. We also evaluated agent trustworthiness through "behavior patterns"
such as cookie consent handling and subscription choices, highlighting
model-specific risk boundaries and the urgent need for robust trust evaluation
frameworks in real-world advertising.

TL;DR: GMC is a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target cross-domain recommendation that uses semantically quantized discrete item identifiers to integrate multi-domain knowledge. It outperforms baselines on five datasets.

Motivation: Existing MTCDR methods rely on domain-shared entities, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped scenarios. Some studies require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training. Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area.

Method: GMC leverages semantically quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain knowledge within a unified generative model. It employs an item tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers and formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task. A domain-aware contrastive loss and domain-specific fine-tuning are incorporated.

Result: GMC demonstrates effectiveness compared to a range of baseline methods on five public datasets.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline methods.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain
Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across
multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on
domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain
knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios.
Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable
semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task.
Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training.
Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for
further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper
introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target
cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically
quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain
knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item
tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and
then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training
a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain
information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive
loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific
fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline
methods.

Conclusion: SGCL在三个真实世界的数据集上优于最先进的方法，实现了卓越的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) are essential for online platforms, providing
personalized suggestions to users within a vast sea of information.
Self-supervised graph learning seeks to harness high-order collaborative
filtering signals through unsupervised augmentation on the user-item bipartite
graph, primarily leveraging a multi-task learning framework that includes both
supervised recommendation loss and self-supervised contrastive loss. However,
this separate design introduces additional graph convolution processes and
creates inconsistencies in gradient directions due to disparate losses,
resulting in prolonged training times and sub-optimal performance. In this
study, we introduce a unified framework of Supervised Graph Contrastive
Learning for recommendation (SGCL) to address these issues. SGCL uniquely
combines the training of recommendation and unsupervised contrastive losses
into a cohesive supervised contrastive learning loss, aligning both tasks
within a single optimization direction for exceptionally fast training.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SGCL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency.

Method: propose a novel Parallel Multi-Knowledge Learning-based Compressor (PMKLC) with four crucial designs: 1) automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression framework; 2) a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder; 3) data block partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel acceleration; 4) two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M

Conclusion: PMKLC-S/M achieves the best robustness and competitive memory cost, indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained devices.

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale
genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their
1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1
and DeepSeek-R1 have shown that scaling test-time computation-through
chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative exploration-can yield substantial
improvements on complex tasks like mathematics and code generation. These
breakthroughs have been driven by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly when combined with verifiable reward signals that provide
objective and grounded supervision. In this report, we investigate the effects
of prolonged reinforcement learning on a small language model across a diverse
set of reasoning domains. Our work identifies several key ingredients for
effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements
to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to
improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL
regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as
critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model
achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on
math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzle tasks. To facilitate

### [139] [The Serial Scaling Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12549)
*Yuxi Liu,Konpat Preechakul,Kananart Kuwaranancharoen,Yutong Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 某些问题本质上是串行的，并行计算架构在解决这些问题时存在限制，AI 需要扩展串行计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习通过大规模并行化取得了进展，但存在一个关键盲点：有些问题本质上是串行的。这些“固有串行”问题——从数学推理到物理模拟再到序列决策——需要无法并行化的依赖计算步骤。

Method: 从复杂性理论中提取并形式化串行计算的区别，证明了当前以并行计算为中心的架构在处理这些任务时面临根本限制。

Result: 当前以并行计算为中心的架构在处理串行任务时面临根本限制。

Conclusion: AI 需要扩展串行计算以解决复杂的推理问题，而不仅仅是并行计算。

Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we
identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential.
These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical
simulations to sequential decision-making-require dependent computational steps
that cannot be parallelized. Drawing from complexity theory, we formalize this
distinction and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face
fundamental limitations on such tasks. We argue that recognizing the serial
nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model
design, hardware development. As AI tackles increasingly complex reasoning,
deliberately scaling serial computation-not just parallel computation-is
essential for continued progress.

### [140] [Can Mental Imagery Improve the Thinking Capabilities of AI Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12555)
*Slimane Larabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine thinking framework incorporating mental imagery to enhance autonomous reasoning. It integrates cognitive and auxiliary units, using natural language and sketches for data representation, and presents validation test results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack autonomous action and independent reasoning, and AI agents struggle with cross-domain knowledge integration, unlike humans who use mental imagery in their thinking process.

Method: The proposed framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit with three auxiliary units: Input Data Unit, Needs Unit, and Mental Imagery Unit. Data is represented as natural language sentences or sketches.

Result: Validation tests were conducted, and the results are presented and discussed.

Conclusion: This paper introduces and validates a machine thinking framework that integrates mental imagery to improve autonomous reasoning and decision-making.

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory
responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent
reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as
explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform
tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs,
and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle
with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process,
which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned
actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how
to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this
could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine
thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three
auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery
Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences
or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We
conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented
and discussed.

### [141] [IncA-DES: An incremental and adaptive dynamic ensemble selection approach using online K-d tree neighborhood search for data streams with concept drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12573)
*Eduardo V. L. Barboza,Paulo R. Lisboa de Almeida,Alceu de Souza Britto Jr.,Robert Sabourin,Rafael M. O. Cruz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces IncA-DES, a framework for handling concept drift in data streams using local experts, a drift detector, and an optimized kNN search, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with improved processing time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept drift in data streams poses challenges for batch-based ML. Fusion of classifiers shows promise, and instance-based DS methods are efficient but need adaptation for concept drift. Neighborhood-search DS can be prohibitive with continuous data arrival.

Method: The paper proposes IncA-DES, which uses a training strategy for local expert generation, a concept drift detector for information maintenance, and an overlap-based classification filter. An Online K-d tree algorithm is introduced to reduce kNN processing time.

Result: Experimental results show IncA-DES achieves the best average accuracy compared to seven state-of-the-art methods and has smaller processing time among the most accurate ones. The Online K-d tree improves processing time with a negligible loss in accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed IncA-DES framework achieves the best average accuracy compared to seven state-of-the-art methods, with smaller processing time among the most accurate methods. The Online K-d tree improves processing time with negligible accuracy loss. The framework is available in an online repository.

Abstract: Data streams pose challenges not usually encountered in batch-based ML. One
of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data
distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the
fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing
attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an
efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid
to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order
to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may
become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we
propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the
generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the
feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept
drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new
concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to
avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a
strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make
them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing
time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly
remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing
concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the
proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven
state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and
presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.
Additionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time
with a negligible loss in accuracy. We have made our framework available in an
online repository.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PinFM, a foundational model for understanding user activity sequences, pretrains a transformer model and fine-tunes it for specific applications. It addresses challenges in industrial recommender systems and improves throughput and user engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in recommender systems. Applying pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach in industrial recommender systems presents numerous challenges such as scalability, cost and latency constraints, capturing the interactions between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not present during the pretraining stage.

Method: pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications, efficiently coupling it with existing models. Developed innovative techniques such as the Deduplicated Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT).

Result: infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on Pinterest internal data. PinFM can learn interactions between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading to a 20% increase in engagement with new items.

Conclusion: PinFM is deployed to improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various applications.

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in
recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding
user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual
discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using
extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications,
efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this
pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as
Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents
numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score
millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints
imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions
between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not
present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our
infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated
Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on
Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions
between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading
to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help
improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Assay2Mol uses a large language model to generate drug candidates from biochemical screening assays, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured text in biochemical screening assays contains rich information for drug discovery but is untapped.

Method: A large language model-based workflow using in-context learning with retrieved assay screening data.

Result: Assay2Mol can capitalize on biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery.

Conclusion: Assay2Mol outperforms existing machine learning approaches in generating synthesizable candidate ligand molecules.

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside
descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the
functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets.
Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these
targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of
assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been
untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large
language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing
biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol
retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target
and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved
assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches
that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while
also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了排序向量的聚类问题，提出了 KRCA 算法，该算法优于基线解决方案，并在个性化和大规模决策中具有实际意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究聚类排序向量的问题，其中每个向量将偏好表示为不同整数的有序列表。具体来说，我们关注 k 中心点排序向量聚类问题 (KRC)，该问题旨在将一组排序向量划分为 k 个聚类，并识别每个聚类的中心点。与经典的 k 均值聚类 (KMC) 不同，KRC 将观察和中心点都限制为排序向量。

Method: 开发了一种有效的近似算法 KRCA，该算法迭代地改进来自 KMC 的初始解决方案（称为基线解决方案）。此外，我们还引入了一种分支定界 (BnB) 算法，用于在 KRCA 中进行高效的集群重建，利用决策树框架来减少计算时间，同时结合控制参数来平衡解决方案质量和效率。

Result: 建立了 KRC 的 NP 难度并描述了其可行集。对于单集群情况，我们推导了最优中心点的闭式解析解，可以在线性时间内计算。我们为 KRCA 和 BnB 建立了理论误差界限。

Conclusion: KRCA 算法在合成和真实世界数据集上的数值实验中始终优于基线解决方案，在快速计算时间内显着提高了解决方案质量。这项工作强调了 KRC 在个性化和大规模决策中的实际意义，提供了方法上的进步和见解，可以在未来的研究中加以利用。

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering ranking vectors, where each vector
represents preferences as an ordered list of distinct integers. Specifically,
we focus on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), which
aims to partition a set of ranking vectors into k clusters and identify the
centroid of each cluster. Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC
constrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We
establish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the
single-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the
optimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the
computational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation
algorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred
to as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound
(BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a
decision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a
controlling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish
theoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA
consistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant
improvements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work
highlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and
large-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights
that can be built upon in future studies.

*Yinan Li,Kwang-Sung Jun*

TL;DR: 本文研究了 [0,1] 值回归问题，提出了一种新的损失函数 betting loss，实现了方差相关的界限，且不需要关于方差的任何先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在 i.i.d. 设置中考虑 [0,1] 值回归问题。研究是否存在一种损失函数，可以实现方差相关的界限（也称为二阶界限），这是对一阶界限的严格改进。

Method: 提出了一个新的损失函数 betting loss

Result: 证明了 log loss 最小化器导致类似的一阶界限。提出了一个新的损失函数，称为 betting loss，实现了方差相关的界限。

Conclusion: 提出了一个新的损失函数，称为 betting loss，实现了方差相关的界限，且不需要关于方差的任何先验知识。

Abstract: We consider the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. In a
related problem called cost-sensitive classification, \citet{foster21efficient}
have shown that the log loss minimizer achieves an improved generalization
bound compared to that of the squared loss minimizer in the sense that the
bound scales with the cost of the best classifier, which can be arbitrarily
small depending on the problem at hand. Such a result is often called a
first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log
loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there
exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as
a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds.
We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function
called the betting loss. Our result is ``variance-adaptive'' in the sense that
the bound is attained \textit{without any knowledge about the variance}, which
is in contrast to modeling label (or reward) variance or the label distribution
itself explicitly as part of the function class such as distributional
reinforcement learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为元学习有效地表示异构表格数据集仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。以前的方法依赖于旨在通用的表示。

Method: 提出了两种新的表格表示学习方法，专门用于特定的元任务——热启动贝叶斯超参数优化。第一种方法涉及深度度量学习，而第二种方法基于地标重建。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的编码器可以有效地学习与地标对齐的表示，但可能不会直接转化为 HPO 热启动元任务中的显着性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的编码器可以有效地学习与地标对齐的表示，但可能不会直接转化为 HPO 热启动元任务中的显着性能提升。

Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning
purposes is still an open problem. Previous approaches rely on representations
that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for
tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task -
warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. Both follow the specific
requirement formulated by ourselves that enforces representations to capture
the properties of landmarkers. The first approach involves deep metric
learning, while the second one is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We
evaluate the proposed encoders in two ways. Next to the gain in the target
meta-task, we also use the degree of fulfillment of the proposed requirement as
the evaluation metric. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders
can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not
directly translate to significant performance gains in the meta-task of HPO
warm-starting.

TL;DR: TASKPGM 是一种用于混合优化的框架，它选择连续任务比例，平衡任务之间的代表性和多样性，并在 LLM 微调中实现持续的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大型语言模型 (LLM) 的性能关键取决于训练混合物的组成。然而，选择最佳的任务数据集混合仍然是一个主要依靠手动、启发式驱动的过程，从业者通常依赖于统一或基于大小的抽样策略。

Method: 提出了一种原则性和可扩展的混合优化框架 TASKPGM，该框架通过最小化马尔可夫随机场 (MRF) 上的能量函数来选择连续任务比例。使用行为散度（例如 Jensen Shannon 散度和逐点互信息）对任务关系进行建模，这些散度是从单任务微调模型的预测分布中计算得出的。

Result: 该方法在单纯形约束下产生闭式解，并可证明地平衡了任务之间的代表性和多样性。我们提供理论保证，包括预算变体的弱子模性。

Conclusion: TASKPGM在各种评估套件（如MMLU和BIGBench）上，对Llama 2和Mistral模型进行了持续的实证改进。它还提供了对任务影响和混合组成的 interpretable insights，使其成为高效且稳健的 LLM 微调的强大工具。

Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically
on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend
of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with
practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We
introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization
that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over
a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral
divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information
computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our
method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably
balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical
guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate
consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation
suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers
interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a
powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

TL;DR: 本文深入描述了基于真实生产数据的法学硕士培训启动开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 启动开销在大型工业级法学硕士中尤为重要，在这些法学硕士中，故障发生得更频繁，并且多个团队以迭代更新-调试周期运行。在我们其中一个训练集群中，仅启动开销就浪费了超过 3.5% 的 GPU 时间。

Method: 为了缓解这些瓶颈，Bootseer 引入了三种技术：(a) 热块记录和预取，(b) 依赖项快照和 (c) 条带化 HDFS-FUSE。

Result: 我们分析了启动成本的组成部分，量化了其直接影响，并检查了它如何随作业规模扩展。这些见解推动了 Bootseer 的设计，Bootseer 是一个系统级优化框架，解决了三个主要的启动瓶颈：(a) 容器镜像加载，(b) 运行时依赖项安装和 (c) 模型检查点恢复。

Conclusion: Bootseer已在生产环境中部署，并在实际的LLM训练工作负载上进行了评估，证明启动开销减少了 50%。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving
breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs
involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is
important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup
overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training
efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly
critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs
begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,
industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams
operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more
than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training
startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of
startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job
size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level
optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)
container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model
checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three
techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and
(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment
and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in
startup overhead.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究推理模型中回溯行为的潜在机制，因为回溯是增强模型能力的关键机制。

Method: 通过控制向量操纵DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B模型中的回溯行为

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B的基础模型激活中识别出一个方向，该方向在用于引导推理模型时，会系统地诱导回溯。并且发现这种方向的影响不能用token级别的属性来解释。此外，该方向不会在基础模型中引起回溯，这意味着推理微调过程会重新利用预先存在的表示来形成新的行为回路。

Conclusion: 推理微调后的模型会重新利用预先存在的模型表示，而不是从头开始学习新的能力。

Abstract: Backtracking, an emergent behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning, has
been shown to be a key mechanism in reasoning models' enhanced capabilities.
Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors,
but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show
that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part
driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations.
Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream
which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled
reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction
cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that
this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that
the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to
form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction
is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings
offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose
pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities
from scratch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 侵入性和非侵入性神经接口有望成为下一代技术的高带宽输入设备。然而，神经信号固有地编码关于个人身份和健康状况的敏感信息，使得用于解码器训练的数据共享成为一个关键的隐私挑战。

Method: 引入基于联邦学习的神经解码，并使用高维肌电信号在开放和闭环场景中系统地评估其性能和隐私。

Result: 在开放环路模拟中，联邦学习明显优于本地学习基线，证明了其在高性能、隐私意识神经解码方面的潜力。相比之下，闭环用户研究需要调整联邦学习方法，以适应单用户、实时交互，而标准联邦学习不支持这种情况。这种修改导致本地学习解码器在闭环性能方面超过了调整后的联邦学习方法，但本地学习仍然带来更高的隐私风险。

Conclusion: 在实时自适应应用中，性能和隐私之间存在重要的权衡，并且需要专门为协同自适应单用户应用设计的联邦学习方法。

Abstract: Invasive and non-invasive neural interfaces hold promise as high-bandwidth
input devices for next-generation technologies. However, neural signals
inherently encode sensitive information about an individual's identity and
health, making data sharing for decoder training a critical privacy challenge.
Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework,
presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop
adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and
systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional
electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop
simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines,
demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural
decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to
accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by
standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing
the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still
carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical
performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate
the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user
applications.

TL;DR: This paper presents a transfer learning method and an adaptive activation function to improve the extrapolation ability of PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs often exhibit poor extrapolation performance and are highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions.

Method: The proposed method applies transfer learning within an extended training domain and uses an adaptive activation function that is a linear combination of standard activation functions.

Result: The method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain without a significant increase in computational cost.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a transfer learning method and an adaptive activation function to improve the extrapolation capability of PINNs.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that
incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process,
making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering
problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful
framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to
improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often
exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are
highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we
introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation
capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an
extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected
collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form
of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our
method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average
of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all
without a significant increase in computational cost. The code is available at

Motivation: The training dynamics of deep neural networks are theoretically unclear.

Method: The study develops a continuous-time, matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework.

Result: The study derives exact SDEs showing that squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion and characterizes stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with power-law tails, explaining the 'bulk+tail' spectral structure.

Conclusion: The study provides a rigorous foundation for understanding why deep learning works by connecting SGD dynamics to the evolution of singular-value spectra, validating theoretical predictions with experiments.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized machine learning, yet their training
dynamics remain theoretically unclear-we develop a continuous-time,
matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that rigorously
connects the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of
singular-value spectra in weight matrices. We derive exact SDEs showing that
squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion,
and characterize stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with
power-law tails, providing the first theoretical explanation for the
empirically observed 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks.
Through controlled experiments on transformer and MLP architectures, we
validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate quantitative agreement
between SDE-based forecasts and observed spectral evolution, providing a
rigorous foundation for understanding why deep learning works.

Conclusion: High-dimensional numerical results validate the theory and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing solution error.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework, the layer separation
(LySep) model, to improve the deep learning-based methods in solving partial
differential equations. Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss
function in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to
suboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing,
resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary
variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the
output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary
variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of
shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are
established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.
Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where
many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and
the original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory
and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing
solution error.

TL;DR: A multi-channel deep learning model predicts financial risk for SMEs listed on NEEQ, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NEEQ-listed SMEs face elevated financial distress risks due to limited scale and financial resilience.

Method: A Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) is used to process numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs, fused with attention and gating mechanisms.

Result: The model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods and single-modality baselines in AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-channel deep learning model outperforms traditional methods in predicting financial risk for NEEQ-listed SMEs.

Abstract: With the continuous evolution of China's multi-level capital market, the
National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third
Board," has become a critical financing platform for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial
resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial
distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning
framework that integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures,
and enterprise relationship data for comprehensive financial risk prediction.
Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that
processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These
modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism
followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy.
Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate
that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods
and single-modality baselines in terms of AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
This work provides theoretical and practical insights into risk modeling for
SMEs and offers a data-driven tool to support financial regulators and

TL;DR: FLDmamba, a novel framework leveraging Fourier and Laplace transforms, outperforms Transformer-based and Mamba-based architectures in time series prediction by effectively capturing multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics while improving robustness to data noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series prediction faces significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data, including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics, particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise issues in time series.

Method: This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations. FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise issue.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures.

Conclusion: FLDmamba achieves superior performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures.

### [159] [RONOM: Reduced-Order Neural Operator Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12814)
*Sven Dummer,Dongwei Ye,Christoph Brune*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RONOM 结合了 ROM 和神经算子，在偏微分方程求解中实现了可比甚至更优的性能，并提供了新的时间超分辨率见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时变偏微分方程在基于物理的建模中无处不在，但它们在实时预测、最优控制和不确定性量化等多次查询场景中仍然需要大量的计算。降阶建模 (ROM) 通过构建低维替代模型来应对这些挑战，但依赖于固定的离散化，这限制了评估期间不同网格的灵活性。算子学习方法（例如神经算子）通过参数化无限维函数空间之间的映射来提供替代方案，从而能够适应不同分辨率的数据。

Method: 引入了降阶神经算子建模 (RONOM) 框架，该框架桥接了 ROM 和算子学习中的概念

Result: 我们建立了类似于 ROM 中的离散化误差界限，并获得了对 RONOM 的离散化收敛性和离散化鲁棒性的见解。此外，还提供了两个数值示例，将 RONOM 与现有的神经算子进行比较，以求解偏微分方程。

Conclusion: RONOM 使用标准向量到向量神经网络在输入泛化方面取得了可比较的性能，在空间超分辨率和离散化鲁棒性方面均取得了优异的性能，同时还提供了对时间超分辨率场景的新颖见解。

Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based
modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios,
such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification.
Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a
low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which
limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning
approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to
data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical
error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization
convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the
infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the
reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges
concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error
bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization
convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are
presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial
differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard
vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input
generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and
discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal
super-resolution scenarios.

*Gaurav Chaudhary,Laxmidhar Behera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLOAD是一种新颖的离线奖励注释框架，用于离线RL，它使用随机网络蒸馏（RND）从专家演示中生成内在奖励，从而实现强大的离线策略学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习（RL）旨在从静态数据集中学习有效的策略，而无需进一步的agent-environment交互。然而，其在实践中的应用通常受到对显式奖励注释的需求的阻碍，这些注释的工程成本可能很高或者难以追溯获得。

Method: ReLOAD使用随机网络蒸馏（RND）从专家演示中生成内在奖励，使用简单但有效的嵌入差异度量。首先，我们训练一个预测器网络来模仿基于专家状态转换的固定目标网络的嵌入。后来，这些网络之间的预测误差用作静态数据集中每次转换的奖励信号。

Result: 通过区分类似专家的转换，RND预测误差可以有效地用作内在奖励。

Conclusion: ReLOAD实现了强大的离线策略学习，并且在D4RL基准测试中实现了与传统奖励注释方法具有竞争力的性能。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from a
static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions.
However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit
reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain
retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning
with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation
framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex
alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to
generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet
effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to
mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.
Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal
for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured
reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a
formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction
errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like
transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables
robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with
traditional reward-annotated methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然后续工作深入探讨了这种特征值行为的潜在机制，但仍然缺乏对 EoS 期间 NTK 特征向量行为的理解。

Method: 详细检查了 EoS 期间 NTK 特征向量的动态。

Result: 我们观察到，在不同的架构中，较大的学习率会导致最终 NTK 的主导特征向量以及完整的 NTK 矩阵与训练目标更好地对齐。然后，我们研究了这种现象的潜在机制，并为两层线性网络提供了理论分析。

Conclusion: 该研究增强了对深度学习中 GD 训练动态的理解。

Abstract: The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) in deep learning has drawn
increasing attention in recent years. NTKs typically actively change during
training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on
Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in
which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely
proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored
the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the
understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still
missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in
detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates
cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK
matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the
underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for
a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training
dynamics in deep learning.

*Zhijian Zhou,Liuhua Peng,Xunye Tian,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Norm-Adaptive MMD (NAMMD) to improve distribution closeness testing (DCT) for complex data. NAMMD scales MMD's value using RKHS norms, addressing MMD's limitations. The NAMMD-based DCT demonstrates higher test power than MMD-based DCT and NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than the MMD-based two-sample test.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DCT methods mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete one-dimensional spaces, which limits their applications to complex data. MMD's value can be the same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs

Method: design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions. Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the NAMMD-based DCT

Result: NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive experiments on many types of data. NAMMD for addressing the two-sample testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

Conclusion: NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive experiments. NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

Abstract: The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance
between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods
mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete
one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their
applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of
data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful
measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex
distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the
same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when
assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the
issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive
MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.
Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the
NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.
Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to
MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive
experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).
Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample
testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than
the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

Conclusion: CSI扰动具有区分潜力，可以一致地编码生物特征。使用低成本商用Wi-Fi硬件的无源、无设备人员识别是可行的。

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is gaining momentum as a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based systems for human identification. However, person
identification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion,
remains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on
movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In
contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals
from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains
stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced
by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To
support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a
controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across
multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier
removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our
dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities
separately and achieves 99.82\% classification accuracy, outperforming
convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines. These results demonstrate
the discriminative potential of CSI perturbations, highlighting their capacity
to encode biometric traits in a consistent manner. They further confirm the
viability of passive, device-free person identification using low-cost
commodity Wi-Fi hardware in real-world settings.

Motivation: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated data is the predominant paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models and for imitation learning of control policies. SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL objective in a sparse reward setting.

Method: introduce importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT).

Result: a small modification to SFT leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve performance compared to SFT on curated data.

Conclusion: importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT) is competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks, achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant
paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as
for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection
between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal
policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we
clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL
objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good
performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT
leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL
as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve
performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as
importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to
implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.
The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for
large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.
For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Abstract: This work explores the feasibility of biometric authentication using EEG

Traditional EEG-based biometric systems, while secure, often suffer from low

propose a novel and practical framework leveraging ear-EEG signals as a

extracts an original combination of temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG

Motivation: 双臂机器人操作对于解决具有挑战性的任务至关重要。尽管通用操作最近取得了进展，但数据稀缺和具体化异质性仍然是进一步扩大双臂设置的严重障碍。

Method: VIDAR，一个两阶段框架，利用大规模的、基于扩散的视频预训练和一个新颖的掩码逆动力学模型进行动作预测。

Conclusion: VIDAR在泛化到未见过的任务和背景方面表现出色，超越了最先进的方法，展示了视频基础模型在实现可扩展和可泛化的机器人操作方面的潜力。

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

TL;DR: 学习拒绝低质量解释（LtX）的框架，其中预测器配备了一个拒绝器，用于评估解释的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最终用户可能难以解释或相信它们，这可能会使信任评估和下游决策变得复杂。分类器应该可以选择拒绝处理那些无法正确解释其预测的输入。

Method: 引入ULER（以用户为中心的低质量解释拒绝器），它从人类评级和每个特征的相关性判断中学习一个简单的拒绝器，以反映人类对解释质量的判断。

Result: ULER优于最先进的技术和解释感知学习拒绝策略。

Conclusion: ULER在八个分类和回归基准测试和一个新人为注释的数据集上，在LtX方面优于最先进的技术和解释感知学习拒绝策略。

Abstract: Machine Learning predictors are increasingly being employed in high-stakes
applications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons
behind their predictions, but are not always "high quality''. That is,
end-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can
complicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that
classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions
cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject
low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector
that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key
challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to
design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we
introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a
simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to
mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER
outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject
strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a
new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future
research.

TL;DR: Fremer, a frequency-domain forecasting model, outperforms Transformer models in cloud workload forecasting with better accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. It also reduces latency and resource consumption in auto-scaling tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages.

Method: propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model in the frequency domain

Conclusion: Fremer consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of 5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally, in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%.

Abstract: Workload forecasting is pivotal in cloud service applications, such as
auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational
efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated
remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls
short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given
that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing
these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this
end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model.
Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior
efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it
achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period
series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source
workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing
workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on
both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer
consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of
5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while
simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally,
in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average
latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its
practical efficacy in real-world applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new explainability method driven by uncertainty quantification and disentanglement, which improves the robustness and attainability of explanations in ML and DL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need for transparency in model predictions, especially as interpretability diminishes when using increasingly complex architectures.

Method: This paper proposes leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical explainability methods and distinguishes between aleatoric (data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection of appropriate explanations.

Result: The result is a framework of explainability methods driven by uncertainty quantification and disentanglement.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the impact of the uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have emphasized the need for
transparency in model predictions, particularly as interpretability diminishes
when using increasingly complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical
explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric
(data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection
of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection
criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into
insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty
informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual
explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by
uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the
impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability
of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trace reconstruction problem arises in applications such as DNA data storage, a promising storage medium. Errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and sequencing require correction through trace reconstruction.

Method: TReconLM leverages language models trained on next-token prediction for trace reconstruction. Language models are pretrained on synthetic data and fine-tuned on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error patterns.

Result: TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

Conclusion: TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction algorithms, recovering a substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

Abstract: The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original
sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions,
insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA
data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density
and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and
sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace
reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work,
we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token
prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic
data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error
patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction
algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a
substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

Motivation: 标准策略梯度方法可能存在不稳定和样本效率低下的问题，特别是在稀疏奖励设置中。

Method: 引入了两种Differentiable Automatic Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) 算法的新修改方法，从混合策略的角度出发。

Result: 通过结合预训练的稳定引导策略和重新利用零奖励样本，提高了训练稳定性和收敛速度，并增强了样本效率。同时，为这两种方法提供了理论分析，证明了它们的目标函数在强化学习的既定理论框架内收敛到最优解。

Conclusion: 提出了一种混合策略框架，有效平衡了探索和利用，有望实现更稳定和高效的策略优化。

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic
Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy
perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and
sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this,
we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding
policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the
training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training
stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.
Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are
often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these
samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance
sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,
demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution
within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The
proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and
exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost limits the feasibility of MCMC algorithms for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and existing MCMC acceleration solutions lack hardware flexibility or system-level efficiency.

Method: MC$^2$A: an algorithm-hardware co-design framework with a parametrized hardware accelerator architecture, a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units, reconfigurable samplers, a crossbar interconnect, and a novel Gumbel sampler.

Result: MC$^2$A achieves an overall {$307.6$\times, $1.4$\times, $2.0$\times, $84.2$\times} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator.

Conclusion: MC$^2$A achieves significant speedups compared to CPU, GPU, TPU, and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerators, demonstrating the feasibility of general hardware acceleration for MCMC-based solutions.

Abstract: An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms
for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine
learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility
for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC
acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to
maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end
applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware
co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC
acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity
through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd
dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and
memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware
accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels
with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,
reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular
access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel
sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the
end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$,
$1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU
and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC
workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general
hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的概率框架ARES，用于检测大型语言模型推理链中传播的错误，并在四个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）生成的推理链中，初始错误通常会传播并破坏最终结论的可靠性。当前的基于 LLM 的错误检测方法通常无法检测到传播的错误，因为它们没有适当地考虑早期错误可能如何破坏对下游推理的判断。

Method: 引入了一种新颖的概率框架，即自回归推理蕴含稳定性（ARES），该框架通过仅根据先前评估的可靠前提来判断每个主张，从而防止错误传播。

Result: ARES在四个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并在检测传播的错误方面表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ARES在四个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能（72.1% Macro-F1，+8.2 分），并在非常长的合成推理链上表现出卓越的鲁棒性，在这些推理链中，它擅长检测传播的错误（90.3% F1，+27.6 分）。

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

Motivation: 可解释性可以提高 AI 模型的安全性、透明度和信任度，这在医疗保健应用中尤其重要，因为决策通常会带来重大后果。 机械可解释性，特别是通过使用稀疏自动编码器 (SAE)，为揭示大型基于 Transformer 的模型中的人类可解释特征提供了一种有前景的方法。

Method: 将 Matryoshka-SAE 应用于放射学专业的多模态大型语言模型 MAIRA-2，以解释其内部表示。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了实践和方法上的挑战，但为深入了解 MAIRA-2 学习到的内部概念提供了初步见解，标志着朝着更深入的机制理解和放射学改编的多模态大型语言模型的可解释性迈出了一步，并为提高模型透明度铺平了道路。

Abstract: Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models,
which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often
carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly
through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for
uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models.
In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal
large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using
large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range
of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and
tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the
influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating
directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal
practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into
the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper
mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted
multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model
transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations:

Result: 本文对算法进行了随机游走角度的理论分析，并展示了如何通过调整谱系数来调节冗余随机游走的贡献。基于 MRGNN 架构的探索性实验表明了该方法的潜力，并为未来的研究提出了有希望的方向。

Conclusion: 本文通过在 Multiresolution Reservoir Graph Neural Network (MRGNN) 中引入 Fairing 算法，提出了一种新的图神经网络变体。该算法提供了一种通带谱滤波器，允许在没有收缩的情况下进行平滑。

Abstract: Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a
preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying
layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence
of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This
work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir
Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a
variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of
surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band
spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted
to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral
formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks
where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph
classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical
analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it
shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the
contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the
MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest
promising directions for future research.

Conclusion: 该模型在估计铁路道 ballast 和轨枕刚度参数方面显著优于现有方法，具有准确、局部和全自动drive-by基础设施健康监测的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure
health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a decentralized GAN training approach using federated and split learning to address data and device heterogeneity while preserving privacy, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training generative models requires large datasets and computational resources, which are often unavailable. Acquiring such resources is costly and inefficient, and obtaining large datasets is challenging due to privacy concerns. Many underutilized devices with varying capabilities remain idle.

Method: The paper proposes a novel approach for decentralized GAN training, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning.

Result: The proposed approach achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation scores and an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in multi-domain non-IID settings), with lower latency compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across key performance metrics, achieving 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in multi-domain non-IID settings), and lower latency compared to several benchmarks.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable
multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing
their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,
training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant
computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.
Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many
underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying
capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due
to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling
to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data
and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw
form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized
environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address
the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous
U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under
strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether
real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows
that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across
key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation
scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in
multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several
benchmarks. Find our code at https://github.com/youssefga28/HuSCF-GAN.

Motivation: 公平性已成为联邦学习中的关键挑战之一。在横向联邦设置中，数据异构性通常会导致客户端之间出现显着的性能差异，从而引发对公平模型行为的担忧。

Method: 提出了一种公平感知联邦学习算法 FedGA。首先，采用 Gini 系数来衡量客户端之间的性能差异。在此基础上，建立了 Gini 系数 $G$ 与全局模型 ${U_s}$ 的更新规模之间的关系，并利用这种关系自适应地确定公平干预的时间。随后，根据系统的实时公平性状态动态调整聚合权重，使全局模型能够更好地整合来自性能相对较差的客户端的信息。

Conclusion: FedGA有效地提高了方差和 Gini 系数等公平性指标，同时保持了强大的整体性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Fairness has emerged as one of the key challenges in federated learning. In
horizontal federated settings, data heterogeneity often leads to substantial
performance disparities across clients, raising concerns about equitable model
behavior. To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated
learning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the
performance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship
between the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model
${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of
fairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation
weights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the
global model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively
poor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10,
CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets. The results show that FedGA effectively
improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient, while
maintaining strong overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs

### [181] [SMART: Relation-Aware Learning of Geometric Representations for Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13001)
*Kossi Amouzouvi,Bowen Song,Andrea Coletta,Luigi Bellomarini,Jens Lehmann,Sahar Vahdati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a framework that evaluates how well each relation fits with different geometric transformations, learning a single relation-specific EGT in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Demonstrated through evaluations on benchmark KGs and a real-world financial KG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent relations in a KG as geometric transformations. However, the current use of EGTs by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent all the relations.

Method: We propose a framework that evaluates how well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space.

Result: performance comparable to leading models

Conclusion: The effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a performance comparable to leading models

Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between
symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their
feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent
relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such
as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These
geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific
structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs
by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific
transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by
ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite
version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent
all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how
well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this
ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each
relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply
across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT
in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we
use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low
dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The
effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations
on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a
performance comparable to leading models

*Luis Basora,Louison Bocquet-Nouaille,Elinirina Robinson,Serge Le Gonidec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new fault detection and diagnosis framework for reusable space launchers' electrical systems is proposed, using autoencoders and classifiers. It shows promise but needs real-world testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing an onboard fault detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls engine valves in reusable space launchers, addressing a broader range of key requirements compared to existing approaches.

Method: A temporal convolutional autoencoder extracts low-dimensional features from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis use binary and multiclass classifiers on the autoencoder's latent and residual spaces. Inductive conformal anomaly detection identifies OOD data. CUSUM and threshold moving limit false alarms and address class imbalance.

Result: The framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated on simulated data, covering nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed solution shows promise but requires further testing with real data to reach operational maturity.

Abstract: In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable
space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault
detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the
engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is
designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating
confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases,
and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal
convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features
from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried
out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder
latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient
boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as
confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal
anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet
effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the
false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault
detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated
on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.
The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though
testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the
required maturity level for operational use.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps, and assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring protected natural areas at scale using satellite imagery and machine learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness assessment.

Method: a data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation

Result: CFR assigned higher relevance to shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research. As uncertainty increases, the interpretability of relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows.

Conclusion: CFR provides a data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

Abstract: Protected natural areas play a vital role in ecological balance and ecosystem
services. Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine
learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and
uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness
assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a
data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep
Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty
influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the
dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic
analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite
imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to
shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness
assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the
interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows,
indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a
data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in
satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于 Transformer 的模型最近在长期时间序列预测 (LTSF) 中占据主导地位，但它们的架构变化（例如，仅编码器、编码器-解码器和仅解码器设计）提出了一个关键问题：哪种 Transformer 架构最适合 LTSF 任务？然而，现有模型通常与各种特定于时间序列的设计紧密结合，因此难以分离架构本身的影响。

Method: 我们提出了一个新的分类法，解开了这些设计，从而能够更清晰、更统一地比较 Transformer 架构。我们的分类法考虑了关键方面，例如注意力机制、预测聚合、预测范式和归一化层。

Result: 双向注意力和联合注意力最有效；更完整的预测聚合提高了性能；直接映射范式优于自回归方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用最佳架构选择，我们的组合模型始终优于现有模型，从而加强了我们结论的有效性。我们希望这些发现能为未来在 LTSF 中 Transformer 架构设计的研究提供有价值的指导。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time
Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial
question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However,
existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific
designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.
To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs,
enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our
taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting
aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through
extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional
attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting
aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms
autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal
architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models,
reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer
valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in
LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.

Motivation: Learning a graph's labeling, knowing its structure and label set.

Method: Studying PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies of a countably infinite graph G, where each copy is induced by permuting G's vertices.

Result: Characterizing graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random graph.

Conclusion: PAC learnability of all finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. Learnability for k-vertex permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

Abstract: We study PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies
of a countably infinite graph G, where each copy is induced by permuting G's
vertices. This corresponds to learning a graph's labeling, knowing its
structure and label set. We consider classes where permutations move only
finitely many vertices. Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such
finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type
of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also
characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not
learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random
graph. Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex
permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a
four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine
using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

Conclusion: DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational
resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce
Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which
bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.
Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional
Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model

AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable
explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: Electroencephalography (EEG) is highly susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance.

Method: A novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework is proposed, which aligns feature semantics through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.

Result: The proposed approach improves EEG-based emotion regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-modal knowledge distillation framework improves EEG-based emotion regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset, highlighting its potential for BCI applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state
monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly
susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which
lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG
learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer
knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.
Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label
misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual
feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create
discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper
addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined
labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that
mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics
through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific
distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion
regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and
multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight
the potential of our framework for BCI applications.

Conclusion: Spectral Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The effect of representation has been demonstrated in reinforcement learning,
from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing
representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning
with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a
novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which
aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of
possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key
insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the
zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by
the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance
structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded
objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this
Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to
existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable
structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,
and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration
and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to
powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral
Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning
more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based

Motivation: 单调梯度函数在求解最优传输问题的 Monge 公式中起着核心作用，该公式出现在从流体动力学到机器人集群控制等现代应用中。当传输成本是平方欧几里德距离时，Brenier 定理保证了唯一的最优映射是凸函数的梯度，即单调梯度映射，并且它满足 Monge-Ampère 方程。

Result: 实验表明，mGradNets 的结构偏差有助于学习最优传输图。

Conclusion: 利用 mGradNets 直接学习最优传输映射，并将其应用于机器人集群控制问题。

Abstract: Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge
formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern
applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the
transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees
that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a
monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In
[arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks
(mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone
gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the
optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using
the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of
mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our
method for a robot swarm control problem.

Motivation: 时间序列基础模型越来越受欢迎，但对领域外缺失值插补这一关键任务的探索仍然不足。

Method: MoTM结合了独立训练的INRs基础，每个INRs都在不同的时间序列族上进行训练，并结合了一个岭回归器，该回归器在推理时适应观察到的上下文。

Conclusion: MoTM在各种插补场景中展示了强大的域内和域外泛化能力，为适应性强的基础插补模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation
models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task
of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We
propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and
naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they
have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle
under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of
Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.
Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen
patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a
distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the
observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and
out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block
and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for
adaptable foundation imputation models.

TL;DR: 利用其他市场的数据，比利时和瑞典的电价预测精度分别提高了 22% 和 9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的短期电价预测对于在日前市场中战略性地安排需求和发电投标至关重要。虽然近年来数据驱动技术在实现高预测精度方面显示出了相当的实力，但它们严重依赖于输入协变量的质量。

Method: 使用一个最先进的模型集合。

Result: 当包括来自具有较早 GCT 的互连市场（德国-卢森堡、奥地利和瑞士）的价格数据时，比利时 (BE) 和瑞典投标区 (SE3) 的预测精度分别显着提高了 22% 和 9%。这种改进适用于一般和极端市场条件。

Conclusion: 在日益互联互通和动荡的欧洲能源市场中，这些发现为旨在优化投标策略的市场参与者和决策者提供了宝贵的指导。

Abstract: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for
strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While
data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high
forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input
covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published
prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones
can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a
state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%
and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)
respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with
earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement
holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also
yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary
for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,
and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a
fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast
models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market
participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within
increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.

*Zikai Xie,Linjiang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的贝叶斯优化 (BO) 核方法，用于置换空间，称为 Merge Kernel，它比现有技术水平的 Mallows Kernel 更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的置换空间贝叶斯优化 (BO) 方法依赖于 Mallows 核，这是一种 $\Omega(n^2)$ 表示，它显式地枚举每个成对比较。

Method: 提出了一种基于排序算法在置换空间上生成核函数的新框架，并引入了由合并排序构造的 Merge Kernel。

Result: Merge Kernel用 $\Theta(n\log n)$ 取代了二次复杂度，实现了尽可能最低的复杂度。由此产生的特征向量明显更短，可以在线性对数时间内计算，但仍然有效地捕获有意义的排列距离。提出的内核在各种排列优化基准测试中始终优于最先进的 Mallows Kernel。

Conclusion: Merge Kernel在各种排列优化基准测试中始终优于最先进的 Mallows Kernel。结果表明，Merge Kernel 为排列空间中的贝叶斯优化提供了一种更紧凑但更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box
optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation
spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that
explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close
relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a
novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on
sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as
a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the
\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic
complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.
The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in
linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation
distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing
compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic
descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element
displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,
which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the
two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which
summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation
optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more
compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation
space.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRENN and MT-TRENN, novel architectures for team modeling that capture relational and temporal dynamics. MT-TRENN can simultaneously predict multiple team constructs and provide interpretable insights. The approach outperforms existing methods and is suitable for Human-Centered AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not meet these practical demands

Method: a novel tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task head

Result: approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights and actionable suggestions to support team improvement

Conclusion: The approach is well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative environments.

Abstract: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of
Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research
emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical
applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team
constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable
recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not
meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel
tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph
extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct
prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly
captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation
for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task
head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously
predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership
Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal
or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that
the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights
and actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make
our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such
as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative
environments.

TL;DR: This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial information, to estimate socio-economic indicators even for data-scarce regions such as developing countries. The model leverages the prior knowledge of large language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable effective estimation in few-shot settings.

Motivation: Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable development. to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as developing countries.

Method: a regression model that integrates diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial information, to estimate these indicators

Result: Our model obtains contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator, categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.

### [199] [Training Transformers with Enforced Lipschitz Constants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13338)
*Laker Newhouse,R. Preston Hess,Franz Cesista,Andrii Zahorodnii,Jeremy Bernstein,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to train Lipschitz-constrained transformers, achieving some success in smaller models but requiring extremely high Lipschitz bounds to match the performance of standard models like NanoGPT. The trained Lipschitz transformers don't require stability measures such as layer norm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations. This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization.

Method: develop and benchmark novel, computationally-efficient tools for maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training. Inspired by Muon's update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter transformers.

Result: Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound increases to 10^264.

Conclusion: Lipschitz transformers train without stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's
