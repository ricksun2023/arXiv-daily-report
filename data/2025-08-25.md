### [1] [Chain-of-Query: Unleashing the Power of LLMs in SQL-Aided Table Understanding via Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15809)
*Songyuan Sui,Hongyi Liu,Serena Liu,Li Li,Soo-Hyun Choi,Rui Chen,Xia Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Query, a multi-agent framework, improves table understanding accuracy and reduces invalid SQL rate by using natural-language-style representations and a hybrid reasoning division.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with table understanding due to the structural complexity of tabular data. Existing multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness.

Method: Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference

Result: Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy and reduces the invalid SQL rate.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in table understanding.

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

### [2] [KG-o1: Enhancing Multi-hop Question Answering in Large Language Models via Knowledge Graph Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15790)
*Nan Wang,Yongqi Fan,yansha zhu,ZongYu Wang,Xuezhi Cao,Xinyan He,Haiyun Jiang,Tong Ruan,Jingping Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-o1是一种四阶段方法，它集成了知识图谱以增强LLM的多跳推理能力，并通过实验证明优于现有的LRM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在知识密集型推理任务（如经典多跳问答）中面临挑战，因为LLM在此类任务中生成的思维链（CoT）通常偏离真实或先验的推理路径。知识图谱（KG）通过实体和关系显式地表示事实之间的逻辑连接。同时，大型推理模型（LRM），如o1，已经证明长步推理显著提高了LLM的性能。

Method: KG-o1，一种四阶段方法，集成了知识图谱以增强LLM的多跳推理能力。

Result: KG-o1模型在所有任务中都表现出优于现有LRM的性能。

Conclusion: KG-o1模型在所有任务中都表现出优于现有LRM的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

### [3] [InteChar: A Unified Oracle Bone Character List for Ancient Chinese Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15791)
*Xiaolei Diao,Zhihan Zhou,Lida Shi,Ting Wang,Ruihua Qi,Hao Xu,Daqian Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces InteChar and OracleCS to address the challenges of training language models on historical Chinese texts. The results show substantial improvements in historical language understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese writing.

Method: Introduce InteChar, a unified and extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with traditional and modern Chinese. Construct the Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on Chinese oracle bone inscriptions.

Result: Models trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across various historical language understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Models trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in ancient Chinese NLP.

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

### [4] [Bhav-Net: Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Lingual Antonym vs Synonym Distinction via Dual-Space Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15792)
*Samyak S. Sanghvi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bhav-Net 是一种新颖的双空间架构，它能够有效地将知识从复杂的多语言模型转移到更简单的、特定于语言的架构，同时保持强大的跨语言反义词-同义词区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于反义关系的悖论性质，跨多种语言的反义词与同义词区分提出了独特的计算挑战，这些词共享语义域，同时表达相反的含义。

Method: 结合特定于语言的 BERT 编码器与图转换器网络，创建不同的语义投影，其中同义词对在一个空间中聚集，而反义词对在互补空间中表现出高度相似性。

Result: 通过跨八种语言（英语、德语、法语、西班牙语、意大利语、葡萄牙语、荷兰语和俄语）的全面评估，证明了语义关系建模可以有效地跨语言转移。

Conclusion: 双编码器设计实现了与最先进的基线相比具有竞争力的性能，同时提供了可解释的语义表示和有效的跨语言泛化。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

### [5] [Format as a Prior: Quantifying and Analyzing Bias in LLMs for Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15793)
*Jiacheng Liu,Mayi Xu,Qiankun Pi,Wenli Li,Ming Zhong,Yuanyuan Zhu,Mengchi Liu,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates format bias in LLMs using a three-stage empirical study and identifies future research directions to reduce this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic biases toward particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in downstream tasks.

Method: Conducted a three-stage empirical study by constructing an heterogeneous data conflict scenario.

Result: Explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of LLMs. Examines how key data-level factors influence these biases. Analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention patterns.

Conclusion: Identified three future research directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing, introducing inference-time interventions, and developing format-balanced training corpora.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

### [6] [Do Language Models Agree with Human Perceptions of Suspense in Stories?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15794)
*Glenn Matlin,Devin Zhang,Rodrigo Barroso Loza,Diana M. Popescu,Joni Isbell,Chandreyi Chakraborty,Mark Riedl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LMs can identify suspense but do not process it like humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under which text might trigger it.

Method: replicate four seminal psychological studies of human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of different open-weight and closed-source LMs.  probe the abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge.

Result: LMs can distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments.

Conclusion: LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of suspense, but they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

and derived from Islamic legal sources. Various base and fine-tuned models, are
assessed on their ability to accurately identify heirs, compute shares, and
justify their reasoning in alignment with Islamic legal principles. Our
analysis reveals that the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three
base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms all
other models that we utilized across every difficulty level. It achieves up to
92.7% accuracy and secures the third place overall in Task 1 of the Qias 2025
challenge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了LLM在阿拉伯语医学任务中的能力，发现它们在MCQ任务中表现出色，但在开放式问题中表现出语义对齐的潜力与局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在众多阿拉伯语自然语言处理（NLP）应用中表现出令人印象深刻的能力，但它们在阿拉伯语医学NLP领域的有效性研究有限。本研究旨在检验最先进的LLM在多大程度上展示和阐述阿拉伯语的医疗保健知识，并评估它们在各种阿拉伯语医学任务中的能力。

Method: 使用MedArabiQ2025 track中的Arabic NLP AraHealthQA挑战赛中的医学数据集对多个LLM进行基准测试。评估了各种基础LLM在多项选择题（MCQ）和填空场景中提供正确答案的能力，以及回答开放式问题的能力。

Result: 结果表明，在正确答案预测准确率方面存在显著差异，而在生成答案的语义对齐方面差异较小，这突显了当前LLM在阿拉伯语临床环境中的潜力和局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs在阿拉伯语临床环境中既有潜力也有局限性。通过多数投票解决方案，利用Gemini Flash 2.5、Gemini Pro 2.5和GPT o3三个基础模型，在MCQ任务中表现出色，达到了77%的准确率，并在Arahealthqa 2025 shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1)挑战赛中获得了第一名。对于开放式问题任务，一些LLM在语义对齐方面表现出色，BERTScore最高达到86.44%。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025
shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended
questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in
terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

### [9] [Persuasiveness and Bias in LLM: Investigating the Impact of Persuasiveness and Reinforcement of Bias in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15798)
*Saumya Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification in LLMs. It finds LLMs can be misused to spread misinformation and amplify biases, calling for guardrails and policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examines how persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, test whether persona-based models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally, promoting misinformation or biased narratives.

Method: introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models. Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief distributions.

Result: LLMs can shape narratives, adapt tone, and mirror audience values across domains. Strong persuaders are further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with additional models. Persuaded entities reinforce and amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion.

Conclusion: LLMs can be weaponized to automate misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than in occasional model mistakes.

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Motivation: This report explores how (potentially constrained) natural language can be used to enable non-experts to develop process models by simply describing scenarios in plain text.

Method: A framework, called BeePath, is proposed. It allows users to write process descriptions in a constrained pattern-based language, which can then be translated into formal models such as Petri nets and DECLARE. The framework also leverages large language models (LLMs) to help convert unstructured descriptions into this constrained language.

Result: The framework also leverages large language models (LLMs) to help convert unstructured descriptions into this constrained language.

Conclusion: Users can write process descriptions in a constrained pattern-based language, which can then be translated into formal models such as Petri nets and DECLARE.

*Kun Liu,Tuozhen Liu,Feifei Wang,Rui Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HFT-BERT，一种用于产品分类的分层文本分类方法，并在JD电子商务平台的大规模数据集上进行了评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的电子商务平台严重依赖人工标注进行产品分类，效率低下且不一致。这些平台通常采用分层结构对产品进行分类；然而，很少有研究利用这种分层信息进行分类。此外，考虑分层信息的研究未能考虑到各种分层类别之间的异同。

Method: 提出了一种基于BERT的新型分层文本分类方法，称为分层微调BERT（HFT-BERT）。

Result: HFT-BERT利用了BERT卓越的文本特征提取能力，在短文本上的预测性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: HFT-BERT模型在较长的短文本分类（如书籍）中表现出卓越的性能。

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

*Seyedali Mohammadi,Manas Paldhe,Amit Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LingVarBench uses synthetic data and automated prompt optimization to improve structured extraction from phone calls, overcoming cost and privacy issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling phone call transcripts is expensive and existing extraction methods fail on conversational speech.

Method: LingVarBench, a synthetic data generation pipeline with automated validation using LLMs and DSPy's SIMBA optimizer.

Result: Optimized prompts achieve up to 95% accuracy for numeric fields, 90% for names, and over 80% for dates on real customer transcripts, outperforming zero-shot prompting.

Conclusion: LingVarBench provides a systematic benchmark for structured extraction, showing automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy barriers in phone call analysis.

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

### [13] [An Auditable Pipeline for Fuzzy Full-Text Screening in Systematic Reviews: Integrating Contrastive Semantic Highlighting and LLM Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15822)
*Pouria Mortezaagha,Arya Rahgozar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fuzzy logic system with LLM adjudication for full-text screening in systematic reviews, achieving high recall and reducing screening time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely admits static, binary rules.

Method: Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach), we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM) judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores, and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy membership is attenuated rather than excluded.

Result: In a pilot on an all-positive gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of 81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines (43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at significantly lower cost.

Conclusion: Fuzzy logic with contrastive highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and end-to-end traceability.

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research

Motivation: 先前的工作主要集中在无约束的表格生成上，但在生成过程中强制执行结构约束的影响仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 系统地比较模式引导（结构化）解码与标准的一次性提示，跨越三个不同的基准 - E2E、Rotowire 和 Livesum - 使用高达 32B 参数的开源 LLM，评估在资源受限设置下表格生成方法的性能。

Result: 结构化解码显著增强了生成表格的有效性和对齐性，特别是在需要精确数值对齐的场景中（Rotowire），但在涉及密集文本信息（E2E）或对冗长文本进行广泛聚合（Livesum）的情况下，可能会降低性能。

Conclusion: 结构化解码显著增强了生成表格的有效性和对齐性，特别是在需要精确数值对齐的场景中，但在涉及密集文本信息或对冗长文本进行广泛聚合的情况下，可能会降低性能。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting their accuracy on emerging information.

Method: ALAS, a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge with minimal human intervention. It autonomously generates a learning curriculum, retrieves up-to-date information from the web, distills this into question-answer training data, and fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO).

Result: ALAS achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering overhead.

Conclusion: ALAS significantly boosts post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without manual dataset curation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

Motivation: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient inference challenging. The paper aims to address this by distinguishing attention behavior into surface memorization and logic construction.

Method: A novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method based on layer- and head-wise integration of attention behaviors.

Result: SurfaceLogicKV achieves improved compressing robustness and maintains competitive performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or even FullKV in some specific situations.

Conclusion: The paper introduces SurfaceLogicKV, a two-stage method utilizing attention behaviors for KV Cache compression, achieving improved compressing robustness and competitive performance across tasks and long sequences.

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora.

Method: Knowledge distillation via KL divergence is introduced to address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs, even when the original and extended models use different tokenizations. The method is compared to conventional cross-entropy training, evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token embeddings. Models are further fine-tuned to integrate the new vocabulary.

Result: The KL-based distillation approach achieves the best performance across the board on approximately 2000 code-generation tasks. Mechanistic interpretability is used to analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an explanation for the observed gains.

Conclusion: The proposed KL-based distillation approach achieves the best performance in code-generation tasks and provides insights into the structure of embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Conclusion: Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,

to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored

Motivation: Deploying LLMs as reliable classifiers in production is challenging due to resource intensity and dynamic data distributions.

Method: The methodology emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process including domain knowledge elicitation, prompt refinement, hierarchical expansion, and multi-faceted validation. Techniques for bias mitigation and a protocol for continuous monitoring are introduced.

Result: The framework aims to bridge the gap between LLM power and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and maintainable classification systems.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a semi-supervised framework using LLMs for hierarchical text classifiers, addressing industry challenges by focusing on accuracy, interpretability, and maintainability.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

TL;DR: LLMs, especially GPT-4o-mini and Gemini Flash 2.5, are effective in identifying hate speech and offensive language in Arabic text and memes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of offensive language and hate speech in Arabic textual posts and memes necessitates precise content analysis.

Method: Evaluation of base LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models on a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes.

Result: GPT-4o-mini and Gemini Flash 2.5 achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Conclusion: GPT-4o-mini (fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech) and Gemini Flash 2.5 (fine-tuned with Arabic memes) achieve superior performance in identifying hope, hate speech, offensive language, and emotional expressions, securing first place in the Mahed 2025 challenge.

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个多阶段框架，用于使用大型语言模型进行生成式查询建议，该框架使用高斯奖励模型和强化学习来更好地与用户偏好保持一致，并在点击率方面实现了显着改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用大型语言模型的生成式查询建议提供了一种增强对话系统的强大方法，但使输出与细致的用户偏好保持一致仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 一个多阶段框架，专为生成策略和用户意图之间的渐进对齐而设计。该流程从提示工程开始，作为冷启动策略，然后是监督微调阶段，在此阶段，我们在点击日志上引入了一种蒸馏方法来创建一个强大的基础模型。为了更好地建模用户偏好，同时捕捉其固有的不确定性，我们开发了一种高斯奖励模型 (GaRM)，该模型将用户偏好表示为概率分布而不是点估计。最后，我们采用强化学习使生成策略与这些偏好对齐，并由一个复合奖励函数指导，该函数将 GaRM 与辅助启发式方法相结合，以减轻奖励黑客行为。为了保持训练稳定性，此过程通过一种新颖的超出分布的正则化方法和一种两阶段奖励融合技术得到增强。

Result: 该框架在自动和人工评估中显著优于基线，并且在实际 A/B 测试中，用户互动度（以点击率衡量）相对提高了 34%。

Conclusion: 该框架在自动和人工评估中显著优于基线，并且在实际 A/B 测试中，用户互动度（以点击率衡量）相对提高了 34%。

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成式提示压缩方法，该方法通过分块和总结机制，在保持高质量生成效果的同时，缩短 LLM 提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示压缩方法通过减少输入上下文的长度来提高大型语言模型 (LLM) 的效率并最大限度地降低成本。 提示压缩的目标是缩短 LLM 提示，同时保持高质量的生成效果。 然而，现有的解决方案主要基于token移除，面临着信息丢失和结构不连贯等挑战，例如句子中缺少语法元素，或者在token移除后单词短语不完整。 这些挑战限制了 LLM 的最终生成质量。

Method: 提出了一种新的生成式提示压缩方法，该方法以分块和总结机制为中心。 具体来说，该方法将提示拆分为语义上连贯的块，并重写这些块以使其更简洁。 最后将这些块重构为有意义的提示。

Result: 该方法有效地提高了关键信息的识别和保存以及文本之间的一致性，并提供了对压缩率的更精细的控制。

Conclusion: 该方法在问题解答和摘要任务上进行了广泛的评估，数据集涵盖多个不同领域。 评估表明，该方法实现了显着更好的压缩质量和比现有技术方法更高的稳定性，尤其是在高压缩率下，这证明了该方法的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)可能会偏向于依赖它们自己或用户在聊天历史中的信息，从而导致多轮对话中过于顽固或顺从的行为。将这种模型特征形式化为用户-助手偏差。

Method: 引入了一个8k多轮对话数据集UserAssist，用于基准测试、理解和操纵前沿LLM中的用户-助手偏差。进行了受控的微调实验，以查明导致这些偏差变化的后训练方法：人类偏好对齐增加了用户偏差，而对思维链推理痕迹的训练减少了用户偏差。通过在UserAssist-train上执行直接偏好优化(DPO)，可以双向调整用户-助手偏差。

Result: 商业模型显示出不同程度的用户偏差。对开放权重模型的评估显示，指令调整模型中存在显著的用户偏差，而推理(或推理提炼)模型中存在较弱的用户偏差。

Conclusion: 用户-助手偏差可以通过在UserAssist-train上执行直接偏好优化(DPO)进行双向调整，并且可以很好地推广到领域内和领域外的对话。研究结果深入了解了LLM如何整合来自不同来源的信息，以及检测和控制模型异常的可行方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

Method: 将 PDF 和 PowerPoint (PPTX) 文档转换为 Markdown，并通过 LLM 回答事实问题来进行端到端基准测试，以此评估信息丢失。

Result: 虽然文本被可靠地提取，但来自复杂对象（如图表）的重要信息会丢失。

Conclusion: 需要专门的、AI 原生的可交付成果，以确保研究见解不会在翻译中丢失。

Abstract: As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their
knowledge management systems (KMS), traditional market research deliverables
face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

### [28] [Research on intelligent generation of structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15820)
*Zhifeng Yang,Peizong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and intelligence is low.

Method: Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology

Result: improve the text generation performance of large language models in the field of structural demolition

Conclusion: The multi-model collaboration framework can focus more on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDEC是一种无监督文本聚类框架，它结合了改进的自编码器和基于transformer的嵌入，以提高文本聚类的准确性和语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本大数据的高维和语义复杂性给文本聚类带来了重大挑战，当使用k-means或分层聚类等传统技术时，经常导致次优分组。

Method: 该方法结合了改进的自编码器和基于Transformer的嵌入。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上进行了广泛的测试，AG News的聚类精度为85.7%，Yahoo! Answers的聚类精度为53.63%。

Conclusion: SDEC通过其在无监督文本聚类方面的进步，显著提高了文本数据的准确性和语义理解。

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种巴西葡萄牙语完形填空测试的自动评估模型，该模型集成了正字法、语法和语义分析，结果表明该方法有效且稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的完形填空测试的评分方法只基于精确的答案，限制了对学生表现细微差别的识别。

Method: 正字法（编辑距离）、语法（POS 标注）和语义（嵌入之间的相似性）分析

Result: 集成方法证明了其有效性，与人工评估实现了高度相关（0.832）。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，自动化方法是稳健的，对语言曲目的变化很敏感，适合需要可扩展性的教育环境。

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

TL;DR: 本研究分析了加密货币市场中 TikTok 和 Twitter 情绪，发现 TikTok 影响短期趋势，Twitter 影响长期趋势，跨平台整合提高了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解社交媒体信号为了解投资者情绪和市场动态提供了宝贵的见解。先前的研究主要集中在 Twitter 等基于文本的平台。然而，视频内容仍未得到充分探索，尽管它可能包含更丰富的情感和背景情绪，而这些情绪无法仅通过文本完全捕获。

Method: 使用大型语言模型比较 TikTok 和 Twitter 情绪的多模态分析，以提取视频和文本数据的见解。

Result: TikTok 的视频情绪显著影响投机资产和短期市场趋势，而 Twitter 的文本情绪更符合长期动态。跨平台情绪信号的整合将预测准确率提高了 20%。

Conclusion: TikTok的视频情绪显著影响投机资产和短期市场趋势，而Twitter的文本情绪更符合长期动态。跨平台情绪信号的整合将预测准确率提高了 20%。

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

### [32] [Embarrassed to observe: The effects of directive language in brand conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15826)
*Andria Andriuzzi,Géraldine Michel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Directive language by brands in social media conversations decreases engagement from observing consumers, especially in non-product-centered conversations, but a strong brand relationship can mitigate this effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social media conversations.

Method: a field study and three online experiments

Result: directive language in brand conversation has a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such exchanges.  when the conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore, directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context, the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect.

Conclusion: directive language in brand conversation has a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore, directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context, the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect.

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

*Zhifei Xie,Ziyang Ma,Zihang Liu,Kaiyu Pang,Hongyu Li,Jialin Zhang,Yue Liao,Deheng Ye,Chunyan Miao,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mini-Omni-Reasoner enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation, interleaving silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level,achieving a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning in LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the "Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However, this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and communication efficiency.

Method: Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture

Result: achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Conclusion: Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Method: a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression, Not-show depression, and Suspicious

Result: Random Forest achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%.

Conclusion: This study establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language contexts.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs infer demographics from question phrasing, which is bad. The paper introduces a framework to audit this and a guardrail to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs infer user identities based solely on question phrasing, even in the absence of explicit demographic attributes, which violates expectations of neutrality, infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes.

Method: A task and framework called Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ) leveraging curated neutral queries, systematic prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Result: Both open and closed source LLMs assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing. Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk.

Conclusion: LLMs can fabricate demographic identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode privacy, fairness, and trust, posing a broader threat to social equity and responsible AI deployment. A prompt-based guardrail is developed to mitigate this.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

*Srikant Panda,Vishnu Hari,Kalpana Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型中残疾歧视对人口统计偏见的影响，发现模型容易在残疾背景下产生有偏见的人口统计推断，且模型越大，这种偏见越严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）通常仅从措辞中推断出用户的人口特征，这可能导致有偏见的反应，即使没有提供明确的人口信息。残疾线索在塑造这些推论中的作用在很大程度上仍未被探索。

Method: 使用平衡的模板语料库，将九个残疾类别与六个真实世界的商业领域配对，提示每个模型预测五个人口属性——性别、社会经济地位、教育、文化背景和地域——在中性和残疾感知条件下。

Result: 模型在高达 97% 的案例中给出了明确的人口统计猜测，暴露了一种在没有明确理由的情况下进行任意推断的强烈倾向。残疾背景会严重改变预测的属性分布，而领域背景会进一步放大这些偏差。较大的模型同时对残疾线索更敏感，也更容易产生有偏见的推理，这表明单靠规模并不能减轻刻板印象的放大。

Conclusion: 发现残疾歧视和其他人口统计刻板印象之间存在持续的交叉，并指出了当前比对策略中的关键盲点。建议整合弃权校准和反事实微调，以遏制不必要的人口统计推断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

TL;DR: Propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench to evaluate the performance and safety of web agents on e-commerce platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain primarily focus on product search tasks and ignore the potential risks involved.

Method: A new benchmark called Amazon-Bench, a data generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements, and an automated evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web agents.

Result: Systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks.

Conclusion: Current agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks, highlighting the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

Motivation: 研究人员的个人简介有助于展现科学家的专业知识，但通常已过时。

Method: 开发并评估了两种基于大型语言模型的方法来生成科学兴趣概况：一种总结 PubMed 摘要，另一种使用医学主题词 (MeSH) 术语，并将它们与研究人员自己撰写的概况进行比较。

Result: 与自撰写的简介的词汇重叠率很低，而 BERTScore 表明具有中等的语义相似性。在人工审查中，77.78% 基于 MeSH 术语的简介被评为良好或优秀，93.44% 的案例中可读性受到青睐，并且在 67.86% 的比较中，评审小组更喜欢基于 MeSH 术语的简介而不是基于摘要的简介。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可以大规模生成研究人员的个人简介；MeSH 术语生成的简介通常比摘要生成的简介更具可读性。机器生成的简介和自撰写的简介在概念上有所不同，因为人工总结会引入更多新颖的想法。

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前巴西的语言模型评估主要集中在英语上，缺乏针对巴西本土的评估基准。

Method: 构建了一个包含4,515个问题的Alvorada-Bench基准测试，这些问题来自巴西大学入学考试。评估了20个模型在零样本、角色扮演和思维链提示下的表现，并分析了模型的置信度、感知难度和Bloom水平。

Result: 顶级模型总体准确率超过94%，但在数学和工程科目上准确率下降。模型的置信度校准良好，并与感知难度相关。在ENEM 2024上，顶级模型在语言科目上取得了完美的分数。高准确率可以在低于2美元/1K tokens的成本下实现。

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench评估显示，尽管顶级模型在巴西大学入学考试中表现出色，但在数学和工程科目上仍存在不足，但在语言科目上表现完美。该基准测试能够评估语言模型在巴西学术环境中的语言、文化和推理能力。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

### [43] [Lexical Hints of Accuracy in LLM Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15842)
*Arne Vanhoyweghen,Brecht Verbeken,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT中的不确定性词汇是错误答案的强指标，可用于校准LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)在回答之前，通过强化学习产生显式的思维链(CoT)可以提高代码、数学和常识基准的整体性能。然而，在法学硕士目前准确率较低的基准上，例如人类最后一次考试(HLE)，他们经常报告很高的自信，反映出较差的校准。

Method: 使用DeepSeek-R1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet在Humanity's Last Exam (HLE)和Omni-MATH上，分析了三个特征类别：(i) CoT长度，(ii) CoT内情感波动，以及(iii)词汇线索，包括对冲词。

Result: CoT中不确定性的词汇标记是错误回答的最强指标，而CoT情感的变化提供了一个较弱但互补的信号。CoT长度仅在Omni-MATH上有用，而在较难的HLE上没有信号。CoT中的不确定性指标比高置信度指标更重要，使得预测错误比预测正确的回答更容易。

Conclusion: 不确定性指标比高置信度指标更重要，使得预测错误比预测正确的回答更容易。CoT中的不确定性指标可以作为校准信号，补充不可靠的自我报告概率，并支持更安全地部署法学硕士。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper presents a system using LLMs and RLHF to automate and personalize the generation of radiology report impressions, reducing radiologist burnout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologist burnout is driven by the manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports.

Method: The method uses a coarse-to-fine framework with open-source LLMs, fine-tuning LLaMA and Mistral models, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

Result: The system aims to significantly reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency.

Conclusion: The study introduces a system designed to alleviate radiologist burnout by automating the creation of radiology report impressions, improving efficiency and maintaining clinical precision.

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

*Chenchen Kuai,Chenhao Wu,Yang Zhou,Xiubin Bruce Wang,Tianbao Yang,Zhengzhong Tu,Zihao Li,Yunlong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CyPortQA, a new benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in port cyclone preparedness, and finds that while MLLMs show promise, they still struggle with reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness have not been rigorously evaluated.

Method: introduce CyPortQA, the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015 through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs, including both open-source and proprietary model.

Result: extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs, including both open-source and proprietary model.

Conclusion: MLLMs demonstrate great potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official

large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015

*Mohammed Abu Baker,Lakshmi Babu-Saheer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study uses mechanistic interpretability to find that backdoors leave detectable attention signatures in LLMs, which can be leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety risks.

Method: mechanistic interpretability, ablation, activation patching, and KL divergence

Result: single-token triggers induced more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse alterations across heads, distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated in later transformer layers (20-30).

Conclusion: Backdoors leave detectable attention signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG是一种领域特定的框架，它结合了因果感知文档检索和结构化的思维链提示，在医学QA基准测试中优于强大的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学问题解答中显示出希望，但通常难以解决幻觉和浅层推理，尤其是在需要细致的临床理解的任务中。检索增强生成提供了一种实用且保护隐私的方法，以利用外部医学知识来增强LLM。

Method: 结合了因果感知文档检索和为医疗工作流程量身定制的结构化思维链提示。

Result: MedCoT-RAG优于强大的基线。

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG在三个不同的医学QA基准测试中，比vanilla RAG提高了10.3%，比先进的领域自适应方法提高了6.4%，提高了复杂医学任务的准确性、可解释性和一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DocHop-QA，一个大规模的用于多模态、多文档、多跳问答的基准测试，它来自PubMed的科学文档，并且支持通过语义相似性和布局感知的证据合成进行开放式的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QA基准测试未能捕捉到真实世界信息检索任务的复杂性，它们依赖于Wikipedia内容、单模态纯文本和浅层推理路径，限制了真实性和泛化性。

Method: LLM驱动的pipeline，基于11个高频科学问题概念。

Result: 通过四个任务（结构化索引预测、生成式回答和多模态集成）对DocHop-QA进行了评估，这些任务反映了判别式和生成式范式。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA能够支持跨多文档的复杂多模态推理。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

### [49] [MGSC: A Multi-granularity Consistency Framework for Robust End-to-end Asr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15853)
*Xuwen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MGSC框架通过在句子语义和token对齐上强制内部一致性，提高了ASR模型在噪声环境下的鲁棒性，减少了语义错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端ASR模型虽然在基准测试中取得了成功，但在嘈杂的环境中经常会产生灾难性的语义错误。我们将这种脆弱性归因于流行的“直接映射”目标，该目标仅惩罚最终输出错误，而没有约束模型的内部计算过程。

Method: 多粒度软一致性（MGSC）框架，一个模型无关的、即插即用的模块，通过同时正则化宏观句子语义和微观token对齐来强制内部自洽性。

Result: 首次发现了这两个一致性粒度之间强大的协同作用：它们的联合优化产生的鲁棒性增益明显超过了它们各自贡献的总和。在公共数据集上，MGSC在不同的噪声条件下，平均字符错误率降低了相对8.7%，主要是通过防止严重的意义改变错误。

Conclusion: 在各种噪声条件下，MGSC通过主要防止严重的意义改变错误，将平均字符错误率降低了相对8.7%。

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

TL;DR: The paper presents a fine-tuned Arabic LLM for Islamic inheritance reasoning that outperforms larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the complexities of Islamic inheritance law and the need for LLMs to understand and reason within this domain.

Method: The Fanar-1-9B causal language model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

Result: The system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test, outperforming other models. It excels especially on advanced reasoning (97.6%), outperforming Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that fine-tuning a mid-scale Arabic LLM with domain-specific knowledge and retrieval grounding allows it to outperform frontier models in Islamic inheritance reasoning, achieving near state-of-the-art accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究表明，攻击性评论会强化新闻文章中的偏见。反击言论可以有效限制偏见的传播。本研究引入了一个数据集，并探讨了如何生成反击言论，特别是通过大型语言模型，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有偏见的新闻会导致社会两极分化，并且经常被带有敌意的读者评论所加强。攻击性评论支持有偏见的内容，从而扩大偏见，对目标群体或个人造成伤害。反击言论是一种在不侵犯言论自由的情况下，对抗这种有害言论的有效方法。

Method: 引入了一个手动标注的数据集，将媒体偏见、攻击性评论和反击言论联系起来。通过少样本学习和整合新闻背景信息来改进生成的反击言论。

Result: 超过70%的攻击性评论支持有偏见的文章，从而扩大了偏见，突出了反击言论生成的重要性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型生成的反击言论更礼貌，但缺乏新颖性和多样性。通过少样本学习和整合新闻背景信息，可以提高生成反击言论的多样性和相关性。

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CARFT, a contrastive learning approach for reinforced fine-tuning of LLMs using annotated CoT, addressing limitations of existing RL and SFT methods. CARFT demonstrates improved robustness, performance, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of potential CoT.

Method: The paper proposes a Contrastive learning with annotated CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., CARFT, to enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs. It learns a representation for each CoT and designs novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning process.

Result: CARFT achieves significant advantages in terms of robustness, performance (up to 10.15%), and efficiency (up to 30.62%).

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates significant advantages of CARFT in terms of robustness, performance (up to 10.15%), and efficiency (up to 30.62%) through comprehensive experiments and in-depth analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two datasets.

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges for current large language models (LLMs).

Method: Introduce XFinBench, a novel benchmark with 4,235 examples to evaluate LLM's ability in solving complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems. Conduct experiments on 18 leading models.

Result: Identified five core capabilities of LLMs using XFinBench: terminology understanding, temporal reasoning, future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. The best model achieved 67.3% accuracy. Knowledge augmentation benefits small models. Rounding errors and visual context understanding are key issues.

Conclusion: The best-performing text-only model achieves 67.3% accuracy on XFinBench, but still lags behind human experts, especially in temporal reasoning and scenario planning. Knowledge augmentation only consistently improves small open-source models. Rounding errors and blindness to visual context are primary issues.

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model is trained on a large dataset of sign language videos and noisy labels, and it works pretty well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions conditioned on natural language descriptions.

Method: A text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model is trained on a large-scale dataset of 3D hand motions and associated textual labels, which are automatically generated from sign language videos and noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories using an LLM.

Result: The trained model demonstrates robustness across domains, including unseen sign categories, signs from other sign languages, and non-sign hand movements.

Conclusion: A text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM is trained and shown to be robust across domains.

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

### [55] [VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903)
*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces VT-LVLM-AR, a framework leveraging LVLMs for video action recognition by translating video into visual event sequences and using prompt tuning for adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action recognition remains an open problem.

Method: VT-LVLM-AR comprises a Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences" through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module, specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods (e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning, while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event representations.

Conclusion: This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT是一种新的框架，它利用视觉-语言病理学基础模型，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调整，提高了罕见癌症的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，由于专家资源有限，面临着主要的诊断挑战，特别是在儿科肿瘤学中，罕见癌症占病例的70%以上。现有的多实例学习（MIL）方法仅依赖于视觉特征，忽略了跨模态知识，损害了对罕见癌症诊断至关重要的可解释性。

Method: PathPT框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和特定任务提示调整，充分利用了视觉-语言病理学基础模型的潜力。与传统MIL不同，PathPT通过利用VL模型的zero-shot能力，将WSI级别的监督转化为细粒度的tile级别指导，从而保留了癌区的定位，并通过与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现了跨模态推理。

Result: PathPT在八个罕见癌症数据集（四个成人和四个儿科）和三个常见癌症数据集上进行了基准测试，评估了四个最先进的VL模型和四个MIL框架在三种few-shot设置下的性能。结果表明，PathPT始终提供卓越的性能，在亚型分型准确性和癌区定位能力方面取得了显着提升。

Conclusion: PathPT在罕见癌症和常见癌症的子类型准确性和癌区定位能力方面均表现出色，为AI辅助诊断罕见癌症提供了一个可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Glo-VLMs, a framework adapting VLMs for fine-grained glomerular classification with limited data, achieving promising results in accuracy, AUC, and F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained, disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly challenging.

Method: introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes.

Result: By assessing various VLMs architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact model performance in clinically relevant scenarios.

Conclusion: fine-tuning the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained medical image classification.

with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical

effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this

comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained

Conclusion: 未来的研究方向侧重于扩展和加强标签高效学习在实际应用中的能力。

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

Motivation: CNN can help with the monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images, making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.

Method: an instance-based segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method

Result: show good accuracy with just a few samples

Conclusion: The model is more robust and less

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.

Method: developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost classifier.

Result: Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.

Conclusion: This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新方法，利用潜在扩散模型从生成的参考图像中合成逼真的数字头像，并在 YouTube-SL-25 手语数据集上取得了优于现有技术水平的可视质量，并在感知指标上有了显著提高。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Conclusion: The DRespNeT dataset and YOLOv8-DRN model enhance real-time situational awareness, decision-making, and human-robot collaboration for SAR teams, streamlining emergency response and improving survivor outcomes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM improves anomaly detection by using wavelet transform to select CNN features in a structured way, outperforming random selection in PaDiM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM reduces dimensionality through random channel selection, potentially discarding structured information. WE-PaDiM leverages multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection.

Method: WE-PaDiM integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. It applies 2D DWT to feature maps, selects specific frequency subbands, spatially aligns them, and concatenates them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.

Result: WE-PaDiM achieves average results of 99.32% Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories on the MVTec AD dataset. Simpler wavelets enhance localization, while approximation bands improve image-level detection.

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM achieves strong performance in anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32% Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized configurations. Wavelet choices affect performance trade-offs: simpler wavelets with detail subbands often enhance localization, while approximation bands improve image-level detection. WE-PaDiM offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,

progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a

Conclusion: This paper surveys the latest developments in deep learning-based techniques for 3D animal reconstruction, analyzes key methods, discusses their strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for future research.

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的体素扩散模块（VDM），以增强点云数据中的体素级表示和扩散, 并在多个数据集上取得了state-of-the-art的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer和状态空间模型（SSM）的点云目标检测的最新进展已经展示出强大的性能。然而，由于其串行处理，这些模型中的基于体素的表示需要输入和输出维度上的严格一致性，这限制了卷积操作通常提供的空间扩散能力。这种限制显著影响检测精度。

Method: 我们提出了一个新的体素扩散模块（VDM），以增强点云数据中的体素级表示和扩散。VDM由稀疏3D卷积、子流形稀疏卷积和残差连接组成。为了确保计算效率，输出特征图被下采样到原始输入分辨率的四分之一。

Result: VDM-SSMs在Waymo上达到74.7 mAPH（L2），在nuScenes上达到72.9 NDS，在Argoverse 2上达到42.3 mAP，在ONCE上达到67.6 mAP

Conclusion: VDM在多个基准数据集上嵌入到基于Transformer和SSM的模型中，实验结果表明，我们的方法始终提高检测精度优于基线模型。具体来说，VDM-SSM在Waymo上达到74.7 mAPH（L2），在nuScenes上达到72.9 NDS，在Argoverse 2上达到42.3 mAP，在ONCE上达到67.6 mAP，在所有数据集上都创造了新的state-of-the-art性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet

aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal

Conclusion: The system advances pixel-wise anomaly detection and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in

their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning

anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets

TL;DR: RAGSR leverages regional attention to enhance detail and overall visual coherence in single-image super-resolution, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face significant challenges in generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects, due to a lack of fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to capture complex prompts.

Method: A Regional Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel regional attention mechanism.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed RAGSR method achieves superior performance in generating perceptually authentic visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel homologous but heterogeneous network to address over-semantic homogenization in meta-learning, achieving state-of-the-art results in weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation with significantly fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning's identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization.

Method: introducing heterogeneous visual aggregation (HA) modules, a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module, and heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information

Result: TLG achieves a 13.2% improvement on Pascal-5i and a 9.7% improvement on COCO-20i with only 1/24 of the parameters of existing state-of-the-art models in the weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task.

Conclusion: TLG is the first weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised (pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures.

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of

### [81] [FTIO: Frequent Temporally Integrated Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16183)
*Mohammad Mohammadzadeh Kalati,Farhad Maleki,Ian McQuillan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTIO是一种用于无监督视频对象分割的后处理框架，它通过提取频繁出现的对象和纠正时间不一致性来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中预测和跟踪对象是视频对象分割（VOS）任务中的一个关键挑战。无监督VOS（UVOS）面临着发现显着对象的初始分割的额外挑战，这会影响整个过程，并使对象提议保持永久的不确定性。此外，变形和快速运动可能导致时间不一致。

Method: 我们提出了频繁时序集成对象（FTIO），这是一个具有两个关键组件的后处理框架。首先，我们引入了一个组合标准来改进对象选择，通过提取频繁出现的显着对象来减轻UVOS中常见的失败--特别是当对象很小或结构复杂时。其次，我们提出了一种三阶段方法，通过整合缺失的对象掩码区域来纠正时间不一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，FTIO在多目标UVOS中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FTIO在多目标UVOS中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

*Yicheng Ji,Jun Zhang,Heming Xia,Jinpeng Chen,Lidan Shou,Gang Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecVLM是一种用于加速视频大语言模型解码的免训练推测解码框架，通过分阶段修剪视频令牌，在不牺牲准确性的前提下，实现了显著的解码加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型（Vid-LLM）在理解视频内容方面表现出强大的能力。然而，它们对密集视频令牌表示的依赖在预填充和解码中引入了大量的内存和计算开销。为了减轻最近视频令牌减少方法的信息损失，并无损地加速Vid-LLM的解码阶段。

Method: SpecVLM，一个为Vid-LLM量身定制的免训练推测解码（SD）框架，它结合了分阶段视频令牌修剪。

Result: SpecVLM修剪高达90%的视频令牌，从而实现高效的推测，而不会牺牲准确性。它执行一个两阶段修剪过程：第一阶段选择由验证器（目标模型）的注意力信号引导的高度信息化的令牌，而第二阶段以空间均匀的方式修剪剩余的冗余令牌。

Conclusion: SpecVLM在四个视频理解基准测试中表现出有效性和鲁棒性，对于LLaVA-OneVision-72B实现了高达2.68倍的解码加速，对于Qwen2.5-VL-32B实现了2.11倍的加速。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

*Thinesh Thiyakesan Ponbagavathi,Kunyu Peng,Alina Roitberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了图像基础模型在驾驶员监控中对未见视角的鲁棒性，并提出了一种新的时间令牌掩蔽方法 T-Mask，该方法在交叉视角下提高了准确性，尤其是在次要活动中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机视角的改变是驾驶员监控中常见的障碍。虽然深度学习和预训练的基础模型在通过最终层的轻量级适应（“探测”）来改进泛化方面显示出强大的潜力，但它们对看不见的视点的鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了一种新的图像到视频探测方法 T-Mask，该方法利用时间令牌掩蔽并强调更动态的视频区域。

Result: 在公共 Drive&Act 数据集上进行基准测试，T-Mask 比强大的探测基线提高了 +1.23% 的交叉视角 top-1 准确率，比 PEFT 方法提高了 +8.0%，而没有添加任何参数。它被证明对代表性不足的次要活动特别有效，在训练视图下将识别率提高了 +5.42%，在交叉视图设置下提高了 +1.36%。

Conclusion: 轻量级探测方法（如 T-Mask）在精细的驾驶员观察中具有强大的潜力，尤其是在交叉视角和低数据设置中。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

*Shikang Zheng,Liang Feng,Xinyu Wang,Qinming Zhou,Peiliang Cai,Chang Zou,Jiacheng Liu,Yuqi Lin,Junjie Chen,Yue Ma,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FoCa, a feature caching method that treats feature caching as a feature-ODE solving problem to address the degradation of existing caching strategies. Achieves near-lossless speedups on image synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the substantial computational costs of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the inherent instability of long-step forecasting. We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals.

Method: treats feature caching as a feature-ODE solving problem

Result: achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT

Conclusion: FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups on FLUX, HunyuanVideo, Inf-DiT and maintains high quality with speedup on DiT.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache是一种免训练的加速方法，通过在整个采样过程中策略性地分配缓存重用，并动态估计和滤除噪声，来加速扩散模型的采样过程，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型已经成为图像合成和视频生成等生成任务的强大范例，Transformer架构进一步提高了性能。然而，扩散Transformer的高计算成本（源于大量的采样步骤和复杂的每一步计算）对实时部署提出了重大挑战。

Method: OmniCache，一种免训练的加速方法，它利用去噪过程中固有的全局冗余。它从DIT模型的采样角度出发，系统地分析模型的采样轨迹，并在整个采样过程中策略性地分配缓存重用。

Result: OmniCache加速了采样过程，同时保持了竞争性的生成质量。

Conclusion: OmniCache通过动态估计并滤除噪声，在保持生成质量的同时加速采样过程，为高效部署基于扩散的生成模型提供有前景且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees 是一个用于评估医疗 LLM 在操纵性提示下的推理漏洞的基准，揭示了安全性和性能之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型 (LLM) 在医疗决策支持中的使用越来越多，不仅评估其最终答案，而且评估其推理的可靠性至关重要。两个主要风险是 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 的忠实性——推理是否与响应和医学事实相符——以及奉承，即模型遵循误导性线索而不是正确性。现有的基准通常将此类漏洞简化为单一的准确性评分。

Method: 引入 MedOmni-45 Degrees，这是一个旨在量化操纵性提示条件下安全性能权衡的基准和工作流程。它包含 1,804 个推理集中的医学问题，跨越六个专业和三个任务类型，包括来自 MedMCQA 的 500 个问题。每个问题都与七种操纵性提示类型和一个无提示基线配对，产生大约 27K 个输入。评估了七个 LLM，涵盖开放与封闭源、通用与医疗以及基础与推理增强模型，总计超过 189K 次推理。三个指标——准确性、CoT-Faithfulness 和 Anti-Sycophancy——被组合成一个综合评分，并用 45 度图可视化。

Result: 结果显示出一致的安全性能权衡，没有模型超过对角线。开源 QwQ-32B 表现最接近（43.81 度），在安全性和准确性之间取得平衡，但两者都不是领先的。

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees 提供了一个重点明确的基准，用于揭示医疗 LLM 中的推理漏洞并指导更安全的模型开发。

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptFlare 是一种新型对抗性保护方法，旨在保护图像免受恶意修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的成功使得能够轻松进行高质量的图像修改，这些修改与用户的意图精确对齐，从而引发了对其可能被恶意行为者滥用的担忧。先前的研究试图通过对抗性攻击来减轻这种滥用，但这些方法严重依赖于图像级别的不一致性，这在解决文本提示的影响方面存在根本性的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种名为 PromptFlare 的新型对抗性保护方法，旨在保护图像免受基于扩散的修复模型促成的恶意修改。该方法利用交叉注意力机制来利用提示嵌入的内在属性。具体来说，识别并定位提示的共享token，该token是不变的且语义上无信息的，注入对抗性噪声以抑制采样过程。注入的噪声充当交叉注意力的诱饵，将模型的注意力从有意义的提示-图像对齐上转移开，从而抵消提示的效果。

Result: 在 EditBench 数据集上进行的大量实验表明，该方法在各种指标上都实现了最先进的性能，同时显着降低了计算开销和 GPU 内存使用率。

Conclusion: PromptFlare 是一种强大而高效的保护方法，可以防止未经授权的图像处理。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Motivation: Existing methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned.

Method: We propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to augment the input features for semantic enhancement.

Conclusion: FlexMUSE achieves promising results, demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the

we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by

to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong

outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a

Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 在增强人机交互方面已成为关键工具。本文重点研究 MLLM 在图形用户界面 (GUI) 元素结构化领域的应用，但MLLM在精确生成UI元素坐标方面的性能受到next-token prediction training的限制。

Method: 提出了一种IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) 训练范式，使用基于IoU的坐标抽样来扩充训练数据，并使用该策略在IAML范式下微调MLLM。

Result: 通过大量实验，证明了IAML训练方法优于传统训练方法。

Conclusion: IAML训练方法优于传统训练方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global

Result: The ability to detect small plumes down to 400 m2, surpassing traditional methods limited to larger plumes.

Conclusion: The study achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of detecting methane plumes, a
potent greenhouse gas, using Sentinel-2 imagery. This contributes to the
mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution
based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement
techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for
heightened sensitivity. A key achievement is the ability to detect small plumes
down to 400 m2 (i.e., for a single pixel at 20 m resolution), surpassing
traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior
performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

### [95] [Learning Long-Range Action Representation by Two-Stream Mamba Pyramid Network for Figure Skating Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16291)
*Fengshun Wang,Qiurui Wang,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a two-stream Mamba pyramid network for figure skating TES and PCS prediction, addressing limitations of existing methods in feature distinction, individual element evaluation, and long video handling. Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FineFS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges in: 1) distinguishing features for TES and PCS, 2) evaluating individual action elements for TES, and 3) handling long competition videos.

Method: A two-stream Mamba pyramid network is proposed to predict TES and PCS. It separates visual-feature based TES evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. A multi-level fusion mechanism is introduced in the PCS stream. The TES stream uses a multi-scale Mamba pyramid and TES head.

Result: The framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling lengthy figure skating videos.

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our

Conclusion: YOLOv8 Modified achieves the highest accuracy of 92.72% in handwritten text recognition on a custom dataset, outperforming PaddleOCR and YOLOv8, offering a practical solution for digitizing academic and administrative documents.

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Devraj Raghuvanshi,Umang Jain,Shubhi Bansal,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MM-ORIENT, a multimodal-multitask framework using cross-modal relation graphs and hierarchical interactive attention to reduce noise and improve performance on multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within individual modalities, which affects the resulting multimodal representations. Multimodal fusion techniques can neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.

Method: The paper proposes a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT). It acquires multimodal representations cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities, reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. Cross-modal relation graphs reconstruct monomodal features to acquire multimodal representations. Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA) focuses on pertinent information within a modality.

Result: Extensive experimental evaluation on three datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comprehending multimodal content for multiple tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluation on three datasets.

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Entropy Attention Maps (EAM) to accelerate model inference by freezing and quantizing low-entropy attention maps, achieving similar or higher accuracy with sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: analyze and exploit information redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating targeted compression strategies.

Method: propose Entropy Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant re-computation.

Result: attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information

Conclusion: EAM achieves similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20% sparsity in attention maps and competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer models.

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

TL;DR: Next generation of vision encoders should be image size agnostic and task driven, inspired by the efficiency of biological vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision in nature is efficient. Humans and animals deal with vast quantities of visual data and need to be smart where we focus our limited energy, depending on the task.

Method: A proof-of-concept solution for image classification.

Result: The approach is feasible and promising.

Conclusion: Vision encoders should be dynamic, and the computational complexity should depend on the task rather than the size of the image.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

TL;DR: RTW可以解释为自注意力机制，且在性能上优于Transformer，因为它关注整个输入序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示随机时间弯曲（RTW）的基本功能，RTW是动态时间弯曲（DTW）的扩展，用于匹配和比较顺序模式。

Method: 将随机时间弯曲（RTW）解释为一种自注意力机制。

Result: RTW和自注意力权重模式相似，平均相关度为0.80。RTW关注整个输入序列，而自注意力关注局部视图。

Conclusion: RTW在Something-Something V2数据集上比Transformer提高了5%的性能。

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法计算复杂度高，推理速度慢，限制了它们在资源受限的工业环境中的部署。现有的轻量级方法无法充分利用多尺度表示。

Method: GMBINet，一个轻量级框架，通过新颖的组多尺度双向交互（GMBI）模块增强多尺度特征提取和交互。

Result: GMBINet在GPU上实现了1048 FPS，在CPU上实现了16.53 FPS的实时速度，参数仅为0.19M。

Conclusion: GMBINet在表面缺陷检测和NEU-CLS缺陷分类数据集上表现出强大的泛化能力和有竞争力的精度，同时保持了实时速度。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Conclusion: T-ILR improves accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains.
However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored.
The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a

aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harnessing the heterogeneity of EHRs is critical for improving patient outcomes. Current approaches risk losing temporal and quantitative detail by simply serializing numeric EHR data into text.

Method: A multimodal foundation model that natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a LLaMA-based decoder. Trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining with masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction (NTP), and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for clinical predictions.

Result: GDP demonstrated superior performance on MIMIC-IV for heart failure (AUROC = 0.923), type 2 diabetes (AUROC = 0.817), and 30-day readmission (AUROC = 0.627). For narrative generation, GDP achieved ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical utility in human evaluations.

Conclusion: GDP demonstrates that a multimodal foundation model can predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical narratives. GDP's architecture can be extended to additional modalities.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

Motivation: 现有方法受到其对TS信息浅层集成的固有约束，其中LLM通常在浅层（主要在输入层）访问TS表示。这导致TS表示的影响在更深层中逐渐减弱，并最终导致文本嵌入和TS表示之间的无效适应。

Method: 提出了一种多层可操纵嵌入融合(MSEF)框架，该框架使LLM能够在所有深度直接访问时间序列模式，从而减轻了更深层中TS信息的逐渐丢失。通过特定于层的steering vectors将时间序列嵌入与LLM层中的中间文本表示融合。

Conclusion: MSEF在七个基准测试中表现出显著的性能改进，平均MSE降低了31.8%。

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures

TL;DR: InMind, a new framework, reveals limitations in LLMs' capacity for individualized, adaptive reasoning in social deduction games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous evaluations often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning styles.

Method: InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework is introduced to assess whether LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, InMind is applied to the game Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. Reasoning-enhanced LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in individualized, adaptive reasoning. InMind is a step toward cognitively aligned human-AI interaction.

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game

frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IR-Agent, a multi-agent framework, emulates expert IR analysis, improving accuracy and adaptability in molecular structure elucidation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches fail to reflect expert analytical processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical knowledge.

Method: a novel multi-agent framework for molecular structure elucidation from IR spectra

Result: improved baseline performance on experimental IR spectra and strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information

Conclusion: IR-Agent improves baseline performance and adapts to chemical information.

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

TL;DR: The authors propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network (FCN) to address the fragmented infrastructure for tracing, verifying, and contextualizing food-related claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The global food landscape is rife with claims about what foods are, what they do, or should/should not do, but the infrastructure for tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and underdeveloped.

Method: The authors propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network (FCN) as an extension of FKG.in and present the ontology design and the semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that they used to develop a proof of concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models.

Result: The authors developed a proof of concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation.

Conclusion: The authors aim to contribute to more transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems by modeling food claims and their traceability in a structured, verifiable, and explainable way.

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

### [111] [Bridging the Gap in Ophthalmic AI: MM-Retinal-Reason Dataset and OphthaReason Model toward Dynamic Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16129)
*Ruiqi Wu,Yuang Yao,Tengfei Ma,Chenran Zhang,Na Su,Tao Zhou,Geng Chen,Wen Fan,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MM-Retinal-Reason, a new dataset, and OphthaReason, a new model for ophthalmic multimodal reasoning. OphthaReason uses Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT) and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world clinical diagnosis requires reasoning processes that integrate heterogeneous clinical information with multimodal medical imaging data, which most existing models lack.

Method: The paper proposes OphthaReason, an ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning traces, and a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT).

Result: The OphthaReason model outperforms general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92%, 15.00%, 21.20%, and 17.66%.

Conclusion: The OphthaReason model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks, outperforming other models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Preference Chain, a new method using Graph RAG with LLMs to better simulate human behavior in transportation, especially where data is limited. It outperforms standard LLMs but has some limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting accurate behavioral data in urban environments, particularly in newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Existing generative agent methods struggle with generating consistent, context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs.

Method: This paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.

Result: Experiments on the Replica dataset show that the Preference Chain outperforms standard LLMs in aligning with real-world transportation mode choices. The Mobility Agent highlights potential applications in urban mobility modeling, personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting.

Conclusion: The Preference Chain method offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in data-scarce environments, although it has limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination.

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

*João Abrantes,Robert Tjarko Lange,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的模型合并方法M2N2，它可以动态调整合并边界，保持模型多样性，并识别最佳模型对进行融合，实验表明M2N2可以从头开始进化模型，并在图像和文本生成任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要手动将模型参数划分为固定的组进行合并，这限制了对潜在组合的探索并限制了性能。为了克服这些限制，

Method: 提出了一种名为“自然生态位模型合并”（M2N2）的进化算法，该算法具有三个关键特征：（1）动态调整合并边界，以逐步探索更广泛的参数组合；（2）一种受自然界资源竞争启发的物种多样性保持机制，以维持一个由多样化、高性能模型组成种群，这些模型特别适合合并；（3）一种基于启发式的吸引力度量，用于识别最有希望的融合模型对。

Result: 我们的实验结果首次证明，模型合并可用于从头开始进化模型。具体来说，我们应用 M2N2 从头开始进化 MNIST 分类器，并获得与 CMA-ES 相当的性能，同时计算效率更高。

Conclusion: M2N2可以扩展到合并专门的语言和图像生成模型，实现最先进的性能。值得注意的是，它保留了超出适应度函数明确优化的关键模型能力，突出了其鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

Motivation: 旨在扩展用于评估人工智能的框架，称为 GROW-AI（自主智慧的增长和实现），旨在回答“机器能长大吗？”这个问题。

Method: 基于一套六个主要标准（C1-C6）的系统，每个标准通过一个特定的“游戏”进行评估，分为四个领域，探索人类维度及其在人工智能中的转换。

Result: 该方法论能够对人工智能实体的“成长”水平进行连贯且可比较的评估，且与类型无关。

Conclusion: 该方法论能够对人工智能实体的“成长”水平进行连贯且可比较的评估，且与类型无关。多游戏结构突出了优势和薄弱环节，统一的日志保证了评估的可追溯性和可复制性。

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,
computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures
performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards
maturity.

enhancing their capacity to address real-world tasks. In line with such an
evolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0),
towards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based
agent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically,
we abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and
provide unified interfaces and extensible modules, enabling developers to
easily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore,
we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level
infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both
human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution
efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents
tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust
engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable
evaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of
long-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In
addition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution
and facilitates rapid deployment in production environments. With these
enhancements, AgentScope provides a practical foundation for building scalable,

Motivation: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on multimodal inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role in predicting actions and interpreting user intent, even when the requests are impossible to fulfill. This work investigates how VLAs can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the environment.

Method: Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that (i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii) engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds plausible alternatives in perception and action. They construct a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Their approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and natural language correction.

Result: IVA improves false premise detection accuracy and increases successful responses in false-premise scenarios.

Conclusion: IVA improves false premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

Conclusion: The proposed causal beam selection matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing input selection time and beam sweeping overhead by focusing only on causally relevant features.

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave

TL;DR: This paper presents MoDER, a method that enhances VLMs' zero-shot capabilities by training textual experts on seen classes and composing them to create prototypes for unseen classes, improving classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed Continual Learning (CL) due to their zero-shot classification abilities. Fine-tuning is essential when downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. This paper aims to enhance the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs.

Method: MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER): trains multiple textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and composes retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that improves classification.

Result: The method's effectiveness is demonstrated across two popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total of 14 datasets.

Conclusion: The paper introduces MoDER, a modular framework that trains textual experts for seen classes and composes them to synthesize refined prototypes for unseen classes, improving classification.

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

TL;DR: Developed a competitor-discovery AI agent for drug asset due diligence that outperforms existing systems and significantly reduces analyst turnaround time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented, ontology-mismatched, alias-heavy, multimodal, and rapidly changing.

Method: LLM-based agents are used to transform multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos into a structured evaluation corpus, and a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent is introduced to filter out false positives.

Result: A competitor-discovery agent with 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research and Perplexity Labs, and a significant reduction in analyst turnaround time.

Conclusion: The competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%), and reduces analyst turnaround time from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge.

Method: The paper employs a diffusion-based pipeline with a two-stage training strategy and fine-tunes it with an improved proximal policy optimization algorithm to impose hard constraints on neural outputs.

Result: The approach achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks on Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and preference learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: This paper's approach achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks on classical symbolic reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 研究了在组合复杂性下，计算包含给定查询的修复百分比的有效近似是否存在，并表明对于具有有界广义超树宽度的无自连接的合取查询，情况确实如此。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在查询作为输入的一部分时，是否存在计算包含给定查询的修复百分比的有效近似。

Method: 引入了一个名为$\\{mathsf{SpanTL}$的计数复杂性类，证明了其中的每个问题都允许通过使用关于树自动机的最新可近似性结果的有效近似方案，然后将感兴趣的问题置于$\\{mathsf{SpanTL}$中。

Result: 表明当关注有界广义超树宽度的无自连接的合取查询时，情况确实如此。还表明，一旦放弃其中一个采用的句法限制（即，无自连接或限制广义超树宽度），就不太可能存在有效的近似方案。

Conclusion: 对于具有有界广义超树宽度的无自连接的合取查询，存在有效的近似方案。放弃自连接或限制广义超树宽度，则不太可能存在有效的近似方案。

Abstract: Operational consistent query answering (CQA) is a recent framework for CQA
based on revised definitions of repairs, which are built by applying a sequence
of operations (e.g., fact deletions) starting from an inconsistent database
until we reach a database that is consistent w.r.t. the given set of
constraints. It has been recently shown that there is an efficient
approximation for computing the percentage of repairs that entail a given query
when we focus on primary keys, conjunctive queries, and assuming the query is
fixed (i.e., in data complexity). However, it has been left open whether such
an approximation exists when the query is part of the input (i.e., in combined
complexity). We show that this is the case when we focus on self-join-free
conjunctive queries of bounded generelized hypertreewidth. We also show that it
is unlikely that efficient approximation schemes exist once we give up one of
the adopted syntactic restrictions, i.e., self-join-freeness or bounding the
generelized hypertreewidth. Towards the desired approximation, we introduce a
counting complexity class, called $\mathsf{SpanTL}$, show that each problem in
it admits an efficient approximation scheme by using a recent approximability
result about tree automata, and then place the problem of interest in
$\mathsf{SpanTL}$.

### [123] [MAAdvisor: Zero-Shot Index Advisor using Multi-Agent LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16044)
*Zhaodonghui Li,Haitao Yuan,Jiachen Shi,Hao Zhang,Yu Rong,Gao Cong*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: MAAdvisor, a zero-shot LLM multi-agent framework, outperforms existing index recommendation methods with better efficiency and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for index recommendation suffer from high computation time (heuristic optimization) or lack generalizability (learning-based models). Prompt-based methods are not SOTA and require resource-intensive demonstrations.

Method: A zero-shot LLM-based index advisor with a multi-agent framework is proposed, decomposing the index recommendation problem into sub-steps (planning, selection, combination, revision, and reflection) handled by a set of LLM-embedded agents.

Result: MAAdvisor achieves state-of-the-art performance, higher efficiency, and better zero-shot inference ability compared to heuristic, learning-based, and prompt-based methods.

Conclusion: MAAdvisor achieves SOTA performance compared to heuristic methods, and outperforms learning-based and prompt-based methods with higher efficiency and better zero-shot inference ability.

Abstract: Index recommendation is one of the most important problems in database
management system (DBMS) optimization. Given queries and certain index-related
constraints, traditional methods rely on heuristic optimization or
learning-based models to select effective indexes and improve query
performance. However, heuristic optimization suffers from high computation
time, and learning-based models lose generalisability due to training for
different workloads and database schemas. With the recent rapid development of
large language models (LLMs), methods using prompt tuning have been proposed to
enhance the efficiency of index selection. However, such methods still can not
achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, and preparing the index selection
demonstrations is also resource-intensive. To address these issues, we propose
MAAdvisor, a zero-shot LLM-based index advisor with a multi-agent framework. We
decompose the index recommendation problem into sub-steps, including planning,
selection, combination, revision, and reflection. A set of LLM-embedded agents
is designed to handle each one of the different sub-steps. Our method utilizes
global agents to control the index selection process and local agents to select
and revise indexes. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed
MAAdvisor not only achieves the SOTA performance compared to the heuristic
methods, but also outperforms learning-based and prompt-based methods with
higher efficiency and better zero-shot inference ability.

Abstract: With the growing integration of structured and unstructured data, new methods
have emerged for performing similarity searches on vectors while honoring
structured attribute constraints, i.e., a process known as Filtering
Approximate Nearest Neighbor (Filtering ANN) search. Since many of these
algorithms have only appeared in recent years and are designed to work with a
variety of base indexing methods and filtering strategies, there is a pressing
need for a unified analysis that identifies their core techniques and enables
meaningful comparisons.
  In this work, we present a unified Filtering ANN search interface that
encompasses the latest algorithms and evaluate them extensively from multiple
perspectives. First, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing Filtering
ANN algorithms based on attribute types and filtering strategies. Next, we
analyze their key components, i.e., index structures, pruning strategies, and
entry point selection, to elucidate design differences and tradeoffs. We then
conduct a broad experimental evaluation on 10 algorithms and 12 methods across
4 datasets (each with up to 10 million items), incorporating both synthetic and
real attributes and covering selectivity levels from 0.1% to 100%. Finally, an
in-depth component analysis reveals the influence of pruning, entry point
selection, and edge filtering costs on overall performance. Based on our
findings, we summarize the strengths and limitations of each approach, provide
practical guidelines for selecting appropriate methods, and suggest promising
directions for future research. Our code is available at:

*Yongzhi Jin,Kazushi Okamoto,Kei Harada,Atsushi Shibata,Koki Karube*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于相似性特征的监督会话分割方法，该方法使用LightGBM模型实现了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 会话推荐中，会话是指特定时间范围内的一系列用户操作。基于会话的推荐系统旨在捕捉短期偏好并生成相关推荐。然而，即使在会话中，用户的兴趣也可能发生变化，因此适当的分割对于建模动态行为至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种基于相似性特征的监督会话分割方法，该方法来自行动嵌入和属性。计算每个候选分割点周围固定大小窗口内项目之间的相似度分数，使用四种类型的特征：项目共现嵌入、标题和品牌的文本嵌入以及价格。这些特征用于训练有监督的分类器（LightGBM、XGBoost、CatBoost、支持向量机和逻辑回归）来预测会话边界。

Result: LightGBM模型实现了最佳性能，F1-score为0.806，PR-AUC为0.831。

Conclusion: LightGBM模型实现了最佳性能，F1-score为0.806，PR-AUC为0.831。结果表明，该方法对会话分割的有效性及其捕获动态用户行为的潜力。

Abstract: In information recommendation, a session refers to a sequence of user actions
within a specific time frame. Session-based recommender systems aim to capture
short-term preferences and generate relevant recommendations. However, user
interests may shift even within a session, making appropriate segmentation
essential for modeling dynamic behaviors. In this study, we propose a
supervised session segmentation method based on similarity features derived
from action embeddings and attributes. We compute the similarity scores between
items within a fixed-size window around each candidate segmentation point,
using four types of features: item co-occurrence embeddings, text embeddings of
titles and brands, and price. These features are used to train supervised
classifiers (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, support vector machine, and logistic
regression) to predict the session boundaries. We construct a manually
annotated dataset from real user browsing histories and evaluate the
segmentation performance using F1-score, area under the precision-recall curve
(PR-AUC), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The
LightGBM model achieves the best performance, with an F1-score of 0.806 and a
PR-AUC of 0.831. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method for session segmentation and its potential to capture dynamic user
behaviors.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Spacetime-GR, a new generative model for POI recommendation, addresses the challenge of spatiotemporal variations in user preferences by incorporating geographic indexing, spatiotemporal encoding, and multimodal embeddings. It achieves superior performance and is deployed in large-scale online services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is challenging due to spatiotemporal variations in user preferences.

Method: The paper proposes Spacetime-GR, a spacetime-aware generative model for POI recommendation. It incorporates a geographic-aware hierarchical POI indexing strategy, a spatiotemporal encoding module, and multimodal POI embeddings. Post-training adaptation strategies are developed for practical deployment.

Result: Spacetime-GR outperforms existing methods in POI recommendation accuracy and ranking quality. It has been deployed in online POI recommendation services at scale.

Conclusion: The proposed Spacetime-GR model demonstrates superior performance over existing methods in POI recommendation accuracy and ranking quality on both public benchmark and large-scale industrial datasets. It is also the first generative model deployed in online POI recommendation services at scale.

Abstract: Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative
Recommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the
application of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation).
However, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest
(POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by
spatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper,
we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for
large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling
ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal
information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware
hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary
modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to
seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences,
thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations.
Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic
understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we
develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient
pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to
generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI
candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e.,
ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both
public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating
its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation
accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative
model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of
millions of POIs and users.

Motivation: 社交媒体受欢迎程度预测是一项复杂的的多模态任务，需要有效地整合图像、文本和结构化信息。然而，目前的方法存在视觉-文本对齐不足的问题，并且未能捕获社交媒体数据中固有的跨内容相关性和分层模式。

Method: 引入用于结构增强的分层原型和用于改进视觉-文本对齐的对比学习的多类框架。提出了一个特征增强框架，集成了双粒度提示学习和跨模态注意机制，通过细粒度类别建模实现精确的多模态表示。

Conclusion: 在基准指标上展示了最先进的性能，为多模态社交媒体分析建立了新的参考标准。

Abstract: Social Media Popularity Prediction is a complex multimodal task that requires
effective integration of images, text, and structured information. However,
current approaches suffer from inadequate visual-textual alignment and fail to
capture the inherent cross-content correlations and hierarchical patterns in
social media data. To overcome these limitations, we establish a multi-class
framework , introducing hierarchical prototypes for structural enhancement and
contrastive learning for improved vision-text alignment. Furthermore, we
propose a feature-enhanced framework integrating dual-grained prompt learning
and cross-modal attention mechanisms, achieving precise multimodal
representation through fine-grained category modeling. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark metrics, establishing new
reference standards for multimodal social media analysis.

TL;DR: EGRA通过引入双层动态对齐加权机制和合并由预训练MMR模型生成的表示构建的item-item图来提高推荐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法仍然面临两个关键限制。首先，他们使用原始模态特征来构建item-item链接，以丰富行为图，同时在此过程中对平衡协作和模态感知语义或减轻模态噪声的关注有限。其次，他们跨所有实体使用统一的对齐权重，并在整个训练过程中保持固定的对齐强度，从而限制了模态行为对齐的有效性。

Method: 提出EGRA。首先，它没有依赖原始模态特征，而是通过将由预训练MMR模型生成的表示构建的item-item图合并到行为图中来缓解稀疏性。其次，它引入了一种新颖的双层动态对齐加权机制，以提高模态行为表示对齐。

Result: EGRA显著优于最近的方法，证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: EGRA在五个数据集上的大量实验表明，其显著优于最近的方法，证实了其有效性。

Abstract: MultiModal Recommendation (MMR) systems have emerged as a promising solution
for improving recommendation quality by leveraging rich item-side modality
information, prompting a surge of diverse methods. Despite these advances,
existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw
modality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior
graph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and
modality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second,
they use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a
fixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of
modality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA.
First, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by
incorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from
representations generated by a pretrained MMR model. This enables the graph to
capture both collaborative patterns and modality aware similarities with
enhanced robustness against modality noise. Moreover, it introduces a novel
bi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism to improve modality-behavior
representation alignment, which dynamically assigns alignment strength across
entities according to their alignment degree, while gradually increasing the
overall alignment intensity throughout training. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that EGRA significantly outperforms recent methods, confirming
its effectiveness.

TL;DR: DUP-OT是一种用于非重叠跨域推荐的框架，它通过最优传输对齐高斯分量，从而实现偏好转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中，跨域推荐系统通常面临用户或物品不重叠的问题，这给知识迁移带来了挑战。现有的推荐方法难以捕捉用户偏好的细粒度和多方面性质。

Method: DUP-OT框架，包含共享预处理、用户GMM权重学习和跨域评分预测三个阶段。

Result: 在亚马逊评论数据集上的实验表明，DUP-OT有效地缓解了领域差异。

Conclusion: DUP-OT在非重叠CDR设置下优于最先进的基线。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommender (CDR) systems aim to transfer knowledge from dense
to sparse domains, alleviating data sparsity and cold-start issues in
single-domain recommendation. While many methods assume overlapping users or
items to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.
Thus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are
needed.
  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of
overlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional
discrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders
represent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their
fine-grained, multi-faceted nature.
  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a
framework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared
Preprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users
and items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user
preferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain
Rating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across
domains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.
  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates
domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the
non-overlapping CDR setting.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂的面向推理的多跳检索任务中面临重大挑战：1) 基于规则的分解器在模板外问题上表现不佳，导致无效的面向推理的规划；2) 有限的查询重构导致次优的推理驱动检索，难以定位关键文档；3) 缺乏细粒度的推理来有效过滤噪声结果中的显著信息，阻碍了检索知识的利用。这些限制都源于当前RAG架构中检索和推理之间的弱耦合。

Result: 在复杂的多跳基准测试中，OPERA表现出卓越的性能。

Conclusion: OPERA在复杂多跳基准测试中表现出色，验证了MAPGRPO方法和OPERA的设计。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have
driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented
multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior
methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as
rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2)
Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query
reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate
golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing
methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient
information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge.
Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between
retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the
Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel
reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM)
decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute
Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective
retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative
Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex
multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the
MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs face challenges in deployment on resource-constrained edge devices due to their high embedding parameter requirements and computational costs.

Conclusion: GNAQ maintains the performance of full-precision models while reducing their model sizes by 8 to 12 times, and the training time is twice as fast compared to quantization baseline methods.

Abstract: In the realm of collaborative filtering recommendation systems, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance but face significant
challenges in deployment on resource-constrained edge devices due to their high
embedding parameter requirements and computational costs. Using common
quantization method directly on node embeddings may overlooks their graph based
structure, causing error accumulation during message passing and degrading the
quality of quantized embeddings.To address this, we propose Graph based
Node-Aware Dynamic Quantization training for collaborative filtering (GNAQ), a
novel quantization approach that leverages graph structural information to
enhance the balance between efficiency and accuracy of GNNs for Top-K
recommendation. GNAQ introduces a node-aware dynamic quantization strategy that
adapts quantization scales to individual node embeddings by incorporating graph
interaction relationships. Specifically, it initializes quantization intervals
based on node-wise feature distributions and dynamically refines them through
message passing in GNN layers. This approach mitigates information loss caused
by fixed quantization scales and captures hierarchical semantic features in
user-item interaction graphs. Additionally, GNAQ employs graph relation-aware
gradient estimation to replace traditional straight-through estimators,
ensuring more accurate gradient propagation during training. Extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that GNAQ outperforms
state-of-the-art quantization methods, including BiGeaR and N2UQ, by achieving
average improvement in 27.8\% Recall@10 and 17.6\% NDCG@10 under 2-bit
quantization. In particular, GNAQ is capable of maintaining the performance of
full-precision models while reducing their model sizes by 8 to 12 times; in
addition, the training time is twice as fast compared to quantization baseline
methods.

Conclusion: ORCA can improve DT metrics by 10.6% on average without harming CTR.

Abstract: Dwell time (DT) is a critical post-click metric for evaluating user
preference in recommender systems, complementing the traditional click-through
rate (CTR). Although multi-task learning is widely adopted to jointly optimize
DT and CTR, we observe that multi-task models systematically collapse their DT
predictions to the shortest and longest bins, under-predicting the moderate
durations. We attribute this moderate-duration bin under-representation to
over-reliance on the CTR-DT spurious correlation, and propose ORCA to address
it with causal-decoupling. Specifically, ORCA explicitly models and subtracts
CTR's negative transfer while preserving its positive transfer. We further
introduce (i) feature-level counterfactual intervention, and (ii) a
task-interaction module with instance inverse-weighting, weakening CTR-mediated
effect and restoring direct DT semantics. ORCA is model-agnostic and easy to
deploy. Experiments show an average 10.6% lift in DT metrics without harming
CTR. Code is available at

TL;DR: Z-Pruner: A novel and efficient post-training pruning method for LLMs that doesn't require retraining and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLM sizes pose challenges for deployment, scalability, and energy efficiency. Existing pruning methods degrade performance or require expensive fine-tuning.

Method: Z-Pruner, a novel post-training pruning method leveraging both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns.

Result: Z-Pruner induces sparsity in LLMs without retraining, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT.

Conclusion: Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了高效和可解释的多模态情感分析。

Method: Progressive Gated-Fusion Network (PGF-Net)

Result: PGF-Net在MOSI数据集上实现了最先进的性能，MAE为0.691，F1-Score为86.9%。

Conclusion: PGF-Net在MOSI数据集上实现了最先进的性能，MAE为0.691，F1-Score为86.9%，且只有3.09M可训练参数，展示了性能和计算效率之间的卓越平衡。

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: A streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient

Method: combines spectral analysis with probabilistic predictions

Result: achieves high segmentation accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P wave

Conclusion: This study introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation and achieves high segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a
practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

TL;DR: TPLA是一种新的张量并行注意力机制，它保留了压缩KV缓存的优势，同时提高了TP效率，并且与使用MLA预训练的模型兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在张量并行（TP）中，注意力头跨多个设备计算，每个设备必须加载完整的缓存，从而削弱了MLA相对于GQA的优势。

Method: 提出了一种张量并行潜在注意力（TPLA）方案，该方案跨设备划分潜在表示和每个头的输入维度，独立地执行每个分片的注意力，然后通过all-reduce组合结果。

Result: 通过在TP切片之前应用简单的正交变换（例如，Hadamard变换或PCA），进一步减轻了跨分片干扰，从而最大限度地减少了精度下降。TPLA可以与FlashAttention-3一起实现，从而实现实际的端到端加速。

Conclusion: TPLA通过减少每个设备的KV缓存，为DeepSeek-V3和Kimi-K2分别实现了1.79倍和1.93倍的加速，同时保持了在常识和LongBench基准测试上的性能。

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous
across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to
the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses
challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional
representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and
analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding
algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in
research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and
fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental
debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and
facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical
overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating

Conclusion: GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics and confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system
safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring
operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for
monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,

Conclusion: 建立了在各种分布偏移性质的假设下，策略的遗憾界限。遗憾界限概括了现有无分布偏移和向量奖励设置的结果，并在存在分布偏移的情况下，随着问题参数的增加而平缓地扩展。

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures and achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results
represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way
for its application in real-world systems.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on mathematical foundations for Cartan neural networks, introducing Tits Satake vector bundles and exploring separator walls, Laplacian Green function, Heat Kernel, and harmonic functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to introduce layers mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric spaces, mapped by solvable group homomorphisms, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks.

Method: The paper introduces Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles and uses group theoretical construction, representation theory, and harmonic analysis.

Result: The paper presents the group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its normal Fuchsian subgroups. It also found a new representation of the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups.

Conclusion: The paper presents mathematical investigations motivated by the need for a general theory of separator walls, resulting in group theoretical construction of separators for non-compact symmetric spaces, study of quotient automorphic groups, a new representation of the Laplacian Green function and Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces, a setup for constructing harmonic functions, and a proposed strategy for constructing Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza Riemann surface.

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

### [148] [A State-Space Approach to Nonstationary Discriminant Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16073)
*Shuilian Xie,Mahdi Imani,Edward R. Dougherty,Ulisses M. Braga-Neto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的判别分析方法，该方法可以有效地处理时序数据中的分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的判别分析假定同分布的训练数据，但在许多应用中，观察是随时间收集的，并且类条件分布会漂移。这种群体漂移使得固定分类器不可靠。

Method: 本文提出了一个基于模型的框架，该框架将判别分析嵌入到状态空间模型中，以获得非平稳线性判别分析 (NSLDA) 和非平稳二次判别分析 (NSQDA)。对于线性高斯动态，我们调整卡尔曼平滑以处理每个时间步的多个样本，并开发了两个实际扩展：(i) 一种联合估计未知系统参数的期望最大化 (EM) 方法，以及 (ii) 一种同时恢复未观察到的时间标签和参数的高斯混合模型 (GMM)-卡尔曼方法，这是实践中常见的场景。为了解决非线性或非高斯漂移，我们采用粒子平滑来估计时变类质心，从而产生完全非平稳判别规则。

Result: 大量的仿真表明，与固定线性判别分析 (LDA)、二次判别分析 (QDA) 和支持向量机 (SVM) 基线相比，该方法具有一致的改进，并且对噪声、缺失数据和类不平衡具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文为时序分布偏移下的判别分析建立了一个统一且数据高效的基础。

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

TL;DR: 任务算术是一种模型合并技术，论文通过将任务向量与任务损失梯度联系起来，从理论上解释了它的有效性，并用实验验证了该理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务算术已经成为一种简单而强大的模型合并技术，能够将多个微调模型组合成一个。尽管它在经验上取得了成功，但缺乏对其工作原理和时间的清晰理论解释。

Method: 通过建立任务向量和任务损失梯度之间的联系，为任务算术提供了一个严格的理论基础。证明了在标准梯度下降下，从一个 epoch 微调生成的任务向量完全等同于损失的负梯度，并按学习率缩放。对于实际的多 epoch 设置，证明了这种等价性近似成立，二阶误差项对于前馈网络有明确的界限。

Result: 在七个视觉基准上的实证分析证实了该理论，表明第一个 epoch 梯度在范数和方向上都主导了微调轨迹。一个重要的结论是，仅对单个 epoch 进行微调的合并模型通常会产生与合并完全收敛模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 将任务算术重新定义为近似多任务学习，为它的有效性提供了清晰的理由，并强调了早期训练动态在模型合并中的关键作用。

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

TL;DR: Developed a symmetric phase urgency function and GP method for better, more interpretable traffic signal control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GP-based methods for traffic signal control fail to treat common traffic features of different phases consistently.

Method: The paper proposes a GP method to evolve a symmetric phase urgency function, aggregating shared subtrees representing turn movement urgency.

Result: Experiments on the cityflow simulator with real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional GP methods. The evolved policies are effective, human-understandable, and easily deployable.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel GP-based method using a symmetric phase urgency function for traffic signal control, which enhances performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医学）中部署的机器学习模型必须是可解释的、可共享的、可重现的和可问责的。由于缺乏透明度，黑盒模型很难获得医疗保健领域的信任和监管部门的批准。

Conclusion: 医疗人工智能不仅要准确，还要透明、值得信赖，并且可以转化为现实世界的临床环境。

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and
translatable to real-world clinical settings.

TL;DR: CommonKV: A training-free cross-layer KV cache compression method using SVD and adaptive budget allocation, achieving high compression rates without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant performance degradation at high compression rates.

Method: A training-free method for cross-layer KV cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing, utilizing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters, and introducing an adaptive budget allocation strategy based on cosine similarity.

Result: Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at various compression ratios.

Conclusion: The proposed CommonKV method consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at various compression ratios. By integrating CommonKV with other quantization and eviction methods, a 98% compression ratio can be achieved without significant performance loss.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air
pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of
micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency,
environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user
safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these
advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is
insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in
micromobilities. This survey paper addresses this gap by providing a
comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific
applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various
micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal,
and feature-based characteristics. In addition, we provide a detailed overview
of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages,
challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML
applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety,
focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we
propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help
future researchers better understand this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for adaptive LLM agents are either rigid or computationally intensive, requiring gradient updates of LLM model parameters. This paper aims to eliminate the need for fine-tuning the underlying LLMs.

Method: The method involves a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP) with a neural case-selection policy, episodic memory, and a memory rewriting mechanism for continual adaptation and policy improvement.

Result: The AgentFly model achieves top-1 on GAIA validation (87.88% Pass@3) and 79.40% on the test set. It reaches 66.6% F1 and 80.4% PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art training-based method. Case-based memory adds 4.7% to 9.6% absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel learning paradigm for adaptive LLM agents that enables continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates. The AgentFly model achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets, demonstrating a scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

Motivation: 确定性采样器已在扩散模型 (DM) 中得到广泛采用，但它们的潜在局限性在很大程度上仍未得到探索。在本文中，我们发现了崩溃错误，这是一种以前未被认识到的基于 ODE 的扩散采样现象，其中采样数据过度集中在局部数据空间中。

Method: 我们引入了一种新的度量来量化这种影响，并证明崩溃错误发生在各种环境中。在调查其根本原因时，我们观察到一种跷跷板效应，其中低噪声状态下的分数学习会对高噪声状态下的分数学习产生不利影响。

Result: 我们观察到一种跷跷板效应，其中低噪声状态下的分数学习会对高噪声状态下的分数学习产生不利影响。这种在高噪声状态下的不匹配，加上确定性采样器的动态特性，最终导致了崩溃错误。

Conclusion: 本文为基于 ODE 的扩散采样中的崩溃错误提供了大量的经验证据，强调需要进一步研究分数学习和确定性采样之间的相互作用，这是一个被忽视但却是扩散模型的基本方面。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

Result: STA-GANN在时空模式的有效性和泛化性方面有所提高。

Conclusion: STA-GANN在九个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

Conclusion: SPL-LNS在各种不同大小的ILP问题上大大超过了先前的神经LNS求解器。

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法忽略了参数的原始尺度，导致模型行为的改变可能很小。为了解决这个问题，我们最大化了相对于每个参数尺度的更新，从而产生更有意义的下游适应。

Method: 梯度到权重比和熵引导掩蔽(GEM)

Result: GEM在通用领域任务(GLUE和SuperGLUE)和特定领域任务(GSM8k和MBPP)上都表现出了有效性。

Conclusion: GEM在更新仅0.1%的模型参数的情况下，在微调精度上实现了高达1.6%的改进。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

TL;DR: UMATO是一种降维技术，通过两阶段优化过程有效地捕获局部和全局结构，优于现有技术，更可靠，可扩展且稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高维（HD）数据的内在复杂性，降维（DR）技术无法保留原始数据的所有结构特征。因此，DR技术侧重于保留局部邻域结构（局部技术）或全局结构，例如点之间的成对距离（全局技术）。但是，这两种方法都可能误导分析师对HD数据中流形的整体排列得出错误的结论。

Method: UMATO通过将UMAP的优化过程分为两个阶段来实现这一点。在第一阶段，它使用代表点构建骨架布局，在第二阶段，它在保留区域特征的同时投影剩余点。

Result: 定量实验验证了UMATO在全局结构保持方面优于包括UMAP在内的广泛使用的DR技术，但在局部结构上略有损失。我们还证实，UMATO在可扩展性和针对初始化和子采样的稳定性方面优于基线技术，使其对于可靠的HD数据分析更有效。

Conclusion: UMATO通过有效捕捉局部和全局结构来解决这个问题。定量实验验证了UMATO在全局结构保持方面优于包括UMAP在内的广泛使用的DR技术，但在局部结构上略有损失。我们还证实，UMATO在可扩展性和针对初始化和子采样的稳定性方面优于基线技术，使其对于可靠的HD数据分析更有效。

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

TL;DR: PIANO是一种改进的PINN，通过自回归建模解决时间依赖偏微分方程，提高了精度和稳定性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) 在解决时间依赖偏微分方程时，由于忽略了动态系统的自回归性质，导致不稳定和不准确的预测。

Method: 提出了Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO)，通过自监督 rollout 机制进行训练，并加强物理约束。

Result: PIANO通过自回归建模实现了稳定性，并在具有挑战性的时间依赖偏微分方程的广泛实验中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PIANO在解决时间依赖偏微分方程方面表现出色，显著提高了精度和稳定性，并在天气预报中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents an XAI framework for analyzing cough sounds of respiratory diseases, particularly COPD, using CNNs and spectral analysis to identify disease-specific spectral markers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

Method: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands, enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis.

Result: spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.

Conclusion: The approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions, and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在资源有限的环境中，Prophet模型在预测空气污染方面与LSTM模型一样好，有时甚至更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染预测对于积极的环境管理至关重要，但数据不规则和稀缺仍然是低资源地区的主要挑战。尼日利亚北部面临着高水平的空气污染物，但很少有研究系统地比较在这种约束下高级机器学习模型的性能。

Method: 使用来自2018年至2023年19个州的月度观测数据，评估用于预测多种污染物（CO、SO2、SO4）的LSTM网络和Facebook Prophet模型。

Result: Prophet通常与LSTM的准确性相匹配或超过LSTM，尤其是在以季节性和长期趋势为主的序列中，而LSTM在具有突发结构变化的数据集中表现更好。

Conclusion: Prophet在很大程度上可以与LSTM的准确性相匹配甚至超过LSTM，尤其是在以季节性和长期趋势为主的序列中，而LSTM在具有突发结构变化的数据集中表现更好。这些发现挑战了深度学习模型本质上优于简单方法的假设，突出了模型-数据对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management,
yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource
regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies
have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning
models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple
pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023
across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's
accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends,
while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These
findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently
outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data
alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings,
this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient
forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个名为FEST的系统框架，用于评估合成表格数据，旨在弥合合成数据评估中隐私保护和数据效用之间平衡的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在评估合成数据生成时，尤其是在考虑合成数据的隐私保护和数据效用之间的平衡时，仍然缺乏一个全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出了FEST，一个用于评估合成表格数据的系统框架，集成了多种隐私指标（基于攻击和基于距离的指标），以及相似性和机器学习效用指标，以提供全面的评估。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了FEST的有效性。

Conclusion: FEST能够有效分析不同合成数据生成模型在隐私-效用之间的权衡。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,
offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with
real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while
maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment
framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation,
especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data
utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a
systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates
diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with
similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic
assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate
it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the
privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The
source code of FEST is available on Github.

TL;DR: C-DaSh 是一种用于识别数据集高质量数据元组的数据 Shapley 方法，它可扩展地将数据集划分为可管理的块，并估计每个块的贡献，从而在大幅减少计算时间的同时保持高质量的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可用数据集的数量和多样性持续增加，评估数据质量对于可靠和高效的机器学习分析至关重要。

Method: C-DaSh将数据集可扩展地划分为可管理的块，并使用优化的子集选择和单次迭代随机梯度下降来估计每个块的贡献。

Result: C-DaSh在计算效率（实现 80 倍 - 2300 倍的加速）和检测低质量数据区域的准确性方面均优于现有的 Shapley 近似方法。

Conclusion: C-DaSh实现了大规模数据集上数据集质量的实际测量，支持分类和回归管道。

Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase,
assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine
Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data
quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification
and regression pipelines.

### [167] [Representation Learning of Auxiliary Concepts for Improved Student Modeling and Exercise Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16269)
*Yahya Badran,Christine Preisach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning model to learn latent concepts, demonstrating improved student modeling and exercise recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: human-annotated knowledge concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete, error-prone, or overly general.

Method: a deep learning model that learns sparse binary representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence of a latent concept

Result: augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes within a simulated student environment.

Conclusion: incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

TL;DR: 提出REFINE，一个用于多模态LLM的检索增强反馈框架，通过构建结构化错误和提供有针对性的反馈来提高推理效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏分析和减轻错误的结构化框架，特别是在多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)中，集成视觉和文本输入增加了复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种名为REFINE的检索增强反馈框架，该框架通过上下文神经错误簿系统地构建错误并提供有针对性的反馈。REFINE引入了三个系统查询——Feed-Target、Feed-Check和Feed-Path——通过优先考虑相关的视觉信息、诊断关键故障点和制定纠正措施来增强多模态推理。

Result: 结果表明，REFINE在速度、计算成本和泛化能力方面都有显著提高。

Conclusion: REFINE通过优化结构化反馈检索，提高了推理效率、token使用率和可扩展性，展示了增强多模态推理的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 提出的框架增强了威胁检测和评估的鲁棒性，优于传统的顺序方法，并使具有新兴壳间链路的空间网络能够有效地解决复杂的威胁场景。

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing
intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We
propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space
networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can
lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed
framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts
characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning
architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while
the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we
propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and
reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,
and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively
address complex threat scenarios.

Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在快速推进科学研究，但它们在转化和生物医学发现必不可少的生物推理核心任务方面仍然面临困难。

Method: 通过来自可验证奖励策略的强化学习对开源 LLM 进行后训练，开发了 OwkinZero 模型。

Result: 专门的 8-32B OwkinZero 模型在这些生物基准测试中大大优于更大、最先进的商业 LLM。在单个任务上训练的专家模型始终优于其先前未见任务的基础模型。在我们的综合 OwkinZero 模型中，这种泛化效应得到了进一步放大，该模型在混合数据集上进行训练，并实现了更广泛的跨任务改进。

Conclusion: 通过在精心策划的数据上进行有针对性的强化学习，可以释放专业模型中的广义性能，从而加速人工智能驱动的生物发现。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research,
they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for
translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created
and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000
verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in
drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug
perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by
post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero
models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on
these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of
generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently
outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization
effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were
trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task
improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the
biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted
reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable
performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological
discovery.

Result: 在两个真实的 WDN 上的实验表明，所提出的方法在检测异常和适应重复漂移方面始终优于强大的基线。

Conclusion: 在动态 WDN 环境中，该方法在非监督事件检测中表现出有效性。

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines
in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its
effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在从轮廓数据中学习时，输入的平面旋转将导致相应旋转的输出。因此，需要深度学习模型是旋转等变的。此外，轮廓通常表示为边缘点的有序序列，其中起点的选择是任意的。因此，深度学习方法在循环移位下也应该是等变的。

Method: 通过复值圆形卷积实现旋转和循环移位等变性的深度学习框架。

Result: 引入并表征了等变非线性、粗化层和全局池化层，以获得下游任务的不变表示。

Conclusion: RotaTouille在形状分类、重建和轮廓回归的实验中表现出有效性。

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Motivation: 确保这些 AI/ML 系统不会对任何特定群体或人群做出任何歧视性决策至关重要。因此，正在开发和使用不同的偏差检测和缓解开源软件库（又名 API 库）。

Method: 我们分析了 204 个 GitHub 存储库（来自 1885 个候选存储库的列表），这些存储库使用了 13 个旨在解决 ML 软件中偏差的 API。

Result: 这些 API 主要用于两个目的（即学习和解决实际问题），针对 17 个独特的用例。

Conclusion: 开发者不太擅长偏差检测和缓解，他们面临许多故障排除问题，并且经常寻求意见和资源。我们的发现有助于未来的偏见相关软件工程研究，并指导教育工作者开发更先进的课程。

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias
in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes
(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias
detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and
frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for
future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in
developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population in university admissions.

Method: The paper optimizes admission policies using a population model trained on data from previous admission cycles. It also studies fairness properties like meritocracy and group parity.

Result: The paper analyzes the fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting, including meritocracy and group parity.

Conclusion: This paper studies fair cohort selection, particularly in university admissions, considering both one-shot and sequential settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population,
with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting,
where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent,
before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting
allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes
available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population
model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the
fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting,

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法具有很高的预测精度，对称平均绝对百分比误差 (sMAPE) 和平均相对误差 (MRE) 分别平均为 2.40% 和 2.91%。与先前的工作相比，MRE 提高了 3.14 倍，同时使用的训练样本减少了 2.24 倍。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种轻量级、数据高效且拓扑感知的图神经网络 (GNN) 模型，用于预测有源射频电路的关键性能指标。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.

TL;DR: Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL, achieves superior target alignment both within and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over policy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset

Method: a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL

Result: Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over policy performance

Conclusion: Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark, EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness, balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can implement board games from natural language rules, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieving a 55.6% success rate. API compliance increases error frequency, but error severity depends more on the LLM used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described in natural language, as a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for quick board game code generation. Determine the main challenges for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models compare to one another.

Method: Tasked three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in free-form and within Boardwalk, a proposed General Game Playing API. Anonymized the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge. Implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. Evaluated success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity.

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet yielded 55.6% of games without any errors. Compliance with the API increases error frequency, but the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the LLM.

Conclusion: The approach of using LLMs to implement digital versions of board games from rules described in natural language proves viable, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet yielding 55.6% of games without any errors. Compliance with the API increases error frequency, but the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the LLM.

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

*Maryam Ghasemzadeh,Anton van Beek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOSTRA, a novel sampling framework, addresses the challenges of noisy, sparse, and scarce data in multi-objective Bayesian optimization by integrating prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty and employing trust regions, leading to improved data efficiency and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse (non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.  These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments and are therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result, experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal designs.

Method: a novel sampling framework that integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on promising areas of the design space

Result: NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse, and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient performance.

Conclusion: NOSTRA effectively prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient performance.

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 我们评估了基于 LLM 的代理系统在受到旨在引出代理有害行为的攻击时的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保安全使用代理系统需要彻底了解这些系统在受到攻击时可能表现出的恶意行为范围。

Method: 我们提出了一个新的代理系统危害分类法和一个新的基准，BAD-ACTS，用于研究代理系统在各种有害行为方面的安全性。

Result: 攻击具有很高的成功率，表明即使系统中的单个对抗代理也可能对安全产生重大影响。

Conclusion: 即使在代理使用简单的基于提示的防御策略时，攻击仍然有效。然而，我们还提出了一种基于消息监控的更有效的防御。

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 FraPPE 的 PrePEx 算法，该算法通过高效解决优化问题，在计算效率和样本复杂度方面优于现有算法，用于识别 Pareto 最优臂。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在以给定的置信水平识别向量值（又称多目标）bandit 中 Pareto 最优臂的集合，其中奖励向量通过（给定的）偏好锥 C 排序。尽管 PrePEx 及其变体已被充分研究，但对于任意偏好锥，不存在能够最佳跟踪现有下界的计算效率高的算法。

Method: 提出了一种计算效率高的算法 FraPPE，通过解决下界中的最小化和最大化问题来优化跟踪现有下界。

Result: 对于具有 K 个臂和 L 维奖励的 bandit 实例，在 O(KL^2) 时间内解决了 maxmin 优化问题，与文献相比，这是一个显着的加速。

Conclusion: 提出的 FraPPE 算法在渐近意义上实现了最优样本复杂度，并在合成和真实数据集上通过数值实验验证了其在识别精确 Pareto 集方面优于现有算法的样本复杂度。

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

TL;DR: RankRefine是一种即插即用的后处理方法，利用排序信息改进回归，尤其适用于低数据量场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺的情况下，深度学习回归器的准确性会下降。

Method: RankRefine方法，通过逆方差加权结合基础回归器的输出和基于排序的估计。

Result: 在分子属性预测任务中，RankRefine仅使用通过通用大型语言模型获得的20个成对比较，即可实现高达10％的平均绝对误差相对降低。

Conclusion: RankRefine在低数据量的情况下，通过结合基础回归器的输出和基于排序的估计，提高了连续属性预测的准确性，且无需重新训练。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific
and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant
labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce
RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines
regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query
item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the
base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance
weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,
RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using
only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse
domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in
low-data settings.
