However,\ntraditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes,\noften overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for\nlearning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing\nrole-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal\nperformance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively\nintegrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model. HGMN\nutilizes hypergraph construction techniques to model higher-order relationships\nand combines role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable\nmamba transformer mechanism. By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction\nmethods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the\nconnections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's\nrepresentational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution\nlayers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph\nstructures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we\nincorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature\npropagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly\nintroduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nHGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node\nclassification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods.

To address this\nquestion, we investigate two broad classes of BPE inference schemes that differ\nfrom BPE application during training: a) targeted deviation from merge-lists\nincluding random merge orders, and various corruptions of merge list involving\ndeletion/truncation, and b) non-targeted BPE inference algorithms that do not\ndepend on the merge list but focus on compressing the text either greedily or\nexactly. Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks like\naccuracy-based QA benchmarks, machine translation, and open-ended generation\nreveal that while targeted deviation from the merge lists exhibits significant\ndegradation in language model performance, the non-targeted merge-list-free\ninference algorithms result in minimal impact on downstream performance that is\noften much smaller than expected. These findings pave way for simpler and\npotentially more privacy-preserving tokenization schemes that do not\ncatastrophically compromise model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u5e76\u5217\u8868\u7684 BPE \u63a8\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5408\u5e76\u5217\u8868\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u5173\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6b64\u5408\u5e76\u5217\u8868\u7684 BPE \u63a8\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e0e BPE \u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4 BPE \u5e94\u7528\u7684 BPE \u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff1aa) \u76ee\u6807\u6027\u5730\u504f\u79bb\u5408\u5e76\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u968f\u673a\u5408\u5e76\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d89\u53ca\u5220\u9664/\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u5408\u5e76\u5217\u8868\u635f\u574f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca b) \u975e\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u7684 BPE \u63a8\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5408\u5e76\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6216\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u538b\u7f29\u6587\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u5730\u504f\u79bb\u5408\u5e76\u5217\u8868\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u663e\u7740\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u7684\u3001\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u5e76\u5217\u8868\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5c0f\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u7684\u8981\u5c0f\u5f97\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u7684\u3001\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u5e76\u5217\u8868\u7684 BPE \u63a8\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5c0f\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u7684\u8981\u5c0f\u5f97\u591a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u5177\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6848\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u4f1a\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5730\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and\nregion-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads,\nlimiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM\nwithout additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to\nextract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location\nuncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we\npropose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM,\nwhich takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate\npixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road\nnetwork level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian\nmixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of\nscenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering.

In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a\nreal-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object\ndetection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce\na lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared\nand task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between\ntasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the\nweights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This\navoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation\ntasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and\ntesting labels in lane line segmentation.

This \"semantic drift\" compromises data\nreproducibility and governance, and impairs the utility of services like\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL systems. To address this,\na novel framework is proposed for the automated extraction of fine-grained\nschema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. This method\nidentifies four key components: source schemas, source tables, transformation\nlogic, and aggregation operations, creating a standardized representation of\ndata transformations. For the rigorous evaluation of lineage quality, this\npaper introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE), a metric that\nassesses both structural correctness and semantic fidelity. A new benchmark is\nalso presented, comprising 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world\nindustrial scripts. Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from\n1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like\nGPT-4o and GPT-4.1.

However, ordinary diffusion\nmodels ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions,\nwhich are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new\nperspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into\nconstructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two\ndistributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be\nmutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers.\nThen, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial\nphase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local\ndenoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an\ninformation-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on\nconditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a\nreal-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures\nof diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small\nlocal neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are\nonly necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions.

Previous\nstudies often conflate genuine differences in model quality with bias or\nincorrectly assume that evaluations from LLMs and humans follow the same rating\ndistributions. In this work, we present a statistical framework that explicitly\nformalizes assumptions under which self-bias can be identified and estimated.\nOur method models the difference in the scoring distribution that\nLLM-as-a-judge assigns to its own completions compared to other models, while\naccounting for the underlying quality of the completions provided by an\nindependent, third-party judge (e.g., humans). Our method reliably isolates and\nquantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine\nperformance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical\nanalysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs)\nconsisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM\njudges.

Traditionally, this\nprocess depends on manually designed nonlinear transformations (e.g.,\npolynomial or exponential functions) and hand-tuned fusion weights to balance\ncompeting goals -- an approach that is labor-intensive and frequently\nsuboptimal in achieving Pareto efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel\nUnified Monotonic Ranking Ensemble (UMRE) framework to address the limitations\nof traditional methods in ensemble sorting. UMRE replaces handcrafted\ntransformations with Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks (UMNN), which\nlearn expressive, strictly monotonic functions through the integration of\npositive neural integrals.

This is an even more serious threat\nbecause 1) it is common for users to continue asking relevant follow-up\nquestions to clarify certain jailbroken details, and 2) it is also possible\nthat the initial round of jailbreaking causes the LLMs to respond to additional\nirrelevant questions consistently. As the first step (First draft done at June\n2024) in exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, we construct a Multi-Turn Jailbreak\nBenchmark (MTJ-Bench) for benchmarking this setting on a series of open- and\nclosed-source models and provide novel insights into this new safety threat.

In\nreal-world applications, a user's historical interactions often serve as the\nfoundation for solving a wide range of predictive tasks, such as churn\nprediction, recommendations, or lifetime value estimation. Using a\ntask-independent user representation that is effective across all such tasks\ncan reduce the need for task-specific feature engineering and model retraining,\nleading to more scalable and efficient machine learning pipelines. The goal of\nthe RecSys Challenge 2025 by Synerise was to develop such Universal Behavioral\nProfiles from logs of past user behavior, which included various types of\nevents such as product purchases, page views, and search queries. We propose a\nmethod that transforms the entire user interaction history into a single\nchronological sequence and trains a GRU-based autoencoder to reconstruct this\nsequence from a fixed-size vector. If the model can accurately reconstruct the\nsequence, the latent vector is expected to capture the key behavioral patterns.\nIn addition to this core model, we explored several alternative methods for\ngenerating user embeddings and combined them by concatenating their output\nvectors into a unified representation.

Utility Control for AI Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly\nresource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial\ncomputational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal\nperformance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a\nuseful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands\nextensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when\na single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements\nfor performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model\nversions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult\nto maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a\nnovel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify\ntheir performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from\ntraditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,\nNNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you\ncontrolled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables\nmodel owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a\nbaseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced\ncapabilities.

The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for\nmechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of\nindividual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as\nneural networks.\n  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively\nencode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM\ncoordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer\nfrequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,\nparadoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.\n  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal\nSequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.\nThe resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing\noutcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;\nand 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging\ntowards a steady state sequence embedding solution.

However, label errors, defined as missing labels,\nincorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the\nquality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes\nof training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for\ndetecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically\nvalidated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to\ncorrect such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open\nproblem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction\ncalled REC$\\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the\nframework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced\nmicrotasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each\ncandidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate\nambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nREC$\\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our\ncrowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a\nrate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original\nannotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark\nfor label error detection and correction.

Existing deep search works are\ngenerally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web.\nHowever, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can\nleverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an\nagent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning\n(RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data\nefficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we\npropose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with\nhierarchical RL.

While automated formalization\noffers a potential solution, it faces two major challenges: model hallucination\n(e.g., undefined predicates, symbol misuse, and version incompatibility) and\nthe semantic gap caused by ambiguous or missing premises in natural language\ndescriptions. To address these issues, we propose CRAMF, a Concept-driven\nRetrieval-Augmented Mathematical Formalization framework. CRAMF enhances\nLLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions of core\nmathematical concepts, providing contextual grounding during code generation.\nHowever, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in this setting is\nnon-trivial due to the lack of structured knowledge bases, the polymorphic\nnature of mathematical concepts, and the high precision required in formal\nretrieval. We introduce a framework for automatically constructing a\nconcept-definition knowledge base from Mathlib4, the standard mathematical\nlibrary for the Lean 4 theorem prover, indexing over 26,000 formal definitions\nand 1,000+ core mathematical concepts. To address conceptual polymorphism, we\npropose contextual query augmentation with domain- and application-level\nsignals. In addition, we design a dual-channel hybrid retrieval strategy with\nreranking to ensure accurate and relevant definition retrieval.

The model\nintegrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers,\nenabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently,\nstate-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable\nperformance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused\nexclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering,\nwe trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their\naccuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer\nmodel tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest\naccuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to\nother evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications.\nTo extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by\ncombining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using\nstructured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the\nimpact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on\nclassification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that\nSurformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while\nthe Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly\nmore inference time.

To bridge model\nheterogeneity across different devices, we introduce an adaptive layer-wise\nfeature alignment method, which ensures consistent representations for\ncollaboratively tuning a shared side network. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that Fed MobiLLM can maintain robust fine-tuning performance while\nachieving extremely low on-device memory, with at least 95.2% reduction in\ncomputation overhead, 93.2% reduction in communication costs and 5.1x faster\nconvergence compared to existing methods, validating its efficacy for practical\nLLM adaptation over heterogeneous mobile devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fed MobiLLM \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u8054\u90a6 LLM FT \u7684\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4fa7\u9762\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u6d88\u9664\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u534f\u540c\u5fae\u8c03 (FT) \u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u613f\u666f\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u4e25\u5cfb\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8054\u90a6 LLM FT \u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed9\u79fb\u52a8\u786c\u4ef6\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u534f\u8bae\u4f1a\u56e0\u901f\u5ea6\u8f83\u6162\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u800c\u505c\u6ede\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4fa7\u9762\u8c03\u6574\u8303\u4f8bFed MobiLLM\uff0c\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9884\u7f29\u653e\u4e3b\u5e72 LLM \u5bf9\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u6267\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4e0a\u4f20\u9009\u5b9a\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u4fa7\u9762\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5e76\u542f\u7528\u5f02\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u534f\u540c\u8c03\u6574\u5171\u4eab\u4fa7\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "Fed MobiLLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u81f3\u5c11 95.2%\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86 93.2%\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 5.1 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Fed MobiLLM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u81f3\u5c11 95.2%\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86 93.2%\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 5.1 \u500d\u3002"}}

While sparse attention\nmechanisms can reduce latency and memory usage, existing approaches suffer from\nsignificant accuracy degradation due to accumulated errors during\nlong-generation reasoning. These methods generally require either high token\nretention rates or expensive retraining. We introduce LessIsMore, a\ntraining-free sparse attention mechanism for reasoning tasks, which leverages\nglobal attention patterns rather than relying on traditional head-specific\nlocal optimizations.

The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by\nthe domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and\ncomplex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be\nmitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as\nexemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and\ncost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for\nautomated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However,\nthe optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance\nsmaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose\nARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach\nthat systematically explores and optimizes this generation process. ARCE\nemploys an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which\nwe term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa\nmodel prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive\nexperiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark\nAEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%.

Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates\ndiffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more\ncoverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the\ncross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within\nthe diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not\naligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal\nwhile the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,\nrecent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration\nto learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the\ntranslation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.\nTo address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns\nthe diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global\noptimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with\ndiffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation\nprocess with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning\nmanner.

These factors create asymmetric\npower relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture.\nThe paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism\nin ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce\nproblematic language ideologies.

However, no dedicated benchmarks currently exist for\nOLLMs, and prior benchmarks designed for other LLMs lack the ability to assess\nsafety performance under audio-visual joint inputs or cross-modal safety\nconsistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Omni-SafetyBench, the first\ncomprehensive parallel benchmark for OLLM safety evaluation, featuring 24\nmodality combinations and variations with 972 samples each, including dedicated\naudio-visual harm cases. Considering OLLMs' comprehension challenges with\ncomplex omni-modal inputs and the need for cross-modal consistency evaluation,\nwe propose tailored metrics: a Safety-score based on conditional Attack Success\nRate (C-ASR) and Refusal Rate (C-RR) to account for comprehension failures, and\na Cross-Modal Safety Consistency Score (CMSC-score) to measure consistency\nacross modalities. Evaluating 6 open-source and 4 closed-source OLLMs reveals\ncritical vulnerabilities: (1) no model excels in both overall safety and\nconsistency, with only 3 models achieving over 0.6 in both metrics and top\nperformer scoring around 0.8; (2) safety defenses weaken with complex inputs,\nespecially audio-visual joints; (3) severe weaknesses persist, with some models\nscoring as low as 0.14 on specific modalities. Our benchmark and metrics\nhighlight urgent needs for enhanced OLLM safety, providing a foundation for\nfuture improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Omni-SafetyBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30OLLM\u5728\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u8054\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Omni-SafetyBench\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eOLLM\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u542b24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08C-ASR\uff09\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\uff08C-RR\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff08CMSC-score\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5bf96\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u548c4\u4e2a\u95ed\u6e90OLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u8f93\u5165\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u589e\u5f3aOLLM\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We show that models pretrained on line\ndrawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data\nefficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces\nmore compressible representations, enabling better distillation into\nlightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers\nconsistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers,\nhighlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge.

However, their direct application to time\nseries forecasting remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the\ninherent heterogeneity of temporal patterns and the modality gap between\ncontinuous numerical signals and discrete language representations. In this\nwork, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting\nby modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment.\nSpecifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions\nmultivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling\nlocalized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the\nmodality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal\nfeatures with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of\ntime series into language-based models while eliminating the need for\nhandcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world\nbenchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all\ndatasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\\% over recent\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN\ninterpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs\n(PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed\nversus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed\nvowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the\nword. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results\nsuggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the\nstressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch\nand third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability\nto acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending\ntraditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u97f3\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528LRP\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u8bfb\u5143\u97f3\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u8bfb\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u97f3\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(CNN)\u4ece\u53cc\u97f3\u8282\u8bcd\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u97f3\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u9010\u5c42\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f20\u64ad(LRP)\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728held-out\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe92%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u53d7\u5230\u91cd\u8bfb\u97f3\u8282\u548c\u975e\u91cd\u8bfb\u97f3\u8282\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91cd\u8bfb\u5143\u97f3\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u53d7\u5230\u91cd\u8bfb\u5143\u97f3\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5171\u632f\u5cf0\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u5176\u97f3\u9ad8\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u5171\u632f\u5cf0\u4e5f\u6709\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u91cd\u97f3\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u97f3\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}
