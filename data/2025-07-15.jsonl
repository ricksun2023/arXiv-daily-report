As in previous years,\nwe leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of\nhuman-annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking\ntasks. We mostly repeated last year's design, to get another matching test set,\nbased on the larger, cleaner, less-biased v2 passage and document set, with\npassage ranking as primary and document ranking as a secondary task (using\nlabels inferred from passage). As we did last year, we sample from MS MARCO\nqueries that were completely held out, unused in corpus construction, unlike\nthe test queries in the first three years. This approach yields a more\ndifficult test with more headroom for improvement. Alongside the usual MS MARCO\n(human) queries from MS MARCO, this year we generated synthetic queries using a\nfine-tuned T5 model and using a GPT-4 prompt.\n  The new headline result this year is that runs using Large Language Model\n(LLM) prompting in some way outperformed runs that use the \"nnlm\" approach,\nwhich was the best approach in the previous four years. Since this is the last\nyear of the track, future iterations of prompt-based ranking can happen in\nother tracks. Human relevance assessments were applied to all query types, not\njust human MS MARCO queries. Evaluation using synthetic queries gave similar\nresults to human queries, with system ordering agreement of $\\tau=0.8487$.\nHowever, human effort was needed to select a subset of the synthetic queries\nthat were usable.

These models are typically trained with a softmax loss\nover the item catalog. However, in web-scale settings, the item catalog is\noften prohibitively large, making full softmax infeasible. A common solution is\nsampled softmax, which approximates the full softmax using a small number of\nsampled negatives.\n  One practical and widely adopted approach is to use in-batch negatives, where\nnegatives are drawn from items in the current mini-batch. However, this\nintroduces a bias: items that appear more frequently in the batch (i.e.,\npopular items) are penalized more heavily.\n  To mitigate this issue, a popular industry technique known as logQ correction\nadjusts the logits during training by subtracting the log-probability of an\nitem appearing in the batch. This correction is derived by analyzing the bias\nin the gradient and applying importance sampling, effectively twice, using the\nin-batch distribution as a proposal distribution. While this approach improves\nmodel quality, it does not fully eliminate the bias.\n  In this work, we revisit the derivation of logQ correction and show that it\noverlooks a subtle but important detail: the positive item in the denominator\nis not Monte Carlo-sampled - it is always present with probability 1. We\npropose a refined correction formula that accounts for this. Notably, our loss\nintroduces an interpretable sample weight that reflects the model's uncertainty\n- the probability of misclassification under the current parameters. We\nevaluate our method on both public and proprietary datasets, demonstrating\nconsistent improvements over the standard logQ correction."}

Recent studies have attempted to integrate them\nvia multimodal knowledge graphs (MKGs) to further enhance recommendation\nperformance. However, existing methods typically freeze the MKG structure\nduring training, which limits the full integration of structural information\nfrom heterogeneous graphs (e.g., KG and user-item interaction graph), and\nresults in sub-optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel framework, termed Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary\nInformation for Multimodal Recommendation (SLIF-MR), which leverages item\nrepresentations from previous training epoch as feedback signals to dynamically\noptimize the heterogeneous graph structures composed of KG, multimodal item\nfeature graph, and user-item interaction graph. Through this iterative fusion\nmechanism, both user and item representations are refined, thus improving the\nfinal recommendation performance. Specifically, based on the feedback item\nrepresentations, SLIF-MR constructs an item-item correlation graph, then\nintegrated into the establishment process of heterogeneous graphs as additional\nnew structural information in a self-loop manner. Consequently, the internal\nstructures of heterogeneous graphs are updated with the feedback item\nrepresentations during training. Moreover, a semantic consistency learning\nstrategy is proposed to align heterogeneous item representations across\nmodalities. The experimental results show that SLIF-MR significantly\noutperforms existing methods, particularly in terms of accuracy and robustness."}

Although existing methods attempt to employ\nvarious compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the\nparameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from\nmodel performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems,\nthis paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS,\nwhich adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item\nembedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication\nrather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud\nserver can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items.

Our experimental results show significant\naccuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries,\nparticularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses\nknowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and\nshows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively\nin scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based\ninputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams\nor diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials\nscience contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can\nbe useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields."}

For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,\n3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect\nanomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the\ngeneralization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes\nand to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D\ndetection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the\ninsufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This\npaper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,\nwhich decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the\ngeneralization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an\nanomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving\ntarget-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the\ngeneralization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize\ntwo augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named\nKITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k\npairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories\nas extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.\nAdditionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not\nused in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely\nfor evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm\nand the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be\nobtained at https://github.com/xxxx/xxx)."}

Most existing long-term\ntracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are\navailable to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,\nreal-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate\ncausally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in\nstreaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based\non past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes\nessential.

We begin by evaluating\nthe suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they\ncan serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.\nHowever, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design\nis still required.

Strategies developed for\ndebiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they\nincorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge\ninto awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of\ninformation contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and\ncontradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if\nprompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a\nset of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including\nimplicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. \"Could you be\nwrong\" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent\nmetacognitive reflection.

However, their deployment in safety-critical\nsettings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,\nand (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As\nclinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of\nits predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high\nconfidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting\nconfidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce\ncontext-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate\nresponses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive\naccuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically\nprioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy\nclinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically\nmotivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task\naccuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)\nperformance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice\nquestions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework\ntrained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot\ngeneralization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for\nscalable calibration without the associated computational costs.

To ensure the consistency of structural information and\ndetails in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,\nwhich enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP\nmodels in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware\nvision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world\ndatasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:\nhttps://github.com/ywxjm/DehazeSB."}

Yet, only few tackle the difficult task of directly generating fully\natomistic structures jointly with the underlying amino acid sequence. This is\nchallenging, for instance, because the model must reason over side chains that\nchange in length during generation. We introduce La-Proteina for atomistic\nprotein design based on a novel partially latent protein representation: coarse\nbackbone structure is modeled explicitly, while sequence and atomistic details\nare captured via per-residue latent variables of fixed dimensionality, thereby\neffectively side-stepping challenges of explicit side-chain representations.\nFlow matching in this partially latent space then models the joint distribution\nover sequences and full-atom structures. La-Proteina achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on multiple generation benchmarks, including all-atom\nco-designability, diversity, and structural validity, as confirmed through\ndetailed structural analyses and evaluations. Notably, La-Proteina also\nsurpasses previous models in atomistic motif scaffolding performance, unlocking\ncritical atomistic structure-conditioned protein design tasks. Moreover,\nLa-Proteina is able to generate co-designable proteins of up to 800 residues, a\nregime where most baselines collapse and fail to produce valid samples,\ndemonstrating La-Proteina's scalability and robustness."}

Through a\ncomprehensive examination of recent systems, we identify recurring\nanti-patterns across three key dimensions: Baseline Fairness, Evaluation Setup,\nand Metric Design. These anti-patterns are uniquely problematic for LLM\ninference due to its dual-phase nature combining distinct prefill and decode\noperations, its handling of highly heterogeneous workloads, and its strict\ntemporal requirements for interactive use. We demonstrate how common\nanti-patterns -- such as inadequate baseline comparisons that conflate\nengineering effort with algorithmic novelty, workload selections that fail to\nrepresent production scenarios, and metric normalizations that hide substantial\nperformance variability like generation stalls-lead to misleading conclusions.\nTo address these challenges, we provide a comprehensive checklist derived from\nour analysis, establishing a framework for recognizing and avoiding these\nanti-patterns in favor of robust LLM inference evaluation.

We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting\nconfidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce\ncontext-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate\nresponses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive\naccuracy.

By sourcing activations from \"deceptive\" prompts and\npatching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate\nvulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network\nsimulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we\ndemonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from\na 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We\npropose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation\nin multimodal settings, and scaling effects.

The vast majority of\nTD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single\naction-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa).

Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as\neither QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been\ninvestigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is\nadvantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether\nsuch approaches are theoretically sound in general.

In\nthis work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module in multimodal models.

Consequently, the\nperformance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the\nunimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)\nframework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality\nfusion module in the multimodal model.

Specifically, 1) the embeddings\nderived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the\noptimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective\nmechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image\nunderstanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle\nwhen addressing multi-instance feature matching problems.

These issues manifest differently in\nvision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing\nsolutions remain domain-specific. We propose \\textit{StaRFM}, a unified\nframework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information\npenalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to\nreduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence\nmisalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,\ncalibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks.

Despite its significance, progress in the field has been\nhindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,\nwhich is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.\nDue to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal\nimages has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of\nanomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of\ngeneralization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.\nFurthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly\nfocus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),\noverlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that\nare commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce\na benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and\nsystematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and\nbenchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach\nleveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the\nbest performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when\nencountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms\nin one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with\na Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a\nnew SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/DopamineLcy/BenchReAD."}

We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation\ndata and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex\nagricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference\ndata requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first\nnational-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering\n~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural\nland use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission\nerrors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union\n(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field\ndelineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture\nfragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global\nland cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural\nfrontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in\nMozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16\nha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial\nresolution (0.05{\\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of\naccessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation\nreflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder\nfarms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.\nOur results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to\nsocio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food\nproduction, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their\ntrade-offs."}

We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework\nthat combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.\nMoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter\nefficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by\ndynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This\nallows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still\nactive at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency\nby selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core\nmechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the\nfirst recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory\nfootprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms\na new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it\nsignificantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,\nwhile delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive\nbaselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards\nlarge-model quality without incurring large-model cost."}
