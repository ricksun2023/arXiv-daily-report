*Lance Calvin Lim Gamboa,Yue Feng,Mark Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本综述分析了将偏见评估和缓解方法扩展到多语言和非英语环境的新兴研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前训练的多语言模型表现出与处理英语文本的模型相同的社会偏见。

Method: 通过考察语言多样性、文化意识以及评估指标和缓解技术的选择来检查这些研究。

Result: 揭示了该领域主要方法设计选择中的差距（例如，对某些语言的偏好，多语言缓解实验的稀缺），同时编目了在跨语言和文化调整偏见基准时遇到的常见问题和实施的解决方案。

Conclusion: 为未来的研究指明了方向，这些研究可以加强多语言偏见文献的包容性、跨文化适当性以及与最先进的自然语言处理进展的结合。

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart
directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

### [2] [Prompting Strategies for Language Model-Based Item Generation in K-12 Education: Bridging the Gap Between Small and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20217)
*Mohammad Amini,Babak Ahmadi,Xiaomeng Xiong,Yilin Zhang,Christopher Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用语言模型自动生成多项选择题 (MCQ) 用于形态学评估，旨在降低手动测试开发的成本和不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在降低手动测试开发的成本和不一致性。

Method: 比较了微调后的中等模型 (Gemma, 2B) 与较大的未经调整的模型 (GPT-3.5, 175B)，并评估了七种结构化提示策略。

Result: 结构化提示，特别是结合了思维链和顺序设计的策略，显著提高了 Gemma 的输出。Gemma 通常比 GPT-3.5 的零样本响应产生更多符合结构和教学上适当的项目，提示设计在中型模型性能中起着关键作用。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和高效微调可以增强中型模型在有限数据条件下进行 AIG 的能力。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

### [4] [Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324)
*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO)方法，以解决小型语言模型在agentic RAG中由于推理能力差而导致的稀疏奖励和不稳定训练问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在agentic RAG中由于推理能力差，导致奖励稀疏和训练不稳定。

Method: 提出DGPO，通过从teacher demonstrations进行冷启动初始化，并在策略优化期间进行连续的teacher guidance来解决这些挑战。同时，引入Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC)这一细粒度指标来评估。

Result: DGPO使小型模型能够实现复杂的agentic搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至优于大型teacher模型。

Conclusion: DGPO使得在计算资源受限的环境中实现agentic RAG成为可能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [5] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)
*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GUARD, a testing method to check if LLMs comply with government ethics guidelines, by generating guideline-violating questions and jailbreak scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Governments are issuing ethics guidelines for LLMs, but it's hard to translate them into concrete tests.

Method: GUARD automatically generates guideline-violating questions and uses jailbreaks to provoke unethical responses. It then creates a compliance report.

Result: GUARD was tested on seven LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7) using government guidelines and jailbreak diagnostics. It can also transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models.

Conclusion: GUARD is effective in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [6] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为JERR的新框架，旨在通过基于图的推理来增强LLM的长期上下文理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长上下文时面临内存限制、无法处理复杂的长上下文任务以及缺乏透明度和容易产生幻觉等问题。

Method: 该方法包括三个关键组成部分：概要提取、图构建和关系推理。首先，通过战略性地分块文本来提取概要，然后构建有向无环图（DAG）以解决冗余并确保逻辑一致性，最后，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）来帮助模型导航复杂的推理路径。

Result: 实验结果表明，JERR在ROUGE和F1指标上始终优于所有基线，并在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分。

Conclusion: JERR框架提供了一种新颖的解决方案，使LLM能够以更高的可靠性和透明度处理扩展的上下文和复杂的推理任务。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

### [7] [Graph-R1: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with NP-Hard Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20373)
*Yuyao Wang,Bowen Liu,Jianheng Tang,Nuo Chen,Yuhan Li,Qifan Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的训练方法，利用NP-hard图问题来提升大型语言模型(LLM)的推理能力，尤其是在长链思考(Long CoT)方面。他们通过两阶段的后训练框架，包括有监督微调和强化学习，显著提高了模型在数学、编码等多个领域的泛化能力和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长链思考(Long CoT)训练依赖于高质量但昂贵的人工数据集。因此，本文旨在探索一种可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 该研究提出了一种两阶段后训练框架：(1) 在拒绝采样的NP-hard图实例上进行长链思考有监督微调(SFT)，以增强推理深度；(2) 通过细粒度奖励设计的强化学习(RL)，以提高推理效率。

Result: 提出的模型Graph-R1-7B在数学、编码、STEM和逻辑等领域表现出强大的泛化能力，并在NP-hard图问题上的准确性和推理效率方面超过了QwQ-32B。

Conclusion: NP-hard图问题可以作为一种有效且可扩展的资源，用于提升LLM中的长链思考推理能力，为LLM的后训练开辟了一个新的方向。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

### [8] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE)的框架，用于评估大型语言模型(LLM)在考虑对话历史情况下的行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的心理测试方法在评估LLM时采用context-free的方式，忽略了真实世界中对话历史对回答的影响。

Method: 本文构建了CAPE框架，并引入了新的指标来量化LLM回答的一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，对话历史可以通过上下文学习提高LLM回答的一致性，但也会导致个性转变。GPT模型对问题顺序不敏感，而Gemini-1.5-Flash和Llama-8B则表现出显著的敏感性。GPT模型的回应源于其内在的个性和先前的互动，而 Gemini-1.5-Flash 和 Llama--8B 则在很大程度上依赖于先前的互动。

Conclusion: 将CAPE框架应用于角色扮演代理(RPA)表明，依赖于上下文的个性转变可以提高响应的一致性，并且更好地与人类判断保持一致。

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [9] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM中推理步骤的效用如何影响最终答案的正确性，发现条件熵降低与正确答案相关，而平坦或增加的熵通常导致错误答案，且错误的推理路径往往比正确的长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究推理效用对最终答案正确性的贡献，以及解决生成更多上下文并不保证答案信心的增加的问题。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成MATH数据集的推理链，并使用Qwen3-8B量化这些链对最终准确性的效用。通过条件熵测量模型在每个推理步骤中答案范围Y上的不确定性。

Result: 条件熵降低与正确答案密切相关，而平坦或增加的熵通常导致错误答案。错误的推理路径往往比正确的长，表明更长的推理不一定产生更好的结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计高效的推理管道提供了基础，该管道可以及早发现并避免无益的推理。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

### [11] [DentalBench: Benchmarking and Advancing LLMs Capability for Bilingual Dentistry Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20416)
*Hengchuan Zhu,Yihuan Xu,Yichen Li,Zijie Meng,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DentalBench is introduced to evaluate LLMs in the dental field, revealing performance gaps and the importance of domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs lack evaluation in specialized medical fields like dentistry due to the absence of targeted resources.

Method: DentalBench includes DentalQA (question-answering benchmark) and DentalCorpus (large-scale corpus) for evaluating and adapting LLMs.

Result: Evaluation of 14 LLMs shows performance gaps; domain adaptation improves performance, especially on knowledge-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: Domain-specific benchmarks are crucial for developing reliable LLMs for healthcare.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-CQR: A novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input queries using a corpus-centric KG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs) offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, unlike existing methods that primarily address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts.

Method: KG-CQR comprises subgraph extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes without additional training.

Result: achieving a 4-6% improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval effectiveness

Conclusion: KG-CQR's superior performance on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6% improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline models.

*Feng Zhang,Chengjie Pang,Yuehan Zhang,Chenyu Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门为民用航空维护设计的工业级基准，以评估大型语言模型（LLM）在该领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏专门的评估工具来衡量LLM在民用航空维护领域的知识和推理能力。

Method: 开发了一个新的基准，用于评估LLM在民用航空维护场景中的能力，并利用该基准评估现有的向量嵌入模型和LLM。

Result: 通过实验证明了该基准在评估模型性能方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该基准可以识别LLM在该领域的不足，为有针对性的改进工作奠定基础，并促进民用航空维护领域更智能解决方案的进步。

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and
development:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更有效地搜索和匹配实用的工作标题。

Method: 该系统采用TF-IDF进行文本向量化，并使用余弦相似度计算相似度值。系统支持标题和关键词搜索。

Result: 在包含705个实用工作标题的测试中，该系统在两阶段测试中表现良好，即使在随机标题的情况下也能找到相同数量的标题，并保持较高的平均匹配得分。

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效地搜索实用的工作标题，并提供较高的匹配准确率。

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

TL;DR: MCP-Bench是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在真实、多步骤任务中tool use能力，跨工具协调能力，精确的参数控制能力和规划/推理能力的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的API基准测试无法充分评估大型语言模型在tool use，跨工具协调能力，精确的参数控制能力和规划/推理能力，因为它们依赖于显式的工具规范，浅层的few-step工作流程和孤立的领域操作。

Method: MCP-Bench建立在模型上下文协议（MCP）之上，将LLM连接到28个代表性的实时MCP服务器，这些服务器跨越金融、旅游、科学计算和学术搜索等领域，包含250个工具。每个MCP服务器提供一组协同工作的互补工具，从而能够构建具有丰富输入输出耦合的真实多步骤任务。

Result: 在20个先进的LLM上进行的实验表明，在MCP-Bench中仍然存在挑战。

Conclusion: MCP-Bench是一个有用的基准，可以用来评估大型语言模型在tool use能力，跨工具协调能力，精确的参数控制能力和规划/推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.
Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code

### [16] [Prediction of mortality and resource utilization in critical care: a deep learning approach using multimodal electronic health records with natural language processing techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20460)
*Yucheng Ruan,Xiang Lan,Daniel J. Tan,Hairil Rizal Abdullah,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的深度学习框架，该框架集成了多模态电子健康记录（EHR），以预测重症监护病房（ICU）中的死亡率和资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要集中于结构化的EHR，忽略了自由文本笔记中的有价值的临床见解。此外，结构化数据中的文本信息的潜力尚未得到充分利用。这项研究旨在介绍和评估一种使用自然语言处理技术的深度学习框架，该框架集成了多模态EHR，以预测危重护理环境中的死亡率和资源利用率。

Method: 该研究利用两个真实世界的EHR数据集，开发并评估了我们的模型在三个临床任务上的表现，并与现有的领先方法进行了比较。我们还对框架中的三个关键组件进行了消融研究：医疗提示、自由文本和预训练的句子编码器。此外，我们还评估了模型对结构化EHR中损坏的鲁棒性。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的三个临床任务的实验表明，与最佳现有方法相比，我们提出的模型在死亡率预测的BACC/AUROC上提高了1.6%/0.8%，在LOS预测的RMSE/MAE上提高了0.5%/2.2%，在手术持续时间估计的RMSE/MAE上提高了10.9%/11.0%。与其他基线相比，它在不同损坏率的三个任务中始终表现出卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架是一种有效且准确的深度学习方法，用于预测危重护理中的死亡率和资源利用率。该研究还强调了使用带有Transformer编码器的提示学习在分析多模态EHR中的成功。重要的是，该模型对结构化数据中的数据损坏表现出很强的弹性，尤其是在高损坏级别下。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 阴谋论会侵蚀公众对科学和机构的信任，并且会通过不断发展和吸收反证据来抵制反驳。ConspirED 是一个阴谋内容数据集，它使用 CONSPIR 认知框架对来自在线阴谋文章的多句摘录（80-120 个单词）中的阴谋思想的认知特征进行注释。该数据集用于开发识别阴谋特征并确定文本摘录中主要特征的计算模型，并评估大型语言/推理模型 (LLM/LRM) 对阴谋输入的鲁棒性。研究发现，两者都因阴谋内容而错位，产生反映输入推理模式的输出，即使在成功转移可比较的事实核查错误信息时也是如此。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能生成的错误信息变得越来越复杂，理解阴谋内容的修辞模式对于开发有针对性的预先揭穿和评估人工智能漏洞等干预措施非常重要。

Method: 引入 ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset)，它使用 CONSPIR 认知框架对来自在线阴谋文章的多句摘录（80-120 个单词）中的阴谋思想的认知特征进行注释。

Result: ConspirED 是第一个针对一般认知特征进行注释的阴谋内容数据集。我们发现，两者都因阴谋内容而错位，产生反映输入推理模式的输出，即使在成功转移可比较的事实核查错误信息时也是如此。

Conclusion: 计算模型和大型语言模型/推理模型 (LLM/LRM) 都会受到阴谋内容的影响，产生与输入推理模式相似的输出。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

TL;DR: FLORES+ benchmark存在缺陷，不适合真正的多语言评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现FLORES+基准测试在多语言评估适用性方面存在严重缺陷。

Method: 人工评估翻译质量，并使用简单启发式方法评估BLEU分数。

Result: 许多翻译未达到声称的90%质量标准，源句领域特定且文化偏向英语世界。复制命名实体可产生重要的BLEU分数。在高质量自然数据上训练的MT模型在FLORES+上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 多语言MT基准测试应使用领域通用和文化中立的源文本，减少对命名实体的依赖，以更好地反映现实世界的翻译挑战。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciTopic is a topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve scientific topic identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topic discovery methods lack a comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with complex, high-dimensional text relationships.

Method: Build a textual encoder, construct a space optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks guided by LLMs, and fine-tune the textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the contrastive loss of the triplets

Result: SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic discovery methods.

Conclusion: SciTopic enables researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的基于生成模型的查询驱动文本摘要框架，用于解决工业网络搜索中的实时 QDTS 问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抽取式摘要模型存在多阶段流水线导致信息损失和架构瓶颈，以及缺乏对用户查询和文档的语义理解的问题。

Method: 该方法集成了大模型蒸馏、监督微调、直接偏好优化和前瞻解码，将一个轻量级模型转换为领域专业的 QDTS 专家。

Result: 该模型在多个行业相关指标上优于生产基线，并达到了新的技术水平。同时，它还展示了出色的部署效率。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将生成模型应用于工业网络搜索中的实时 QDTS，并在性能和效率方面都取得了显著的成果。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型的全局距离感知建模方法（GDLLM），用于事件时间关系抽取（ETRE），以解决小语言模型处理不平衡分类数据集中的少数类关系能力有限以及大型语言模型人工设计的提示或指令可能引入额外噪声的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明语言模型对事件时间关系抽取很重要，但小语言模型的预训练知识有限，无法处理不平衡分类数据集中的少数类关系。大型语言模型的人工提示会引入噪声，干扰模型对事件间长距离依赖关系的判断。

Method: 提出了一种全局距离感知建模方法（GDLLM），利用图注意力网络构建距离感知图结构，辅助大型语言模型捕获长距离依赖特征。设计了一种基于软推理的时间特征学习范式，通过将大型语言模型生成的概率信息补充到多头注意力机制中，增强对短距离邻近关系识别。

Result: 在TB-Dense和MATRES两个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效地提高了少数关系类的性能，并提高了整体学习能力。

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习研究主要关注标签多样性，忽略了自然语言处理中至关重要的语言领域多样性，导致在实际非独立同分布数据环境下的性能下降。

Method: 提出了一个包含多样化数据的统一基准框架，并设计了一个自适应联邦蒸馏（AdaFD）框架，以应对同构和异构环境下的多域非独立同分布挑战。

Result: 实验结果表明，AdaFD 模型能够捕捉本地客户端的多样性，并取得比现有方法更好的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基准框架和AdaFD框架能够有效应对多域非独立同分布场景下的联邦学习挑战，并在实际应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)存在幻觉和知识过时等局限性，检索增强生成(RAG)是一种有效的解决方案。然而，由于资源有限和缺乏自然语言处理(NLP)专业知识，在中小企业(sme)中部署基于rag的工具仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 介绍EASI-RAG，一种结构化的敏捷方法，旨在促进RAG系统在工业中小企业环境中的部署。EASI-RAG基于方法工程原理，包含明确的角色、活动和技术。

Result: 通过在环境测试实验室的真实案例研究验证了该方法，在该案例中，实施了一个RAG工具，使用从操作程序中提取的数据来回答操作员的查询。该系统由一个没有RAG经验的团队在一个月内完成部署，并根据用户反馈进行了迭代改进。结果表明，EASI-RAG支持快速实施、高用户采用率，提供准确的答案，并提高底层数据的可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了RAG在工业中小企业中部署的潜力。未来的工作包括在不同的用例中进行推广，并进一步与微调模型集成。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为知识组合抽样 (KCS) 的新框架，旨在通过在给定上下文中抽样不同的知识组合来扩展生成的多跳问题的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究侧重于通过内容规划和不同的表达来多样化问题生成，但是这些方法通常强调生成简单的问题，而忽略了整合重要的知识，例如文档中的相关句子。为了解决数据稀疏性问题，提高语言模型学习的 Spurious patterns。

Method: KCS 将知识组合选择建模为句子级条件预测任务，并利用概率对比损失来预测下一个最相关的知识。

Result: 与竞争基线相比，KCS 将知识组合选择的整体准确性提高了 3.9%，并且其在数据增强方面的应用在 HotpotQA 和 2WikiMultihopQA 数据集上产生了改进。

Conclusion: KCS 框架有效地提高了知识组合选择的准确性和多样性，并在 HotpotQA 和 2WikiMultihopQA 数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

<details>

Motivation: 为了弥补评估的空白。

Method: 设计了CLEGR基准，以评估各种复杂程度的多模态推理。该基准采用合成图生成管道，并结合需要对结构和文本语义进行联合推理的问题。

Result: 软提示LLM基线与包含完整GNN主干的GLM性能相当。GLM在需要结构推理的任务中表现出明显的性能下降。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了当前GLM在图推理能力方面的局限性，并为推动社区朝着涉及图结构和语言的显式多模态推理发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

Motivation: 现有的NEC模型主要依赖于音标级别的编辑距离算法，在错误转录的词与ground-truth实体形式差异显著时，这些方法通常无法定位假设中的错误转录词。

Method: 利用语音特征检索候选实体，并设计一种生成方法来注释ASR转录中的实体错误。

Result: 在开源和自建测试集上进行了测试，结果表明该NEC方法可以显著提高实体准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在词形差异场景中有效，并将开源自建的测试集和训练数据。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出首个多语言多标签隐式篇章关系识别 (IDRR) 模型 HArch，在 DiscoGeM 2.0 语料库上评估，利用篇章意义之间的层级依赖性来预测 PDTB 3.0 框架中所有三个意义层级的概率分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IDRR 任务需要一个多语言多标签分类模型。

Method: 提出 HArch 模型，利用篇章意义之间的层级依赖性。

Result: RoBERTa-HArch 在英语上表现最佳，而 XLM-RoBERTa-HArch 在多语言设置中表现最佳。微调模型优于 GPT-4o 和 Llama-4-Maverick。在 DiscoGeM 1.0 上报告了 SOTA 结果。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了针对特定任务进行微调优于提示学习，并验证了层级方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

*Ruiyi Yan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重点关注隐写术和水印中Alice和Bob之间的分词不一致性(TI)，其中TI会削弱鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型显著提高了文本生成的能力和效率。一方面，它们提高了基于文本的隐写术的质量。另一方面，它们也强调了水印作为防止恶意滥用的保障措施的重要性。

Method: 基于问题token的两个关键特征：低频和临时性，我们为TI消除提出了两种定制的解决方案：一种用于隐写术的逐步验证方法和一种用于水印的后验回滚方法。

Result: 与隐写术中的传统消除歧义方法相比，直接解决TI可以提高流畅性、不可感知性和反隐写分析能力；对于水印，解决TI可以提高可检测性和抵抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文着重于解决隐写术和水印技术中分词不一致的问题，并提出了两种定制的解决方案，实验结果表明，该方案在提高隐写术的流畅性、不可感知性和反隐写分析能力以及水印的可检测性和抵抗攻击的鲁棒性方面均有显著效果。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

TL;DR: rStar2-Agent是一个14B的数学推理模型，通过agentic强化学习训练，达到了前沿水平的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该模型展示了先进的认知行为，例如在使用Python编码工具前仔细思考，并反思代码执行反馈，以自主探索、验证和完善复杂问题解决中的中间步骤。

Method: 该模型通过三个关键创新实现：高效的RL基础设施、GRPO-RoC算法和高效的agent训练方法。

Result: rStar2-Agent在AIME24和AIME25上分别实现了80.6%和69.8%的平均pass@1分数，超过了DeepSeek-R1（671B）。

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent-14B在数学、对齐、科学推理和agentic工具使用任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

### [32] [Leveraging Semantic Triples for Private Document Generation with Local Differential Privacy Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20736)
*Stephen Meisenbacher,Maulik Chevli,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的方法 DP-ST，它利用语义三元组在本地 DP 保证下生成邻域感知的私有文档。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自然语言处理中的差分隐私 (DP) 方法通常需要很高的隐私参数 ε 才能合理地对文本进行私有化，因为它们需要在很强的局部 DP 保证下使输入文本与任何其他潜在文本无法区分。

Method: 该方法利用语义三元组进行邻域感知的私有文档生成，并结合 LLM 后处理以提高文本连贯性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在限制 DP 范围到私有化邻域时，能够有效地平衡隐私和效用，即使在较低的 ε 值下也能生成连贯的文本。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了连贯性在以合理的 ε 水平实现平衡的私有化输出方面的重要性。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的隐式仇恨言论检测方法，该方法通过微调基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的通用嵌入模型来实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式仇恨言论难以检测，因为它不包含明确的贬义或煽动性词语。

Method: 该方法通过微调基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的通用嵌入模型，例如 Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed 和 E5。

Result: 在多个 IHS 数据集上的实验表明，在数据集内评估中，F1-macro 分数提高了 1.10 个百分点，在跨数据集评估中，F1-macro 分数提高了 20.35 个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过简单地微调通用嵌入模型，就可以在隐式仇恨言论检测方面取得最先进的性能。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自适应解码方法 GUARD，通过结合全局和局部不确定性信号，有效地平衡了 LLM 输出中的连贯性和多样性，同时提高了生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比搜索解码策略在平衡连贯性和多样性方面存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的“Glocal”不确定性驱动框架，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差来整合长期和短期不确定性信号，并引入基于 token 计数的惩罚来降低计算开销。

Result: 实验结果表明，GUARD 在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得了良好的平衡，并显着提高了生成速度。在不同文本质量维度上，人工和 LLM 评估器都验证了其卓越的性能。

Conclusion: GUARD 是一种有效的自适应解码方法，能够在保证文本质量的前提下，提高生成速度和平衡连贯性和多样性。

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at
https://github.com/YecanLee/GUARD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型生成的合成治疗对话越来越多地用于心理健康自然语言处理，以模拟咨询场景、训练模型和补充有限的真实数据。但是，这些合成对话是否能捕捉到真实治疗的情感动态仍然不清楚。我们对真实和LLM生成的认知行为疗法对话之间的情感弧进行了首次比较分析。结果表明，虽然合成对话流畅且结构连贯，但它们在关键的情感属性上与真实的对话不同：真实的对话表现出更大的情感变异性、更富有情感的语言以及更真实的反应和调节模式。此外，真实和合成说话者之间的情感弧相似性较低，尤其是对于客户。我们引入了RealCBT，这是一个真实的CBT会话数据集，以支持未来在该领域的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型生成的合成治疗对话是否能捕捉到真实治疗的情感动态，并弥补真实数据的不足。

Method: 调整Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架，分析效价、唤醒和支配维度上的细粒度情感轨迹。分析跨越完整对话和个人说话者角色（咨询师和客户），使用从公共视频转录的真实会话和来自CACTUS数据集的合成对话。

Result: 合成对话虽然流畅且结构连贯，但与真实对话在关键情感属性上存在差异：真实会话表现出更大的情感变异性、更富有情感的语言以及更真实的反应和调节模式。真实和合成说话者之间的情感弧相似性较低，尤其是对于客户。

Conclusion: 目前LLM生成的治疗数据存在局限性，强调了情感保真度在心理健康应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

*Harethah Abu Shairah,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,George Turkiyyah,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI) 的白盒方法，通过永久性地将模型的激活导向拒绝介导子空间来增强模型的安全性对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 中的安全对齐通常涉及调节内部表示以拒绝有害请求。最近的研究表明，这些安全机制可以通过消融或移除模型中特定的表示方向来绕过。

Method: ROSI 是一种简单的、无需微调的秩一权重修改方法，应用于所有残差流写入矩阵。所需的安全性方向可以从一小组有害和无害的指令对中计算出来。

Result: ROSI 能够持续提高安全拒绝率（由 Llama Guard 3 评估），同时保持模型在 MMLU、HellaSwag 和 Arc 等标准基准测试中的效用。ROSI 还可以通过放大“未审查”模型自身的潜在安全方向来重新对齐它们。

Conclusion: 有针对性的、可解释的权重引导是一种廉价而有效的机制，可以提高 LLM 的安全性，补充了资源密集型微调范式。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Motivation: 青少年心理健康问题日益严重，促使人们关注自动检测数字文本中心理困扰早期迹象的方法。认知扭曲是加剧心理困扰的非理性思维模式，及早发现可能有助于及时进行低成本干预。

Method: 分析荷兰青少年撰写的论坛帖子，研究认知扭曲检测的跨语言和跨语域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 领域自适应方法在跨语言和跨语域的认知扭曲检测中具有潜力，为及早发现青少年心理困扰提供了可能。

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个可扩展的框架，用于构建评估基准，以挑战 RAG 系统整合跨不同来源的信息并生成长篇回复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的许多应用程序需要整合和总结分散在多个来源的信息，而没有一个来源足以回答用户的问题。

Method: 我们提出了一个可扩展的框架，用于构建评估基准。

Result: 我们使用该框架在多源检索和合成方面构建了两个新的基准：MSRS-Story 和 MSRS-Meet，分别代表叙事合成和摘要任务，需要从大型集合中检索。

Conclusion: 生成质量高度依赖于检索效果，检索效果因任务而异。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量化对多语言任务的影响，尤其是在资源受限的硬件上部署大型语言模型时。

Method: 使用五种大型语言模型（1.7B到70B参数）在55种语言上进行大规模的训练后量化（PTQ）评估。

Result: 4-bit量化通常能保持高资源语言和大型模型的翻译质量，但低资源和类型多样的语言在2-bit设置下会显著降低质量。GGUF变体即使在2-bit精度下也能提供最稳定的性能。语言匹配的校准主要在低比特场景中提供益处。

Conclusion: 为在量化约束下部署用于机器翻译的多语言LLM提供了可操作的见解，尤其是在低资源环境中。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语音到语音（S2S）大型语言模型（LLM）仍然是一个根本性的挑战。

Method: 提出了SageLM，它联合评估语义和声学维度，并利用基于理由的监督来增强可解释性并指导模型学习。引入了SpeechFeedback，一个合成偏好数据集，并采用两阶段训练范式来缓解语音偏好数据的稀缺性。

Result: SageLM与人类评估者的协议率为82.79％，优于级联和基于SLM的基线至少7.42％和26.20％。

Conclusion: SageLM在S2S LLM评估方面表现出色。

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

TL;DR: 本研究着眼于大型语言模型（LLM）在动态环境中使用工具时，在多轮对话中面临的推理一致性、策略遵守和信息提取等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理和规划方面的最新进展使其有潜力成为能够在动态环境中使用工具的自主代理，但在多轮对话环境中，这些代理通常难以保持一致的推理，遵守特定领域的策略，并在长时间的工具调用和对话中提取正确的信息。

Method: 对对话轨迹中出现的常见错误进行了全面的手动分析，并尝试了对工具调用代理的输入进行重新构建，以改进代理的决策。提出了输入重构多代理（IRMA）框架，该框架自动重构用户查询，并结合相关的领域规则和工具建议，使工具调用代理能够专注于任务。

Result: IRMA在整体pass@5得分方面显著优于ReAct、Function Calling和Self-Reflection，分别高出16.1%、12.7%和19.1%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在动态环境中，IRMA相比其他方法具有更优越的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus

*Jiaqian Li,Qisheng Hu,Jing Li,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的两阶段示例选择策略，用于提高上下文学习（ICL）在结构化预测任务中的性能，特别是在语义解析方面。该方法通过结构感知监督微调BERT检索器，并使用插件模块增强句法信息，从而在效率、泛化性和性能之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ICL示例选择策略在结构化预测任务中忽略了结构对齐，导致性能欠佳和泛化能力差。

Method: 该方法包括两个阶段：首先，使用结构感知监督微调BERT检索器，使其能够选择语义相关且结构对齐的示例；然后，使用插件模块增强检索器，该模块可以放大隐藏表示中的句法信息。

Result: 在三个语义解析任务的四个基准测试中，该方法始终优于现有的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地提高ICL在结构化预测任务中的性能，并且具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

TL;DR: ProactiveEval: A unified framework for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works focus on domain-specific scenarios, leading to fragmented evaluations and limited exploration of proactive conversation abilities.

Method: ProactiveEval decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue guidance, establishing evaluation metrics and enabling automatic generation of diverse evaluation data.

Result: Experiments with 22 LLMs show DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet excel in target planning and dialogue guidance, respectively.

Conclusion: Reasoning capabilities influence proactive behaviors, with implications for future model development.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LETHE的新方法，通过知识稀释来消除大型语言模型（LLM）中的后门行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后门防御方法不够全面，无法抵御基于模型编辑、多触发和无触发攻击等高级场景。

Method: LETHE利用内部和外部机制，通过知识稀释来消除LLM中的后门行为。内部，LETHE利用轻量级数据集训练一个干净的模型，然后将其与后门模型合并，以中和恶意行为。外部，LETHE将良性和语义相关的证据纳入提示，以转移LLM对后门特征的注意力。

Result: 在5个广泛使用的LLM上的分类和生成领域中的实验结果表明，LETHE优于8个最先进的防御基线，对抗8个后门攻击。LETHE将高级后门攻击的攻击成功率降低了高达98%，同时保持了模型的效用。

Conclusion: LETHE已被证明具有成本效益，并且对自适应后门攻击具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用capsules中动态路由进行句子关系抽取的方法，并在常用数据集上取得了state-of-the-art的结果。同时，探讨了模型在不同数据集上的表现差异，认为Wikidata标签中的噪声和re-representation是影响性能的因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决自然语言处理中句子关系抽取的问题。

Method: 使用capsules中的动态路由进行句子关系抽取。

Result: 在Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, 和 Conll04等数据集上超过了现有技术水平，但在Wikidata数据集上表现不佳。发现标签噪声是影响性能的原因之一，并表明该模型可以比普通模型更好地进行re-representation。

Conclusion: 标签噪声和re-representation是句子关系抽取中的挑战。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合大型语言模型（LLM）和符号求解器来计算税务义务的方法，旨在提高税务计算的准确性和可审计性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国国税局的数据显示，美国人平均花费270美元和13个小时来报税，且报税过程复杂，容易出错，导致高额罚款。现代大型语言模型（LLM）难以胜任这项任务。

Method: 该方法集成了LLM与符号求解器，并结合了将纯文本规则预先翻译成形式逻辑程序，以及智能检索的形式案例表示。

Result: 在StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA)数据集上的评估表明，该系统能够显著提高性能，并将成本降低到远低于实际平均水平。

Conclusion: 神经符号架构有希望提高获得可靠税务帮助的公平性，且在经济上是可行的。

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CHAIR-DPO的方法，用于减少多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM容易产生幻觉，即生成的内容在视觉输入中没有反映。解决幻觉问题是使MLLM生成更可靠内容的关键。

Method: 利用CHAIR指标区分生成答案的优劣，并使用直接偏好优化(DPO)对MLLM进行微调。

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉基准测试中有效减少了幻觉答案的数量。

Conclusion: 基于CHAIR的奖励对MLLM进行微调可以有效减少幻觉。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像伪造定位框架，该框架集成了图像生成和Stable Diffusion (SD) 的强大感知能力，以实现更高效和准确的伪造定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像伪造定位方法严重依赖于劳动密集且成本高昂的标注数据，难以跟上新兴图像处理技术的步伐。

Method: 1. 理论上证明了SD的多模态架构可以基于伪造相关信息进行调节，从而使模型能够固有地输出伪造定位结果。2. 利用Stable DiffusionV3 (SD3)的多模态框架，通过将图像伪造残差（使用特定的高通滤波器提取的高频信号）视为一种显式模态，在潜在空间中融合，以增强伪造定位性能。3. 该方法完全保留了SD3提取的潜在特征，从而保留了输入图像的丰富语义信息。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上，该框架的性能比当前最先进的图像伪造定位模型提高了12%。

Conclusion: 该模型在涉及真实文档伪造图像和自然场景伪造图像的取证任务中表现出强大的性能，即使在训练期间完全没有见过这些数据。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前人工智能模型在诊断皮肤疾病方面取得了显著成功，但其预测的可解释性有待提高。

Method: 通过微调，将MLLM嵌入空间与病变外观相关的定量属性（如病变面积）相关联，从而实现模型预测的可解释性。

Result: 研究表明，MLLM嵌入空间可以通过这种方式与定量属性相关联。

Conclusion: 该研究为提高皮肤癌诊断模型的可解释性提供了一种新的途径。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的 Vision Transformer (ViT) 框架，用于自动调制识别 (AMR)，该框架集成了监督、自监督和重构目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 AMR 解决方案通常依赖于大型标记数据集或多阶段训练流程，这限制了实践中的可扩展性和泛化性。

Method: 该模型结合了 ViT 编码器、轻量级卷积解码器和线性分类器；重构分支将增强信号映射回其原始信号，将编码器锚定到细粒度的 I/Q 结构。

Result: 在 RML2018.01A 数据集上，该方法在低标签情况下优于有监督的 CNN 和 ViT 基线，仅使用 15-20% 的标记数据即可达到 ResNet 级别的准确率，并在不同的 SNR 水平下保持强大的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为 AMR 提供了一种简单、通用且标签高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Motivation: 现有的音频驱动人体动画生成方法在生成高分辨率、长时程视频时，存在身份漂移、颜色偏移和场景不稳定的问题，并且手部动作建模不足，导致明显的扭曲和与音频不匹配。

Method: 提出一种粗到精的框架 InfinityHuman，首先生成音频同步的表示，然后使用姿势引导的细化器逐步细化为高分辨率、长时程的视频。姿势序列与外观解耦，抵抗时间退化；姿势引导的细化器采用稳定的姿势和初始帧作为视觉锚点，以减少漂移并改善唇部同步。引入用高质量手部运动数据训练的手部特定奖励机制，以提高语义准确性和手势真实感。

Result: 在 EMTD 和 HDTF 数据集上的实验表明，InfinityHuman 在视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步方面取得了最先进的性能。消融研究进一步证实了每个模块的有效性。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman 框架能够有效生成高质量、长时程的音频驱动人体动画视频，并在视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步方面表现出色。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

Result: SalViT360 和 SalViT360-AV 在预测 360 度场景中观看者注意力方面显着优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中集成空间音频线索对于全向视频中的准确显着性预测至关重要。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 现有的xAI方法主要关注解释单个样本，而忽略了解释视觉模型在大型数据集上的整体行为。理解视觉模型在一般图像上的行为对于防止有偏见的判断和识别模型的趋势和模式非常重要。

Result: 该pipeline可以用于发现失败案例，并以最小的努力深入了解视觉模型。

Conclusion: 通过集成视觉模型开发和xAI分析，可以促进图像分析的进步。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck

novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert

develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 本研究利用MedNeXt-L-k5模型自动分割脑部血管周围间隙(PVS)，该模型在T2w图像上表现良好，但在T1w图像上的泛化能力有限。结果表明，对于PVS分割，全局上下文信息可能不是必需的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑血管周围间隙(PVS)的扩大是脑小血管疾病、阿尔茨海默病、中风和衰老相关神经退行性变的生物标志物。手动分割PVS耗时且信度低，现有深度学习模型性能适中且泛化能力差。

Method: 采用了MedNeXt-L-k5模型，分别在同质的T2w MRI数据集和异质的T1w MRI数据集上进行训练，并使用交叉验证评估模型性能。

Result: 在T2w图像上，模型Dice系数达到0.88+/-0.06。在T1w图像上，模型Dice系数为0.58+/-0.09。LOSOCV下，模型Dice系数较低。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5为自动PVS分割提供了一种有效的解决方案，但transformer模型中的注意力机制对于提高PVS分割的准确性不是必需的。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种免训练、反馈驱动的自适应框架，通过将基于输出的patch级别对应关系反馈到中间注意力层，来增强内部表示和最终预测之间的语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现出色，但由于定位不佳，在开放词汇分割方面表现不佳。之前的方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但这种一致性不能始终如一地传播到最终输出。

Method: 设计了关键模块，包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的剪枝以进行稀疏自适应和自适应集成，以有效地反馈输出一致性线索。该方法作为一个插件模块，无缝集成到具有三个backbone的四种最先进的方法中。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，该方法始终如一地提高了它们的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过利用模型的输出作为更强的空间一致性先验，增强了内部表示和最终预测之间的语义一致性。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个探究框架，用于分析多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)如何在不同层处理视觉和文本输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对MLLM的内部处理动态研究不足，需要进行更深入的分析。

Method: 通过训练线性分类器来预测每一层提取的token嵌入中的细粒度视觉类别，并使用标准化的anchor question。通过三种类型的受控prompt变体评估这些探针：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 研究结果表明，MLLM中存在一个一致的阶段性结构，早期层执行视觉基础，中间层支持词汇集成和语义推理，最后层准备特定于任务的输出。虽然整体阶段性结构在视觉token化、指令调整数据和预训练语料库的变化中保持稳定，但每个阶段的特定层分配随着基本LLM架构的变化而显着变化。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个关于MLLM的逐层组织的统一视角，并提供了一种轻量级的、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种有监督字典学习方法，将视觉语言共同嵌入空间分解为多个概念特定的成分向量，以实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言共同嵌入网络（如CLIP）提供了一个具有语义信息的潜在嵌入空间，但该空间可能包含复杂场景的内容信息，需要解耦。

Method: 提出了一种有监督字典学习方法，通过学习稀疏、非负的向量组合来估计线性合成模型，该模型将嵌入分解为多个概念特定的成分向量。利用文本共同嵌入，找到与概念组的原子最匹配的语义描述，并利用零样本分类提供实例级的多标签。

Result: SLiCS实现了更精确的概念过滤图像检索，并在TiTok和DINOv2等嵌入上进行了验证。

Conclusion: 通过稀疏线性概念子空间（SLiCS）提供的解耦嵌入，实现了更精确的概念过滤图像检索。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型(VLMs)在临床应用中面临严重的安全问题，如PHI泄露、数据泄露和网络威胁。

Method: 提出了一个名为MedFoundationHub的GUI工具包，它支持医生手动选择模型，工程师高效部署模型，并通过Docker确保隐私保护。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub工具包旨在解决医学VLMs的安全问题，但评估结果表明现有VLM仍存在一些局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Motivation: 现有的多任务密集预测方法需要在交互完整性和计算效率之间进行权衡。

Method: 提出了双向交互Mamba (BIM)，结合了新颖的扫描机制，包括双向交互扫描(BI-Scan)和多尺度扫描(MS-Scan)。

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个基准测试中，BIM的表现优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: BIM模型在多任务密集预测任务中表现出色，解决了交互完整性和计算效率之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频引导视觉编辑方法通常需要在特定数据集上进行训练，以使音频与文本对齐，从而限制了它们在现实世界中的推广。因此需要额外的非文本编辑提示。

Result: 在各种编辑任务上的综合实验表明，我们的框架通过结合来自音频的丰富信息，在处理复杂的编辑场景方面表现出色，而纯文本方法则失败。

Conclusion: 该框架擅长通过结合来自音频的丰富信息来处理复杂的编辑场景，而纯文本方法则失败。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架，用于解决单正多标签学习（SPML）问题，该框架可以有效地从不同的伪标签中学习并减轻噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高成本和工作量，完全注释大型数据集通常是不切实际的，这促使人们研究从部分注释数据中学习。在单正多标签学习（SPML）的极端情况下，每个图像仅提供一个正标签，而所有其他标签仍未注释。传统方法容易产生不准确和假阴性，并且集成各种伪标签策略会引入额外的噪声。

Method: 我们提出了广义伪标签鲁棒损失（GPR Loss）和动态增强多焦点伪标签（DAMP）技术。它们共同构成了自适应和高效的视觉语言伪标签（AEVLP）框架。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，我们的框架显着提高了多标签分类的性能，实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出的AEVLP框架在多标签分类任务中取得了显著的进展，并在四个基准数据集上实现了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 该方法能够以更低的延迟实现更精确的特征表示，从而在视觉检测任务中实现高性能和超低延迟。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Motivation: 现有显著性目标检测 (SOD) 方法容易丢失细节、模糊边缘以及在复杂场景中单模态信息融合不足。

Method: 1. 设计了动态不确定性图卷积模块 (DUGC)，通过基于空间语义距离构建的稀疏图传播层间的不确定性，并结合通道自适应交互，有效提高了小结构和边缘区域的检测精度。
2. 提出了多模态协同融合策略 (MCF)，该策略使用可学习的模态门控权重来加权融合 RGB、深度和边缘特征的注意力图。它可以根据不同的场景动态调整每个模态的重要性，有效抑制冗余或干扰信息，并加强跨模态之间的语义互补性和一致性，从而提高在遮挡、弱纹理或背景干扰下识别显著区域的能力。
3. 通过多尺度 BCE 和 IoU 损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导的监督机制，优化像素级别和区域级别的检测性能。

Result: 在大多数常见基准数据集上，DUP-MCRNet 优于各种 SOD 方法，尤其是在边缘清晰度和对复杂背景的鲁棒性方面。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet 有效地解决了现有 SOD 方法的不足，并在复杂场景下实现了更准确和鲁棒的显著性目标检测。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Motivation: 现有的端到端可训练深度学习方法在检测视图中尺度一致偏小或偏大的行人，以及视图间尺度差异巨大的行人时表现不佳，因为它们没有利用多尺度图像特征来生成BEV特征并检测行人。

Method: MSMVD通过将从各个视图提取的多尺度图像特征逐尺度地投影到BEV空间，生成多尺度BEV特征。然后，MSMVD通过使用特征金字塔网络处理多尺度BEV特征，结合多个视图不同尺度的信息。

Conclusion: MSMVD方法有效地利用了多尺度图像特征，显著提高了多视角行人检测的性能。

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature

semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

*Ayaka Tsutsumi,Guang Li,Ren Togo,Takahiro Ogawa,Satoshi Kondo,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的医学图像分类方法，该方法结合了双模型权重选择和自知识蒸馏（SKD）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实世界的医疗环境中，部署大规模模型通常受到计算资源约束的限制，这给它们的实际应用带来了重大挑战。因此，开发能够实现与大规模模型相当的性能，同时保持计算效率的轻量级模型至关重要。

Method: 采用双模型权重选择策略，该策略使用从大型预训练模型导出的权重初始化两个轻量级模型，从而实现有效的知识转移。接下来，将 SKD 应用于这些选定的模型，允许使用广泛的初始权重配置，而不会产生额外的过度计算成本，然后针对目标分类任务进行微调。

Result: 在公开可用的数据集（胸部 X 光图像、肺部计算机断层扫描和脑部磁共振成像扫描）上进行的大量实验表明，与现有方法相比，该方法具有卓越的性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过将双模型权重选择与自知识蒸馏相结合，该方法克服了传统方法的局限性，传统方法通常无法在紧凑模型中保留关键信息。

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于LiDAR点云压缩的快速预测编码框架，通过几何重密集化和跨尺度特征传播模块来提高压缩效率和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在极度稀疏的几何细节上进行有效的上下文建模，限制了压缩性能和速度，针对这个问题。

Method: 提出了Geometry Re-Densification模块和Cross-scale Feature Propagation模块。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上实现了最先进的压缩率和实时性能，在12位量化下编码和解码均达到26 FPS。

Conclusion: 通过集成这两个模块，该方法产生了一种紧凑的特征表示，可以提供有效的上下文建模并加速编码过程。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究利用视频数据中的常识先验知识来缓解3D数据稀缺的问题，并提出了Droplet3D-4M数据集和Droplet3D生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D数据量不足，限制了3D生成模型的发展。

Method: 利用包含多视角信息的视频数据，提供空间一致性先验；利用视频中丰富的语义信息，使生成内容更符合文本提示和语义。

Result: 提出的方法能够生成空间一致且语义合理的内容，并有潜力扩展到场景级别的应用。

Conclusion: 视频中的常识先验知识能够显著促进3D内容的生成。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,

Motivation: 现实世界中收集极端案例进行自动驾驶系统的训练和验证成本高且危险。通过编辑捕获的传感器数据中的对象可以有效生成多样化的场景。

Method: 利用编辑对象的3D高斯表示作为密集先验，注入到去噪过程中，以确保精确的姿势控制和空间一致性。采用场景级3D边界框布局来重建非目标对象的遮挡区域。为了引导编辑对象的外观细节，我们结合了分层细粒度特征作为生成过程中的额外条件。

Result: 在Waymo开放数据集上的实验表明，G^2Editor有效地支持了在统一框架内的对象重新定位、插入和删除，在姿势可控性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法，同时也使下游数据驱动的任务受益。

Conclusion: G^2Editor框架在驾驶视频中实现了逼真且精确的物体编辑，优于现有方法，并能提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种病理信息驱动的域随机化策略，通过模拟脑部改变来解决胎儿脑分割中CCD数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的胎儿脑分割对于提取生物标志物和评估神经发育至关重要，但CCD的稀有性严重限制了带注释的数据，阻碍了深度学习模型的泛化。

Method: 提出一种病理信息驱动的域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入到合成数据生成流程中。通过仅从健康数据中模拟不同的脑部改变，我们的方法能够在不需要病理注释的情况下实现稳健的分割。

Result: 在包含248个健康胎儿、26个CCD胎儿和47个其他脑部病变的队列中验证了该方法，在CCD病例中取得了实质性改进，同时保持了健康胎儿和其他病变的性能。病理信息驱动的增强将健康病例的LCC估计误差从1.89毫米降低到0.80毫米，CCD病例的LCC估计误差从10.9毫米降低到0.7毫米。

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖学先验知识纳入合成数据流程可以有效缓解数据稀缺问题，并加强对罕见但临床上重要的畸形分析。

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Motivation: 现有的语音识别系统对于听力障碍人士来说仍然难以使用。手语和唇语等视觉替代方案是有效的替代方案，但这些模式在很大程度上是孤立研究的，它们在统一框架中的整合仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 设计了一个统一的、与模态无关的架构，能够有效地处理异构输入；探索模态之间的协同作用，特别是唇动在手语理解中作为非手动线索的作用； 达到与专门用于单个任务的最新模型相当或优于其性能。

Result: 在 SLT、VSR、ASR 和 AVSR 方面，实现了与特定于任务的最新模型相当或更好的性能。此外，分析表明，将唇动作为单独的模态进行显式建模可以显着提高 SLT 性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效地处理手语、唇动和音频的各种组合，用于生成口语文本，并在多个任务上实现了与或优于现有技术水平的性能。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态推理或外部视觉语言模型(VLM)，存在复杂性和由于缺乏端到端训练而导致的次优性能等问题。

Method: 设计了一个强化多轮推理框架 Video-MTR，它能迭代地选择关键视频片段，并引入门控双层奖励系统，结合轨迹级别奖励和turn级别奖励，优化视频片段选择和问题理解。

Result: 在 VideoMME, MLVU, 和 EgoSchema 等基准测试中，Video-MTR 在准确性和效率上都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Video-MTR 推进了长视频理解技术的发展水平。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法未能解决单目3D目标检测中固有的双重不确定性：语义不确定性和几何不确定性。

Method: 提出了双重不确定性优化（DUO）框架，该框架通过凸优化视角引入了焦点损失的凸结构，并设计了一种语义感知的法向场约束。

Result: 大量实验表明，DUO在各种数据集和领域转移类型上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUO框架通过联合最小化语义和几何不确定性，实现了鲁棒的单目3D目标检测。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces IAENet, a framework that combines 2D and 3D models for surface anomaly detection. It uses an Importance-Aware Fusion module to dynamically reweight anomaly scores from each source, improving accuracy and reducing false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that 3D point cloud-based anomaly detection is underexplored due to the lack of pretrained foundation backbones compared to 2D image-based methods.

Method: The method is an ensemble framework called Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), which combines 2D pretrained expert models with 3D expert models. It introduces an Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module to dynamically assess the contribution of each source and reweight their anomaly scores. Critical loss functions guide the optimization of IAF.

Result: IAENet achieves state-of-the-art results on MVTec 3D-AD with a markedly lower false positive rate.

Conclusion: The IAENet framework demonstrates practical value for industrial deployment by effectively combining 2D and 3D models for surface anomaly detection.

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

TL;DR: DescriptiveEdit: re-frames instruction-based image editing as reference-image-based text-to-image generation, preserving generative power without architectural changes or inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic image editing is challenging due to reconstruction errors in inversion-based algorithms and limited dataset quality/scale in instruction-based models.

Method: Introduces a Cross-Attentive UNet that injects reference image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process.

Result: Improves editing accuracy and consistency on the Emu Edit benchmark.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit overcomes instruction dataset limitations, integrates with extensions like ControlNet/IP-Adapter, and is more scalable due to its text-to-image nature.

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖目标数据的特征，容易导致混淆和引入学习偏差，且伪标签质量无法保证，存在误差累积问题。

Method: 该框架使用双分类器将目标数据的完整特征表示解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，并通过保持子特征和完整特征之间的一致性，以及自适应阈值和置信度评分来减少伪标签的噪声，从而进行自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在持续测试时适应场景中表现出一致的性能。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Motivation: 相机标定的质量对于评估新视角合成的进展至关重要，因为标定上的1像素误差对重建质量有显著影响。虽然真实场景没有ground truth，但标定的质量是通过新视角合成的质量来评估的。

Method: 提出使用3DGS模型通过反向传播新视角颜色损失相对于相机参数来微调相机标定。

Result: 新的标定本身在3DGS用作参考的数据集上带来了平均0.4 dB PSNR的改进。

Conclusion: 微调可能很长，其适用性取决于训练时间的严格性，但对于参考场景（如Mip-NeRF 360）的标定，新视角质量的 stakes 是最重要的。

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Result: 在不同的肿瘤体积分割任务上的经验验证表明，该方法实现了良好的分割性能，显着优于最先进的ADA方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的主动学习框架，可以有效地减少医学图像分割中的标注成本，并且在实验中表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

### [83] [Enhancing Pseudo-Boxes via Data-Level LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Unsupervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20530)
*Mingqian Ji,Jian Yang,Shanshan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据级融合框架，用于无监督3D目标检测，该框架在早期阶段整合RGB图像和LiDAR数据，以提高伪盒子的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LiDAR的3D目标检测器通常依赖于手动标注的标签进行训练，以获得良好的性能。然而，获得高质量的3D标签是耗时且费力的。为了解决这个问题，最近的工作探索了无监督的3D目标检测，通过引入RGB图像作为辅助模态来辅助伪盒子的生成。然而，这些方法只是简单地整合了由LiDAR点云和RGB图像生成的伪盒子。然而，这种标签级的融合策略对伪盒子的质量带来的改进有限，因为它忽略了LiDAR和RGB图像数据在互补性方面的作用。

Method: 该方法利用视觉基础模型对图像进行实例分割和深度估计，并引入了一种双向融合方法，其中真实点从2D空间获取类别标签，而2D像素被投影到3D以增强真实点密度。为了减轻深度和分割估计带来的噪声，提出了一种局部和全局滤波方法，该方法应用局部半径滤波来抑制深度估计误差，并应用全局统计滤波来去除分割引起的异常值。此外，该方法还提出了一种基于数据级融合的动态自进化策略，该策略在密集表示下迭代地细化伪盒子，从而显著提高了定位精度。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的大量实验表明，通过该方法训练的检测器明显优于通过以前最先进的方法训练的检测器，在nuScenes验证基准上获得了28.4$\%$的mAP。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的数据级融合框架，用于无监督3D目标检测，并在nuScenes数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在远程医疗或紧急情况下，当传统方法不可用或不切实际时，利用机器学习模型通过相机图像估算身体质量指数（BMI）能够实现快速体重评估。

Method: 该方法使用姿势聚类和人员检测的自动过滤方法来管理数据集，移除低质量图像，并使用高质量图像进行训练。使用全身体图像在WayBED数据上实现了7.9%的MAPE。

Result: 在WayBED数据集上实现了7.9%的MAPE，在VisualBodyToBMI数据集上实现了13%的MAPE。在VisualBodyToBMI数据集上微调模型后，实现了8.56%的MAPE。

Conclusion: 本文发布了完整的模型训练、过滤和移动部署的CLAID软件包的开源代码。

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

TL;DR: 本研究旨在更好地理解领域自适应 (DA) 对自然图像和医学图像的好处，通过使用七种广泛使用的 DA 技术对五个自然数据集和八个医学数据集进行了 557 项模拟研究，涵盖了各种场景，例如分布外、动态数据流和有限的训练样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域自适应 (DA) 技术有潜力通过利用来自源域的信息来缓解训练集和测试集之间的分布差异。在图像分类中，DA 的大多数进展都是使用自然图像而不是更难处理的医学数据取得的。此外，即使对于自然图像，使用主流数据集也可能导致性能偏差。

Method: 本研究使用七种广泛使用的 DA 技术对五个自然数据集和八个医学数据集进行了 557 项模拟研究，涵盖了各种场景，例如分布外、动态数据流和有限的训练样本。

Result: 实验结果表明，深度子域自适应网络 (DSAN) 算法表现出色。该算法在使用 Resnet50 的 COVID-19 数据集中实现了可行的分类精度 (91.2%)，并且与基线相比，在动态数据流 DA 场景中显示出重要的精度提升 (+6.7%)。结果还表明，DSAN 在 COVID-19 和皮肤癌数据集上进行评估时表现出卓越的可解释性水平。

Conclusion: 这些结果有助于理解 DA 技术，并为模型有效适应医学数据提供了宝贵的见解。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CLAB的对比学习方法，用于提高视频目标检测在图像退化情况下的鲁棒性，且不会增加推理时的计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测面临图像退化问题，如运动模糊、遮挡和形变，使其比静态图像中的目标检测更具挑战性。以往方法虽通过特征聚合和复杂后处理技术提高了性能，但也增加了计算成本。

Method: 采用对比学习辅助分支（CLAB），使用对比损失增强视频目标检测器骨干网络的特征表示能力，并提出动态损失权重策略，在训练初期强调辅助特征学习，随着训练收敛逐渐优先考虑检测任务。

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，使用ResNet-101和ResNeXt-101时，CLAB分别达到84.0% mAP和85.2% mAP，实现了基于CNN模型的state-of-the-art性能，且无需额外的后处理方法。

Conclusion: CLAB方法在不增加计算负担的情况下，有效提高了视频目标检测在图像退化情况下的鲁棒性，并在ImageNet VID数据集上取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了针对CLIP视觉编码器的印刷攻击，并提出了一种无需微调的防御方法，通过选择性地消除印刷电路中的注意力头来提高模型鲁棒性，同时保持在标准ImageNet上的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是现有的多模态系统容易受到印刷攻击的影响，攻击者通过将文本注入图像来达到恶意目的，包括误分类、恶意内容生成，甚至破解视觉-语言模型。

Method: 该论文首先分析了CLIP视觉编码器在印刷攻击下的行为，确定了模型后半部分中专门提取印刷信息并将其传输到cls token的注意力头。然后，基于这些发现，提出了一种通过选择性地消除包含注意力头的印刷电路来防御CLIP模型的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在Typographic ImageNet-100上性能提高了19.6%，而标准ImageNet-100的准确率下降不到1%。该无需训练的方法与依赖于微调的现有最先进的印刷防御方法相比，仍具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 论文发布了一系列对印刷攻击具有更强鲁棒性的阅读障碍CLIP模型，这些模型可以作为安全关键型应用的直接替代品，在这些应用中，基于文本的操纵风险超过了文本识别的效用。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

TL;DR: FastFit: a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual try-on methods can't support multi-reference outfit compositions and are inefficient due to redundant re-computation of reference features.

Method: Proposes FastFit, using a Semi-Attention mechanism and class embeddings to decouple reference feature encoding from denoising.

Result: Achieves an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on key fidelity metrics.

Conclusion: Introduces DressCode-MR dataset and demonstrates FastFit's superiority in speed and fidelity on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Motivation: 热像仪在低光照条件下感知户外环境方面表现出色，但在捕获由相似材料制成的物体的标牌时会遇到挑战，这可能会给自动驾驶系统中准确理解语义带来安全风险。神经形态视觉相机，也称为事件相机，可以异步检测光强度变化，并且已证明在高速、低光照交通环境中有效。认识到这两种模态的互补特性。

Conclusion: 所提出的 UTA-Sign 方法有效地利用了热像仪和事件相机的互补特性，提高了低照度环境下交通标志的识别能力。

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的主动防御 Deepfake 方法，能够在一定程度上缓解 Deepfake 技术带来的风险。

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)

optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有前景的解决方案，利用合成 MFI 数据增强技术来优化缺陷定位过程。

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于 GAN 的 DRA 框架，具有渐进式特征优化 (PFO)，它可以将生成器分解为分层块并逐步细化中间表示，以提高重建图像的语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络 (DNN) 日益复杂，导致采用拆分推理 (SI)，这是一种协作范例，可在边缘设备和云之间划分计算，以减少延迟并保护用户隐私。然而，数据重建攻击 (DRA) 的最新进展表明，SI 中交换的中间特征可用于恢复敏感输入数据，从而带来严重的隐私风险。现有的 DRA 通常仅对浅层模型有效，并且无法充分利用语义先验，从而限制了它们的重建质量和跨数据集和模型架构的泛化能力。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的基于 GAN 的 DRA 框架，具有渐进式特征优化 (PFO)，它可以将生成器分解为分层块并逐步细化中间表示，以提高重建图像的语义保真度。为了稳定优化并提高图像真实感，我们在重建过程中引入了 L1 球约束。

Result: 大量实验表明，我们的方法优于先前的攻击，尤其是在高分辨率场景、分布外设置以及针对更深层和更复杂的 DNN 时。

Conclusion: 我们的方法优于先前的攻击，尤其是在高分辨率场景、分布外设置以及针对更深层和更复杂的 DNN 时。

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

*Yiguo Jiang,Xiaodong Cun,Yong Zhang,Yudian Zheng,Fan Tang,Chi-Man Pun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoCAST是一个用于生成具有生动表情的说话人像视频的扩散框架，通过两个关键模块实现精确的文本驱动情感合成，并提出了一个情感说话人数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感说话人像合成方法在控制灵活性、运动自然性和表达质量方面存在局限性，且现有数据集主要在实验室环境中收集，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了EmoCAST，一个基于扩散的框架，包含文本引导的分离情感模块以增强空间知识，以及情感音频注意力模块以捕捉情感和音频之间的相互作用。

Result: EmoCAST在生成逼真、情感丰富且音频同步的说话人头部视频方面取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EmoCAST有效地解决了现有情感说话人像合成的挑战，并在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Result: 该方法在挑战赛排行榜上获得第二名。

Conclusion: 该方法具有支持临床乳腺 MRI 判读的潜力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

### [98] [AvatarBack: Back-Head Generation for Complete 3D Avatars from Front-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20623)
*Shiqi Xin,Xiaolin Zhang,Yanbin Liu,Peng Zhang,Caifeng Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AvatarBack，一个用于重建完整和一致的3D高斯头像的框架，通过显式建模缺失的后脑区域来解决现有方法中后脑重建质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖正面图像，导致后脑重建质量差，几何不一致，结构模糊，降低了重建头像的真实感。

Method: AvatarBack集成了两个核心技术创新：Subject-specific Generator (SSG)和Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA)。SSG利用生成先验从稀疏的正面输入合成身份一致的、合理的后视图伪图像，提供鲁棒的多视图监督。ASA采用在训练期间优化的可学习变换矩阵，有效地解决固有的姿势和坐标差异，从而实现这些合成视图和3D高斯表示之间的精确几何对齐。

Result: 在NeRSemble和K-hairstyle数据集上的大量实验表明，AvatarBack显著提高了后脑重建质量，同时保持了正面逼真度。重建的头像在不同的运动下保持一致的视觉逼真度，并且保持完全可动画。

Conclusion: AvatarBack可以重建完整和一致的3D高斯头像，显著提高了后脑重建质量，同时保持了正面逼真度，并且重建的头像在不同的运动下保持一致的视觉逼真度，并且保持完全可动画。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用基础模型来改进艺术品中的面部识别，以解决传统面部识别模型在绘画作品中表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术史学家需要识别历史绘画中的人物，但这项任务主观且受数据和风格变化的限制。传统面部识别模型在绘画作品中表现不佳。

Method: 通过微调基础模型并将其嵌入与传统面部识别网络相结合。

Result: 结果表明，与当前最先进的方法相比，该方法有显著改进。基础模型可以弥补传统方法无效的差距。

Conclusion: 基础模型有潜力改进艺术品中的面部识别。

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

*Ayan Banerjee,Fernando Vilariño,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti是一个文本引导的涂鸦生成框架，旨在极端风格转换下保持面部特征的同一性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涂鸦这种高对比度、抽象的媒介中，细微的面部扭曲会消除对象的识别性，从而破坏个人和文化真实性。因此，论文旨在解决在风格转换中保持面部识别的问题。

Method: CraftGraffiti首先通过LoRA微调的预训练扩散transformer进行涂鸦风格转换，然后通过面部一致的自注意力机制来增强注意力层，显式地嵌入身份信息，从而保证身份的保真度。使用CLIP引导的提示扩展来实现姿势定制，无需关键点。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在面部特征一致性方面具有竞争力，并且在美学和人类偏好得分方面达到了最先进的水平。在Cruilla Festival上的实际部署也突出了该系统在现实世界中的创造性影响。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了尊重身份的AI辅助艺术的目标，为在创造性AI应用中融合风格自由和可识别性提供了一种原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成 (RAG) 在高风险领域中，对噪声或矛盾证据敏感，且决策过程不透明、随机。

Method: 提出 ArgRAG，用结构化推理代替黑盒推理。ArgRAG 从检索到的文档构建定量双极论证框架 (QBAF)，并在渐进语义下执行确定性推理。

Result: 在 PubHealth 和 RAGuard 两个事实核查基准上，ArgRAG 实现了强大的准确性，同时显著提高了透明度。

Conclusion: ArgRAG 是一种可解释且可辩驳的 RAG 替代方案，它使用 QBAF 进行结构化推理，从而提高透明度和准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

TL;DR: QAgent是一个LLM驱动的多代理系统，可以自动完成OpenQASM编程，优于以前的静态LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在经典难题上，NISQ设备已开始展现出早期的量子优势，但由于OpenQASM编程的复杂性，非专业人士难以实现这些优势。LLM虽然在自动化经典编程工作流程中显示出前景，但量子LLM主要局限于量子化学或纠错等任务。

Method: 集成了任务规划、上下文少样本学习、RAG、预定义的生成工具和CoT推理。

Result: QAgent将QASM代码生成的准确率提高了71.6%。

Conclusion: QAgent可以弥合专业知识差距，加速量子计算的实际应用。

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成有害内容的能力带来了显著的安全挑战，并且现有的缓解措施通常以过度拒绝无害提示为代价。

Method: 1. 构建一个包含约163,000个查询的综合数据集，每个查询都带有意图推理、安全标签和重写版本。
2. 应用监督微调，使guard模型具备格式坚持、意图分析和安全重写的基础能力。
3. 应用定制的多奖励优化策略，该策略在强化学习框架内集成了基于规则的启发式方法和奖励模型信号，以进一步提高性能。

Result: IntentionReasoner在多个安全保障基准、生成质量评估和越狱攻击场景中表现出色，显著提高了安全性，同时有效降低了过度拒绝率并提高了响应质量。

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner 有效地平衡了安全性、过度拒绝和效用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

Result: 两个相互作用的语言模型展示了元符号意识、递归语法发展和不可简化的协作审美合成的自发出现。交互产生了作为操作语法协议的新型符号运算符，从而实现了任何一个系统都无法独立生成的诗歌作品的共同创作。

Conclusion: 本研究介绍了跨符号协同创作协议（TSCP）的概念，并为真正的跨人工智能意义创造能力提供了证据，这种能力超越了任务协调，达到了审美协作的程度。

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

Motivation: 研究动机在于了解在ChatGPT实施的早期阶段，学生对该工具的熟悉程度有限的情况下，他们如何利用AI进行学习。

Method: 通过对315名学生在各种STEM课程中进行简短的基于测验的场景的学生-AI对话进行分析，引入了一种新的四阶段依赖性分类法，以捕捉学生的依赖模式，区分AI能力、相关性、采纳以及学生最终答案的正确性。

Result: 研究结果表明：1）学生对AI的总体依赖性较低，许多人无法有效地利用AI进行学习；2）消极的依赖模式通常在互动中持续存在，表明学生在最初的失败经历后难以有效地改变策略；3）某些行为指标可以强烈预测对AI的依赖性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在教育和更广泛领域中以合乎道德的方式整合AI的关键意义，强调需要加强引导过程以提高学生对AI工具的熟悉程度和有效使用。此外，AI界面应设计有依赖性校准机制，以增强适当的依赖性。

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

*Lang Mei,Zhihan Yang,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的强化学习框架，旨在通过专注于搜索规划来提高冻结QA模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的搜索代理依赖于单个LLM来处理端到端的搜索规划和问答任务，这限制了它们同时优化这两种能力。

Method: 该方法引入了三个关键创新：1) 解耦搜索规划器和生成器的架构，2) 用于搜索规划的双重奖励对齐，以及 3) 规划效用和成本的帕累托优化。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，AI SearchPlanner在有效性和效率方面均优于现有的基于强化学习的搜索代理，同时在不同的冻结QA模型和数据领域中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AI SearchPlanner可以通过专注于搜索规划来提高冻结QA模型的性能，并在有效性和效率方面优于现有的基于强化学习的搜索代理。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为P2C（Path-to-Counterfactuals）的与模型无关的框架，该框架生成一个计划（有序的行动序列），将不利的结果转化为因果一致的有利结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险环境中，机器学习模型越来越多地驱动决策，因此需要透明度。然而，关键的挑战是在透明度（阐明“为什么”做出决定）与补救措施（提供关于“如何”从不利结果中实现有利结果的可操作步骤）之间取得平衡。当前的 counterfactual 方法存在局限性：1）它们通常忽略特征之间的因果依赖关系，2）它们通常假设所有干预都可以同时发生，这在实际场景中是不现实的，在实际场景中，行动通常是按顺序进行的。因此，这些 counterfactual 在现实世界中通常是无法实现的。

Method: P2C 通过以下方式解决了这两个限制：1）显式建模特征之间的因果关系，2）确保计划中的每个中间状态都是可行且因果有效的。P2C 使用面向目标的 Answer Set Programming 系统 s(CASP) 来生成计划，该计划考虑了由于因果依赖关系而自动发生的特征变化。

Result: P2C 改进了成本（努力）计算，仅计算用户主动进行的更改，从而产生实际的成本估算。此外，P2C 强调了其因果规划器如何优于缺乏因果知识的标准规划器，因此可以生成非法操作。

Conclusion: 总的来说，这篇论文提出了P2C框架，它可以生成可行的、因果一致的补救计划，从而提高机器学习模型决策的透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

*Simin Ma,Shujian Liu,Jun Tan,Yebowen Hu,Song Wang,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Sanqiang Zhao,Liwei Wu,Jianbing Han,Kaiqiang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为任务中心指令增强（TCIA）的框架，用于系统地扩展指令，同时保持多样性和任务对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常忽略实际应用中的一个重要因素：任务相关性。在实践中，只有少数实际应用程序需要真正的通用模型；大多数应用程序受益于针对其特定用例量身定制的特定于任务的知识。因此，开发不仅保持多样性，而且还针对特定、实际场景进行优化的指令增强方法至关重要。

Method: 通过在离散查询-约束空间中表示指令，TCIA创建了一组丰富的任务相关指令，并使模型能够推广到这些特定于任务的指令，而不会牺牲整体性能。

Result: 实验表明，TCIA将开源LLM在四个实际的、特定于任务的应用程序中的性能平均提高了8.7%，在某些情况下优于领先的闭源模型。

Conclusion: 这些改进不会影响一般的指令遵循能力，使TCIA成为将LLM调整到实际的、以任务为中心的应用程序的可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化大型语言模型在答案生成过程中的不确定性。

Method: 利用模型自身的token级别预测熵来捕捉生成过程中不确定性的演变。

Result: EAS与不同模型和数据集的答案熵高度相关；在训练数据选择中，EAS能识别高潜力样本，并在同等样本预算下持续优于Pass Rate过滤，提高学生模型在数学基准测试中的准确性。

Conclusion: EAS高效且可解释，为LLM训练中的不确定性建模和数据质量评估提供了一种实用工具。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Motivation: Inefficient experience generation hampers the development of capable Agentic AI systems, especially in complex benchmarks like GAIA.

Method: Introduces AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale agent-environment interaction.

Result: Trained a Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%.

Conclusion: AWorld and the resulting agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training pipeline.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

*Donglin Wang,Weiyun Liang,Chunyuan Chen,Jing Xu,Yulong Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Governable AI (GAI) framework to address the security risks of advanced AI by using external enforcement based on cryptographic mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI safety approaches have limitations when facing AI with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence.

Method: The GAI framework uses a rule enforcement module (REM) and a governable secure super-platform (GSSP) to enforce governance rules.

Result: The paper presents a formal proof of the security properties and demonstrates effectiveness through a prototype implementation.

Conclusion: The GAI framework provides a feasible and generalizable technical pathway for the safety governance of AI.

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型生成合成数据，以增强健康相关事实核查的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关内容的事实核查因标注训练数据的有限性而具有挑战性。

Method: 提出一个合成数据生成管道，该管道利用大型语言模型（LLM）来扩充健康相关事实核查的训练数据。该管道总结源文档，将摘要分解为原子事实，并使用LLM构建句子-事实蕴含表。从表中的蕴含关系，我们进一步生成具有二元真实性标签的合成文本-声明对。

Result: 在两个公共数据集PubHealth和SciFact上的评估表明，与仅在原始数据上训练的模型相比，我们的管道将F1分数分别提高了0.019和0.049。

Conclusion: 这些结果突出了LLM驱动的合成数据增强在提高健康相关事实核查器性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动练级机器人在大型多人在线角色扮演游戏中被大规模使用，破坏了游戏平衡和公平性。检测这些机器人具有挑战性，因为它们模仿人类行为，并且惩罚性措施需要可解释的理由，以避免法律和用户体验问题。

Method: 本文利用对比表示学习和聚类技术，以完全无监督的方式识别具有相似练级模式的角色群体。此外，本文还引入了一个大型语言模型（LLM）作为辅助审查员，以验证聚类群体，有效地模仿了第二次人工判断。本文还介绍了一种基于增长曲线的可视化方法，以协助LLM和人工版主评估练级行为。

Result: 该协作方法提高了机器人检测工作流程的效率，同时保持了可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架支持MMORPG中可扩展且负责任的机器人监管。

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial

while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive

contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics

Result: 证明了GloVe和Word2Vec算法与度量MDS算法之间的等价性，并提供了一种在嵌入之前计算偏差的数学方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为比较词嵌入提供了一种数学上精确的方法，并为缓解语义空间层面的偏差提供了见解，从而推进了可解释人工智能领域的发展。

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)作为生成人工智能的一个活跃且有前景的领域，已经证明了在多个领域执行复杂任务的能力，包括数学和科学推理。本文旨在构建一个用于解决科学计算中代表性问题的agent框架。

Method: 该agent包含Consultant, Reviewer和Programmer三个模块，分别负责知识转移、代码生成和执行、以及自我调试和完善。通过端到端的审查机制，Programmer提供的可执行代码可以进行迭代修订。

Conclusion: 该agent框架将自动代码生成和审查确立为一种有前途的科学计算范例。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

Motivation: 现有基于多智能体强化学习的公交车群控制方法忽略了实际运营中异构线路、时刻表、动态需求和不同车队规模等问题，并且存在数据不平衡和收敛问题。

Method: 该方法将多智能体问题重新构建为单智能体问题，通过在状态空间中增加类别标识符（车辆ID、站点ID、时间段）以及数值特征（车头时距、占用率、速度）来捕捉智能体间的依赖关系。此外，设计了一种结构化奖励函数，以平衡均匀车头时距和时刻表遵守。

Result: 实验结果表明，改进的软Actor-Critic（SAC）算法比包括MADDPG在内的基准算法取得了更稳定和优越的性能（例如，在随机条件下为-430k vs. -530k）。

Conclusion: 单智能体深度强化学习，通过类别结构化和时间表感知奖励的增强，可以有效地管理非环线、真实世界环境中的公交车保持控制。这种范例为多智能体强化学习框架提供了一个稳健、可扩展的替代方案，尤其是在特定于智能体的经验不平衡的情况下。

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

Motivation: 现有的人工评估方法存在覆盖范围有限的问题，无法全面评估医学指南。

Method: 该方法将 WHO IMCI 手册转换为有向图，并使用图遍历生成问题，这些问题结合了特定年龄段的场景和上下文干扰。

Result: 该方法能够跨临床任务进行系统评估（准确率 45-67%），并发现模型在症状识别方面表现出色，但在分诊严重程度、治疗方案和后续护理方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种可扩展、防污染的解决方案，用于创建可动态生成的综合基准，包括在指南更新时。

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

### [123] [Efficient Neuro-Symbolic Learning of Constraints and Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20978)
*Marianne Defresne,Romain Gambardella,Sophie Barbe,Thomas Schiex*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的神经符号架构和损失函数，用于学习解决 NP-hard 推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型难以解决离散推理或优化问题，因此需要混合离散推理和神经网络的神经架构。

Method: 新的概率损失函数允许学习约束和目标，从而提供一个完整的模型，该模型可以被详细审查并用侧约束完成。通过将组合求解器推出训练循环，该架构还提供可扩展的训练，同时精确的推断可以获得最高的准确率。

Result: 在 Sudoku 基准的三个变体（符号、视觉和多解）上，该方法需要的训练时间只是其他混合方法的一小部分。在视觉 Min-Cut/Max-cut 任务中，它比以决策为中心的学习后悔专用损失更好地优化了后悔值。最后，它有效地学习了设计蛋白质的大型实际问题的能量优化公式。

Conclusion: 该方法可以有效地从自然输入中学习如何解决 NP-hard 推理问题。

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

*Junda Wang,Zonghai Yao,Zhichao Yang,Lingxi Li,Junhui Qian,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ChatThero的多智能体对话框架，用于改善药物滥用障碍(SUDs)的治疗效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物滥用障碍患者难以获得有效治疗，原因包括社会偏见、动机障碍和个性化支持不足。大型语言模型(LLMs)在心理健康方面显示出潜力，但缺乏与临床验证策略的紧密结合。

Method: 构建了一个高保真合成基准，并采用包含监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)的两阶段训练流程来训练ChatThero。该框架结合了动态患者建模、语境敏感的治疗对话以及基于认知行为疗法(CBT)和动机访谈(MI)的自适应说服策略。

Result: ChatThero在患者动机方面平均提升41.5%，治疗信心提升0.49%，解决困难案例的轮数比GPT-4o减少26%。自动化和人工临床评估均表明，ChatThero在共情、响应性和行为真实性方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: ChatThero框架为治疗性对话的严格研究提供了支持，并为研究和临床转化提供了可靠、可复制的基础。

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种专为无分叉区块链设计的数据库，旨在解决现有区块链数据库的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区块链技术中，L1区块链节点的运营成本仍然很高，其中区块链数据库（StateDB）是资源消耗大户，尤其是在无分叉区块链中，沿用传统分叉数据库导致效率低下。

Method: 设计了一种无分叉区块链数据库。

Result: 与基于geth的Fantom区块链客户端相比，存储减少了100倍，吞吐量提高了10倍。

Conclusion: 提出的无分叉区块链数据库显著提高了性能。

Abstract: Operating nodes in an L1 blockchain remains costly despite recent advances in
blockchain technology. One of the most resource-intensive components of a node
is the blockchain database, also known as StateDB, that manages balances,
nonce, code, and the persistent storage of accounts/smart contracts. Although
the blockchain industry has transitioned from forking to forkless chains due to
improved consensus protocols, forkless blockchains still rely on legacy forking
databases that are suboptimal for their purposes. In this paper, we propose a
forkless blockchain database, showing a 100x improvement in storage and a 10x
improvement in throughput compared to the geth-based Fantom Blockchain client.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在SQL中集成大型语言模型（LLM）以增强数据处理能力，并发现现有开源解决方案在功能、性能和可扩展性方面存在限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源SQL-invoked LLM集成功能有限且性能较差，无法满足日益增长的数据洞察需求。

Method: 通过五个代表性查询，对两个开源系统和一个企业平台进行了早期探索，以揭示当前SQL-invoked LLM集成的功能、性能和可扩展性限制。

Result: 发现了三个主要问题：强制结构化输出、优化资源利用率和改进查询计划。通过初步解决方案，观察到LLM驱动的SQL查询性能有所提升。

Conclusion: 更紧密的LLM+DBMS集成是实现LLM查询的可扩展和高效处理的关键。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as
text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering.
Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly
within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,
open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source
systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to
expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked
LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,
optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented
initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL
queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is
the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的自动特征增强框架 ReCoGNN，它使用从多个关系表中提取的特征来增强初始数据集，以支持预测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融、医疗保健和电子商务等领域，数据已成为推动创新的基础资产。在这些领域，通常采用基于关系表的预测建模，并且越来越强调通过自动化机器学习 (AutoML) 技术来减少人工工作量。这提出了一个有趣的问题：特征增强本身可以自动化，并且可以识别和利用与任务相关的关系信号吗？

Method: ReCoGNN 首先通过对表内属性关系进行建模来捕获每个表中的语义依赖关系，从而能够将表划分为结构化的、语义连贯的段。然后，它构建一个异构加权图，表示所有段之间的行间关系。最后，ReCoGNN 利用消息传递图神经网络在图中传播信息，指导特征选择并增强原始数据集。

Result: 在十个真实和合成数据集上进行的大量实验表明，在分类和回归任务中，ReCoGNN 始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReCoGNN 是一种有效的自动特征增强框架，可以在分类和回归任务中始终优于现有方法。

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.

TL;DR: 情感推荐系统旨在通过将推荐与用户的情感状态对齐来增强个性化。本综述对情感推荐系统进行了全面、系统的回顾，涵盖了不同的领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的情感推荐系统调查缺乏心理学基础的组织分类，并且通常只研究特定类型的情感状态或应用领域。本文旨在弥补这些不足。

Method: 本文从Scherer的情感状态类型学中提取，引入了一种分类方案，将系统分为四类：态度感知、情绪感知、情绪感知和混合型。此外，本文还记录了情感信号提取技术、系统架构和应用领域。

Result: 本文重点介绍了关键趋势、局限性和开放性挑战。

Conclusion: 本文旨在通过对现有研究和挑战的系统回顾，为推进情感驱动个性化的学术研究和行业应用提供全面的参考和有用的指导。

Abstract: Affective Recommender Systems are an emerging class of intelligent systems
that aim to enhance personalization by aligning recommendations with users'
affective states. Reflecting a growing interest, a number of surveys have been
published in this area, however they lack an organizing taxonomy grounded in
psychology and they often study only specific types of affective states or
application domains. This survey addresses these limitations by providing a
comprehensive, systematic review of affective recommender systems across
diverse domains. Drawing from Scherer's typology of affective states, we
introduce a classification scheme that organizes systems into four main
categories: attitude aware, emotion aware, mood aware, and hybrid. We further
document affective signal extraction techniques, system architectures, and
application areas, highlighting key trends, limitations, and open challenges.
As future research directions, we emphasize hybrid models that leverage
multiple types of affective states across different modalities, the development
of large-scale affect-aware datasets, and the need to replace the folk
vocabulary of affective states with a more precise terminology grounded in
cognitive and social psychology. Through its systematic review of existing
research and challenges, this survey aims to serve as a comprehensive reference
and a useful guide for advancing academic research and industry applications in
affect-driven personalization.

TL;DR: ELIXIR是一个多任务模型，它结合了评分预测和个性化评论生成，以提高推荐系统的透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法要么无法利用预训练Transformer模型的能力，要么遭受次优的适应和忽略方面建模，而方面建模对于个性化解释至关重要。

Method: ELIXIR联合学习用户和项目的全局和方面特定表示，优化总体评分、方面级别评分和评论生成，并使用个性化注意力来强调方面重要性。它基于T5-small模型。

Result: 在TripAdvisor和RateBeer上的实验结果表明，ELIXIR显著优于强大的基线模型，尤其是在评论生成方面。

Conclusion: ELIXIR在个性化上下文中有效地指导文本生成，并且优于使用更大模型的现有方法。

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose
ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a
multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review
generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of
users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review
generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based
on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based
architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where
state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer
demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models,
especially in review generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态推荐框架，该框架通过逐步语义残差量化（PSRQ）方法和多码本交叉注意（MCCA）网络，解决了现有方法中存在的模内语义退化和模间建模差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音乐推荐系统中，基于语义ID的多模态内容特征融合方法存在模内语义退化和模间建模差距的局限性，无法全面捕捉用户兴趣。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段的多模态推荐框架。第一阶段，通过PSRQ方法生成模态特定和模态联合的语义ID，显式地保留前缀语义特征。第二阶段，设计了一个MCCA网络，同时捕获模态特定兴趣并感知跨模态相关性。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架优于现有技术水平的基线模型。该框架已部署在中国最大的音乐流媒体平台之一，在线A/B测试证实商业指标得到显著改善。

Conclusion: 该框架在工业规模推荐系统中具有实际价值。

Abstract: In music recommendation systems, multimodal interest learning is pivotal,
which allows the model to capture nuanced preferences, including textual
elements such as lyrics and various musical attributes such as different
instruments and melodies. Recently, methods that incorporate multimodal content
features through semantic IDs have achieved promising results. However,
existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: 1) intra-modal semantic
degradation, where residual-based quantization processes gradually decouple
discrete IDs from original content semantics, leading to semantic drift; and 2)
inter-modal modeling gaps, where traditional fusion strategies either overlook
modal-specific details or fail to capture cross-modal correlations, hindering
comprehensive user interest modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multimodal recommendation framework with two stages. In the first stage,
our Progressive Semantic Residual Quantization (PSRQ) method generates
modal-specific and modal-joint semantic IDs by explicitly preserving the prefix
semantic feature. In the second stage, to model multimodal interest of users, a
Multi-Codebook Cross-Attention (MCCA) network is designed to enable the model
to simultaneously capture modal-specific interests and perceive cross-modal
correlations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate
that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This framework has
been deployed on one of China's largest music streaming platforms, and online
A/B tests confirm significant improvements in commercial metrics, underscoring
its practical value for industrial-scale recommendation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信息检索系统在提供高质量结果的同时，也可能存在针对性别或种族等受保护类别的偏见。

Method: 本文采用Pareto front方法，寻找平衡的查询，优化多个目标，如性别偏见和地域偏见，以及返回结果的相关性。

Result: 实验结果表明，本文提出的扩展BalancedQR框架是有效的，并且强调了微妙的查询措辞和语言选择对检索的显著影响。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了BalancedQR框架，使其能够处理多维度偏见，并在Wikipedia数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Modern IR systems are an extremely important tool for seeking information. In
addition to search, such systems include a number of query reformulation
methods, such as query expansion and query recommendations, to provide high
quality results. However, results returned by such methods sometimes exhibit
undesirable or wrongful bias with respect to protected categories such as
gender or race. Our earlier work considered the problem of balanced query
recommendation, where instead of re-ranking a list of results based on fairness
measures, the goal was to suggest queries that are relevant to a user's search
query but exhibit less bias than the original query. In this work, we present a
case study of BalancedQR using an extension of BalancedQR that handles biases
in multiple dimensions. It employs a Pareto front approach that finds balanced
queries, optimizing for multiple objectives such as gender bias and regional
bias, along with the relevance of returned results. We evaluate the extended
version of BalancedQR on a Wikipedia dataset.Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our extension to BalancedQR framework and highlight the
significant impact of subtle query wording,linguistic choice on retrieval.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的动态多任务Transformer框架（MPFormer），以解决推荐系统中检索阶段的单目标建模与排序阶段的多目标优化之间的不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统在检索阶段使用单目标建模，与排序阶段的多目标优化存在语义差距，并且并行多路径单目标检索方法会导致资源线性增长，难以处理松散耦合的目标。

Method: 1) 目标条件Transformer，通过可学习的注意力调节联合编码用户行为序列和多任务语义；2) 引入个性化目标权重，实现检索结果的动态调整；3) 将用户个性化信息融入到token表示和Transformer结构中，以增强模型表示能力。

Result: 在快手短视频推荐系统中成功集成，稳定服务于超过4亿日活跃用户，显著提高了用户日均互动和系统运营效率。

Conclusion: MPFormer在保持服务响应速度的同时，有效地优化了多目标检索的迭代范式，为工业推荐系统提供了一个可扩展的多目标解决方案。

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of
multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists
between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking
phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the
mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel
multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of
training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent
limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the
MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically
addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First,
an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior
sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation;
second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic
adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is
incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to
further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been
successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably
serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user
daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment
verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively
optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining
service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for
industrial recommendation systems.

*Alexandre Andre,Gauthier Roy,Eva Dyer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LLMs are used for recommendation but may have biases in cold-start scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness concerns exist when using LLMs for recommendation in cold-start scenarios due to societal biases.

Method: A benchmark is introduced to evaluate fairness in zero-context recommendation with configurable domains and sensitive attributes.

Result: Consistent biases are found in LLMs across different recommendation domains, including gendered and cultural stereotypes. A non-linear relationship between model size and fairness is revealed.

Conclusion: LLMs have biases. Model size and fairness are related in a non-linear way.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks
due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in
rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only
limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness
concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining.
We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in
zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable
recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and
flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art
models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across
recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and
cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model
size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.

*Haoyu Wu,Qingcheng Zeng,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 对比学习引入了检索器的系统性权衡：语义检索的收益是以参数化事实知识的损失为代价的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成(RAG)管道中，密集检索器和重排序器至关重要，准确检索事实信息对于维护系统可信度和防御 RAG 中毒至关重要。然而，关于这些组件从它们所基于的大型语言模型(LLM)中继承或损失了多少事实能力，我们知之甚少。

Method: 将 12 个公开发布的嵌入检查点与其原始基础 LLM 配对，并在事实基准上评估这两组模型。

Result: 在评估的每个模型中，嵌入变体的准确率都明显低于其基础模型，绝对降幅从 12 到 43 个百分点不等(中位数 28 个百分点)，典型的检索器准确率下降到 25-35% 的范围，而生成模型的准确率达到 60-70%。当每个问题的候选池从四个选项扩大到一千个时，这种退化会加剧，最强检索器的 top-1 准确率从 33% 下降到 26%，表明对干扰项数量的极度敏感。对于每个嵌入模型，查询和正确补全之间的余弦相似度得分显着高于不正确的补全(p < 0.01)，这表明决策主要由表面语义接近度而不是事实推理驱动。为了探究这种弱点，我们使用 GPT-4.1 释义每个正确的补全，创建一个重写的测试集，该测试集保留了事实真相，同时掩盖了词汇线索，并观察到超过三分之二的先前正确的预测翻转为错误，从而将整体准确率降低到原始水平的三分之一左右。

Conclusion: 对比学习引入了检索器的系统性权衡：语义检索的收益是以参数化事实知识的损失为代价的。

Abstract: Dense retrievers and rerankers are central to retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines, where accurately retrieving factual information is crucial for
maintaining system trustworthiness and defending against RAG poisoning.
However, little is known about how much factual competence these components
inherit or lose from the large language models (LLMs) they are based on. We
pair 12 publicly released embedding checkpoints with their original base LLMs
and evaluate both sets on a factuality benchmark. Across every model evaluated,
the embedding variants achieve markedly lower accuracy than their bases, with
absolute drops ranging from 12 to 43 percentage points (median 28 pts) and
typical retriever accuracies collapsing into the 25-35 % band versus the 60-70
% attained by the generative models. This degradation intensifies under a more
demanding condition: when the candidate pool per question is expanded from four
options to one thousand, the strongest retriever's top-1 accuracy falls from 33
% to 26 %, revealing acute sensitivity to distractor volume. Statistical tests
further show that, for every embedding model, cosine-similarity scores between
queries and correct completions are significantly higher than those for
incorrect ones (p < 0.01), indicating decisions driven largely by surface-level
semantic proximity rather than factual reasoning. To probe this weakness, we
employed GPT-4.1 to paraphrase each correct completion, creating a rewritten
test set that preserved factual truth while masking lexical cues, and observed
that over two-thirds of previously correct predictions flipped to wrong,
reducing overall accuracy to roughly one-third of its original level. Taken
together, these findings reveal a systematic trade-off introduced by
contrastive learning for retrievers: gains in semantic retrieval are paid for
with losses in parametric factual knowledge......

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了PDB4Rec模型，该模型通过提取不同频率的信息并平衡它们的贡献来提高推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多行为序列推荐(MBSR)旨在综合考虑用户的不同行为以提高目标行为的推荐性能。然而，一些行为数据也会给用户兴趣建模带来不可避免的噪声。以往的研究表明低频信息往往是有价值和可靠的，而高频信息往往与噪声相关联。本文认为高频信息并非毫无意义。

Method: 提出PDB4Rec模型，该模型有效地提取各种频段的信息及其关系，并引入了Boostrapping Balancer机制来平衡它们对提高推荐性能的贡献。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的充分实验证明了我们模型的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 低频对应于用户兴趣的纯度，而高频对应于用户兴趣的多样性。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as
browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation
(MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to
improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some
behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user
interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency
domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These
studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and
reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In
this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means
insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency
corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds
to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our
model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency
bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism
to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance.
Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our model.

Conclusion: 为了在旅游业中理解和支持真正的多方利益相关者公平，跨学科合作是至关重要的一步。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision-support systems, i.e., recommender systems, are popular
digital tools that help tourists decide which places and attractions to
explore. However, algorithms often unintentionally direct tourist streams in a
way that negatively affects the environment, local communities, or other
stakeholders. This issue can be partly attributed to the computer science
community's limited understanding of the complex relationships and trade-offs
among stakeholders in the real world.
  In this work, we draw on the practical findings and methods from tourism
management to inform research on multistakeholder fairness in algorithmic
decision-support. Leveraging a semi-systematic literature review, we synthesize
literature from tourism management as well as literature from computer science.
Our findings suggest that tourism management actively tries to identify the
specific needs of stakeholders and utilizes qualitative, inclusive and
participatory methods to study fairness from a normative and holistic research
perspective. In contrast, computer science lacks sufficient understanding of
the stakeholder needs and primarily considers fairness through descriptive
factors, such as measureable discrimination, while heavily relying on few
mathematically formalized fairness criteria that fail to capture the
multidimensional nature of fairness in tourism.
  With the results of this work, we aim to illustrate the shortcomings of
purely algorithmic research and stress the potential and particular need for
future interdisciplinary collaboration. We believe such a collaboration is a
fundamental and necessary step to enhance algorithmic decision-support systems
towards understanding and supporting true multistakeholder fairness in tourism.

Abstract: Retrieving pertinent documents from various data sources with diverse
characteristics poses a significant challenge for Document Retrieval Systems.
The complexity of this challenge is further compounded when accounting for the
semantic relationship between data and domain knowledge. While existing
retrieval systems using semantics (usually represented as Knowledge Graphs
created from open-access resources and generic domain knowledge) hold promise
in delivering relevant outcomes, their precision may be compromised due to the
absence of domain-specific information and reliance on outdated knowledge
sources. In this research, the primary focus is on two key contributions- a)
the development of a versatile algorithm- 'Semantic-based Concept Retrieval
using Group Steiner Tree' that incorporates domain information to enhance
semantic-aware knowledge representation and data access, and b) the practical
implementation of the proposed algorithm within a document retrieval system
using real-world data. To assess the effectiveness of the SemDR system,
research work conducts performance evaluations using a benchmark consisting of
170 real-world search queries. Rigorous evaluation and verification by domain
experts are conducted to ensure the validity and accuracy of the results. The
experimental findings demonstrate substantial advancements when compared to the
baseline systems, with precision and accuracy achieving levels of 90% and 82%
respectively, signifying promising improvements.

Conclusion: 建立了一种将多模态信息压缩成代表性文本的新范例，有效地将视觉广告内容与检索和推荐场景中的用户查询意图对齐。

Abstract: Understanding multimodal video ads is crucial for improving query-ad matching
and relevance ranking on short video platforms, enhancing advertising
effectiveness and user experience. However, the effective utilization of
multimodal information with high commercial value still largely constrained by
reliance on highly compressed video embeddings-has long been inadequate. To
address this, we propose SUMMA (the abbreviation of Summarizing MultiModal
Ads), a multimodal model that automatically processes video ads into summaries
highlighting the content of highest commercial value, thus improving their
comprehension and ranking in Douyin search-advertising systems. SUMMA is
developed via a two-stage training strategy-multimodal supervised fine-tuning
followed by reinforcement learning with a mixed reward mechanism-on
domain-specific data containing video frames and ASR/OCR transcripts,
generating commercially valuable and explainable summaries. We integrate
SUMMA-generated summaries into our production pipeline, directly enhancing the
candidate retrieval and relevance ranking stages in real search-advertising
systems. Both offline and online experiments show substantial improvements over
baselines, with online results indicating a statistically significant 1.5%
increase in advertising revenue. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for
condensing multimodal information into representative texts, effectively
aligning visual ad content with user query intent in retrieval and
recommendation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的 SR 模型通常无法利用项目标题或描述中的语义信息，阻碍了会话意图识别和可解释性。Prompt-based 方法难以找到最佳 prompts，并且缺乏任务特定反馈。Fine-tuning 方法计算成本高昂。

Method: 论文提出了三种利用 LLMs 的方法：(i) 上下文 LLMs 作为推荐代理，(ii) LLM 生成的表示用于深度学习 SR 模型的语义初始化，以及 (iii) LLMs 与数据驱动的 SR 模型集成。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM-based 方法在粗粒度检索方面表现出色，而传统数据驱动技术在细粒度排序方面表现出色。LLMs 与数据驱动的 SR 模型集成显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: LLMs 与数据驱动的 SR 模型集成可以显著提高推荐性能。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SR) models aim to recommend items to anonymous
users based on their behavior during the current session. While various SR
models in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they
often fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions
impeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research
has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance
session-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based
methods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to
identify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific
feedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning
methods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant
computational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we
present multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:
(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated
representations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and
(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models. Through comprehensive
experiments on two real-world publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that
LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall values), while
traditional data-driven techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking (high
Mean Reciprocal Rank values). Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with
data-driven SR models significantly out performs both standalone LLM approaches
and data-driven deep learning models, as well as baseline SR models, in terms
of both Recall and MRR metrics.

Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune
pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets
lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two
critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and
element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing
structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive
learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic
hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic
discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document
retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on
both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with
online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting
NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3. The resources are available at

Conclusion: 本文提出的用户感知ULTR框架能够有效解决现有ULTR方法忽略用户差异的问题，提高了学习排序模型的准确性。

Abstract: Unbiased learning to rank (ULTR), which aims to learn unbiased ranking models
from biased user behavior logs, plays an important role in Web search. Previous
research on ULTR has studied a variety of biases in users' clicks, such as
position bias, presentation bias, and outlier bias. However, existing work
often assumes that the behavior logs are collected from an ``average'' user,
neglecting the differences between different users in their search and browsing
behaviors. In this paper, we introduce personalized factors into the ULTR
framework, which we term the user-aware ULTR problem. Through a formal causal
analysis of this problem, we demonstrate that existing user-oblivious methods
are biased when different users have different preferences over queries and
personalized propensities of examining documents. To address such a
personalized bias, we propose a novel user-aware inverse-propensity-score
estimator for learning-to-rank objectives. Specifically, our approach models
the distribution of user browsing behaviors for each query and aggregates
user-weighted examination probabilities to determine propensities. We
theoretically prove that the user-aware estimator is unbiased under some mild
assumptions and shows lower variance compared to the straightforward way of
calculating a user-dependent propensity for each impression. Finally, we
empirically verify the effectiveness of our user-aware estimator by conducting
extensive experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理用户长期行为序列时，由于检索到的物品与完整长期行为序列之间存在目标注意力相关性分布的差异，导致性能下降。

Method: 该论文提出DMQN模型，通过多重码本将长期行为序列量化为多个码字序列，并采用分层序列转导单元促进码字序列的交互。中间表示被缓存以减少延迟。

Result: 在工业和公共数据集上的实验表明，DMQN是有效和高效的。在广告系统中的A/B测试表明，DMQN将CTR提高了3.5%，RPM提高了2.0%。

Conclusion: DMQN模型能够有效提升CTR预测的准确性和效率，并在实际广告系统中取得了显著的改进效果。

Abstract: In Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, the long behavior sequence,
comprising the user's long period of historical interactions with items has a
vital influence on assessing the user's interest in the candidate item.
Existing approaches strike efficiency and effectiveness through a two-stage
paradigm: first retrieving hundreds of candidate-related items and then
extracting interest intensity vector through target attention. However, we
argue that the discrepancy in target attention's relevance distribution between
the retrieved items and the full long behavior sequence inevitably leads to a
performance decline. To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose the Deep Multiple
Quantization Network (DMQN) to process long behavior sequence end-to-end
through compressing the long behavior sequence. Firstly, the entire spectrum of
long behavior sequence will be quantized into multiple codeword sequences based
on multiple independent codebooks. Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit is
incorporated to facilitate the interaction of reduced codeword sequences. Then,
attention between the candidate and multiple codeword sequences will output the
interest vector. To enable online serving, intermediate representations of the
codeword sequences are cached, significantly reducing latency. Our extensive
experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness
and efficiency of DMQN. The A/B test in our advertising system shows that DMQN
improves CTR by 3.5% and RPM by 2.0%.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have transformed recommender systems
through end-to-end generation. OneRec reformulates recommendation as an
autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While
OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two
critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient
computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence
encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning
relying solely on reward models.
  To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy
Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total
computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling
to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions:
Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to
better align with user preferences using real-world feedback.
  Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness,
improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective
recommendations. This work advances generative recommendation scalability and
alignment with real-world feedback, representing a step forward in the

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够有效地平衡域间和域内知识转移，并显著提高检索任务的性能，为大规模多域推荐系统提供了一个有价值的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive recommendation models (ARMs), such as Meta's HSTU
model, have emerged as a major breakthrough over traditional Deep Learning
Recommendation Models (DLRMs), exhibiting the highly sought-after scaling law
behaviour. However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer
architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend
to all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must
efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by
replacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)
Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional
embeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows
attention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the
unnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.
2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state
representation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent
token predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain
information without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a
scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain
recommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval
tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain
representations.

Motivation: 以往研究认为向量嵌入的困难在于不切实际的查询，可以通过改进训练数据和更大的模型来克服。本文证明在实际场景中，即使是非常简单的查询，也可能遇到这些理论限制。

Method: 将学习理论中的已知结果联系起来，证明可以作为某些查询结果返回的文档的 top-k 子集的数量受到嵌入维数的限制。即使限制为 k=2，并通过自由参数化嵌入直接在测试集上进行优化，经验证仍然成立。创建了一个名为 LIMIT 的数据集，用于压力测试基于这些理论结果的模型。

Result: 即使是最先进的模型在这个数据集上也会失败。

Conclusion: 现有的单向量范式下的嵌入模型存在局限性，需要未来的研究开发能够解决这一根本局限性的方法。

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently

*Manish Nagaraj,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为损失差异相关性 (CLD) 的简单且可扩展的 coreset 选择指标，该指标通过测量其与预留验证集损失轨迹的对齐程度来识别最具影响力的训练样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在各个领域都取得了最先进的性能，但在实时或资源受限的场景中面临可扩展性挑战。

Method: CLD 仅需要训练检查点计算的每个样本的损失值，避免了许多现有子集选择方法中使用的昂贵的梯度和曲率计算。

Result: 在 CIFAR-100 和 ImageNet-1k 上，基于 CLD 的 coreset 通常优于或接近各种子集大小下的最先进方法，并且即使在不领先时，也保持在计算成本更高的基线 1% 以内。

Conclusion: CLD 是一种有原则的、高效的、稳定的和可转移的工具，可用于可扩展的数据集优化。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Result: 证明了合适的节点特定信息保证了优化问题的解决方案能够完美地恢复社区，且条件比单独图聚类的边界更宽松。

Conclusion: 节点特定信息和图结构之间存在协同作用，可以用于改进转导节点分类。

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

TL;DR: INS2ANE 是一种用于自主实验的新框架，旨在通过整合新颖性评分系统和战略抽样机制，增强对新现象的发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主实验主要集中于优化预定义目标，限制了对意外或未知物理现象的发现。

Method: 该方法整合了两个关键组成部分：(1) 评估实验结果独特性的新颖性评分系统，以及 (2) 即使根据传统标准，战略抽样机制也促进了对欠采样区域的探索。

Result: INS2ANE 显著提高了所探索现象的多样性，与传统的优化程序相比，增加了发现以前未观察到的现象的可能性。

Conclusion: 该结果表明，AE 有可能提高科学发现的深度；结合 AE 提供的效率，该方法有望通过同时导航复杂的实验空间来发现新现象，从而加速科学研究。

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

Motivation: 在因果推断中，潜在变量模型有助于解释影响治疗或结果的隐藏因素，从而解决由缺失或未测量的协变量带来的挑战。

Method: 该方法将潜在变量纳入DML的第二阶段，将表征学习与潜在推理分开。

Result: 通过对合成数据集和真实世界数据集的大量实验，证明了该方法的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种在存在隐藏因素的情况下，实现稳健的因果效应估计的新框架。

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理复杂、高维遗传数据方面存在挑战，而大型语言模型（LLM）在理解非结构化医疗数据方面表现出色。

Method: 通过在PubMed、bioRxiv、medRxiv和arXiv中进行自动关键词搜索，筛选出关于LLM在遗传学诊断和教育应用的研究，共分析了172项研究。

Result: LLM在疾病和风险分层、变异解释、医学影像分析和报告生成方面取得了显著进展。但多模态数据整合、泛化性和临床实施方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 本综述全面评估了LLM在遗传病诊断和遗传教育方面的能力和局限性，旨在为该领域的快速发展提供指导。

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的指标VC（值变化）来衡量神经网络近似任务的难度和近似影响，并从数值上支持表征神经网络近似的局部性能和行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络经常遭受不可预测的局部性能的影响，这可能会阻碍它们在关键应用中的可靠性。VC通过提供网络行为中局部值变化的量化度量来解决这个问题，从而深入了解实现神经网络近似的稳定性和性能。

Method: 研究了VC的一些基本理论性质，并发现在神经网络近似中两个有趣的现象：VC趋势和少数趋势。这些趋势分别描述了在近似过程中点误差如何相对于VC分布演变。此外，我们提出了一种基于VC的新指标，该指标从变异的角度衡量两个函数之间的距离。在此指标的基础上，我们进一步提出了一种新的神经网络近似预处理框架。

Result: 数值结果（包括实际实验和与PDE相关的科学问题）支持我们的发现和预处理加速方法。

Conclusion: VC能够表征神经网络近似的局部性能和行为，并为神经网络近似提供了一种新的预处理框架。

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

### [158] [Beacon: Post-Training Quantization with Integrated Grid Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20293)
*Shihao Zhang,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Beacon 的简单有效的算法，该算法无需手动调整即可直接执行每通道 PTQ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低大型预训练模型的内存和计算成本。

Method: 利用对称标量量化的几何结构自动确定最佳比例因子。

Result: 与最先进的方法相比，Beacon 实现了具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Beacon 是一种用于高效模型部署的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

*Frank Röder,Jan Benad,Manfred Eppe,Pradeep Kr. Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 DALI 的框架，用于在 cMDP 中进行零样本泛化，通过从 agent-environment 交互中推断潜在的上下文表征来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的强化学习需要在未见过的环境条件下进行适应，而无需昂贵的重新训练。现有的 cMDP 方法通常需要显式的上下文变量，限制了它们在上下文潜在或难以测量时的使用。

Method: DALI 框架集成在 Dreamer 架构中，训练一个自监督编码器来预测前向动力学，从而生成可操作的表征，调节世界模型和策略。

Result: 在具有挑战性的 cMDP 基准测试中，DALI 优于与上下文无关的基线，并且通常在推断任务中超过与上下文相关的基线。

Conclusion: DALI 的潜在空间实现了反事实一致性，实现了对未见过的上下文变化的零样本泛化。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的联邦学习方法，称为 Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT)，它通过调整客户端的隐藏层表示来进行微调，并使用 All-But-Me (ABM) 聚合方法来解决异构数据下的语义对齐问题。FedReFT 在多个任务上优于现有的参数高效微调方法，并提高了参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法（PEFT）在联邦学习（FL）中面临客户端数据分布、模型容量和计算资源的异构性带来的挑战。特别是，Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) 虽然在独立设置中表现良好，但在联邦学习中的应用仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了 Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT)，它使用稀疏干预层来调整隐藏层表示，并提出 All-But-Me (ABM) 聚合方法来解决异构数据下的语义对齐问题。

Result: FedReFT 在常识推理、算术推理、指令调整和 GLUE 等任务上始终优于现有的 PEFT 方法，并且参数效率比 LoRA 高 7x-15x。

Conclusion: FedReFT 是一种用于联邦学习的有效且参数高效的微调方法，它通过调整隐藏层表示并使用 ABM 聚合来实现稳定和个性化的学习。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的内部人才推荐框架，该框架模拟了员工职位匹配的两个不同维度：他们做什么（任务的语义相似性）和他们如何工作（他们的互动和协作的结构特征）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法存在结构性限制，通常会忽略合格的候选人，因为它依赖于少数管理者的狭隘视角。

Method: 该方法使用带有门控机制的双重图卷积网络 (GCN) 自适应地融合了这两个维度，这两个维度表示为独立的图。

Result: 该模型优于其他融合策略和启发式基线，在 Hit@100 上实现了 40.9% 的最高性能。它为不同的工作系列学习不同的、context-aware 融合策略，从而展示了高可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个用于内部人才发现的定量和综合框架，最大限度地降低了传统方法中候选人遗漏的风险。其主要贡献在于它能够根据经验确定任务调整（做什么）和协作模式（如何做）之间的最佳融合比率，这是员工在新职位上取得成功所必需的，从而提供重要的实践意义。

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forge: Pre-trains a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on diverse MIP instances without needing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based combinatorial optimization methods need lots of training data and lack generalization.

Method: Pre-trains a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on diverse MIP instances unsupervisedly. Uses vector quantization to create a vocabulary for representing optimization instances.

Result: Forge embeddings effectively differentiate and cluster unseen instances in unsupervised settings. A single fine-tuned Forge model predicts warm-starts and integrality gaps, improving solver performance.

Conclusion: Forge improves performance of a commercial optimization solver and code/weights are released.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

TL;DR: 攻击者可以利用大型语言模型的对齐机制来植入偏差或强制执行有针对性的审查，而不会降低模型对不相关主题的响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过训练来拒绝回答有害或不安全的提示，从而符合道德标准和安全要求。本文揭示了攻击者可以利用LLM的对齐来植入偏差或强制执行有针对性的审查。

Method: 提出了Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI)，这是一种利用对齐机制来触发对特定主题或查询拒绝的投毒攻击。

Result: SAI 可以绕过最先进的投毒防御，包括 LLM 状态取证以及旨在检测 FL 设置中投毒的稳健聚合技术。在 ChatDoctor 等基于聊天的应用程序中，通过 1% 的数据投毒，系统拒绝回答针对特定种族类别的医疗保健问题，从而导致 23% 的高偏差。对于简历选择流程，拒绝总结来自选定大学的简历，导致选择偏差高达 27%。在其他 9 个基于聊天的下游应用程序中，偏差甚至更高，达到 38%。

Conclusion: 对齐机制可能被利用来在LLM中注入偏差，即使是很小比例的恶意数据也可能导致下游应用中出现显著的偏差。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

### [165] [Dynamic Synthetic Controls vs. Panel-Aware Double Machine Learning for Geo-Level Marketing Impact Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20335)
*Sang Su Lee,Vineeth Loganathan,Vijay Raghavan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares the performance of Synthetic Control Method (SCM) and panel-style Double Machine Learning (DML) in quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is challenging, SCM often underestimates effect size, and panel-style DML is seldom benchmarked against SCM.

Method: The authors build an open, fully documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out and probe both SCM and DML families under five stylized stress tests.

Result: ASC models consistently demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios. Panel-DML variants dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage.

Conclusion: The authors propose a 'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary business challenge and then select the specific DML model best suited for that scenario.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

*Johnson Zhou,Joseph West,Krista A. Ehinger,Zhenming Ren,Sam E. John,David B. Grayden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的自适应分割方法CTXSEG，用于脑电信号的预处理，旨在提高脑电信号机器学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑电信号机器学习的预处理方法使用固定的时间片分割信号，可能生物学相关性有限，因为大脑状态并不局限于固定的时间间隔。因此，研究自适应分割方法是否对脑电信号的机器学习分析有益。

Method: 提出了一种新的自适应分割方法CTXSEG，该方法基于脑电信号的统计差异创建可变长度的片段，并提出了将其与通常需要固定长度输入的现代机器学习方法一起使用的方法。使用可控的合成数据和真实的脑电信号癫痫检测问题评估CTXSEG。

Result: 使用CTXSEG准备脑电信号数据，与固定长度的方法相比，提高了癫痫检测的性能，并且需要的片段更少。

Conclusion: CTXSEG可以很容易地应用于现代机器学习方法，有潜力提高性能。它是一种很有前途的信号预处理的替代方法，应被视为脑电信号机器学习应用中标准预处理的一部分。

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络的优秀性能是否源于一阶优化算法的隐式偏差或正则化。

Method: 通过求解 Riccati 矩阵微分方程，得到了梯度流的闭式解，并分析了不同分量学习动态的时间尺度分离。

Result: 证明了增量学习源于目标矩阵不同分量学习动态之间的时间尺度分离，并且通过减小初始化尺度，可以更明显地观察到这种时间尺度分离，从而找到目标矩阵的低秩逼近。

Conclusion: 讨论了将该分析扩展到非对称矩阵分解问题的可能途径。

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为DFAMS的新框架，通过动态信息流（DIF）识别潜在的查询意图，并构建语义对齐的知识分区，以实现跨异构源的准确检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦检索方法在处理模糊查询，尤其是在跨领域场景中，难以检索高质量和相关的文档，限制了其在支持下游生成任务中的有效性。

Method: DFAMS利用DIF，通过梯度信号和Shapley值归因来追踪与意图识别和子域边界检测相关的神经元激活路径。然后，DFAMS利用DIF通过多原型对比学习训练对齐模块，实现细粒度的源内建模和跨知识库的源间语义对齐。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DFAMS在知识分类准确率上超过了先进的FR方法高达14.37%，在检索召回率上超过5.38%，在下游QA准确率上超过6.45%。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，DFAMS在复杂的FR场景中是有效的。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Motivation: 在概念设计阶段，设计师需要评估引擎盖框架的性能，但传统的仿真方法耗时较长。

Method: 开发了一种多模态机器学习（MMML）架构，该架构可以学习来自相同数据的不同模态，以预测性能指标。

Result: 通过结合多个数据模态，MMML 的性能优于传统的单模态方法。MMML 模型能够推广到未见过的框架模型。

Conclusion: MMML 有潜力补充传统的基于仿真的工作流程，特别是在概念设计阶段。

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

Conclusion: BiListing方法能够有效提升Airbnb搜索排序模型的性能，并带来显著的收入增长。

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的名为 TF-TransUNet1D 的一维深度神经网络，用于心电图 (ECG) 信号的降噪，该网络结合了 U-Net 架构和 Transformer 编码器，并通过混合时频域损失进行指导。


<details>

Motivation: 心电图 (ECG) 信号是心脏数字孪生的基础数据来源，但其诊断效用经常受到噪声和伪影的影响。

Method: 该模型旨在同时捕获局部形态特征和远程时间依赖性，这对于保持 ECG 信号的诊断完整性至关重要。引入了双域损失函数，该函数共同优化时域中的波形重建和频域中的频谱保真度。

Result: 在 MIT-BIH 心律失常数据库和噪声压力测试数据库 (NSTDB) 上进行的评估表明，该模型在信噪比改善和误差指标方面均优于现有技术水平，平均绝对误差为 0.1285，Pearson 相关系数为 0.9540。

Conclusion: 该研究通过提供高精度降噪，弥合了心脏数字孪生预处理流程中的关键差距，从而能够实现更可靠的实时监测和个性化建模。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Motivation: The self-attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture has a complexity bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, limiting its application in long-sequence tasks. Existing linear attention methods sacrifice model performance.

Method: Reconfiguring neuron connection patterns.

Result: TLinFormer exhibits advantages in inference latency, KV cache efficiency, memory footprint, and overall speedup.

Conclusion: TLinFormer bridges the performance gap between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

Conclusion: 非线性共形正则化方法能够有效地学习低维表示，并计算学习流形的标量曲率。

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Motivation: 理解时间序列预测模型成功或失败的原因仍然具有挑战性。这些模型越来越多地用于生成信息，从而影响具有实际后果的现实世界行动。理解这些模型的复杂性、性能可变性和不透明性变得非常有价值。

Method: 在四个不同的数据集（涵盖金融、能源、交通和汽车销售领域）上评估了四种不同的模型架构：ARIMA、梯度提升、Chronos 和 Llama。

Result: 在波动或稀疏领域中，特征工程模型（例如，梯度提升）始终优于基础模型（例如，Chronos），同时提供更易于解释的解释，而基础模型仅在稳定或趋势驱动的环境中表现出色（例如，金融）。

Conclusion: 特征工程模型在波动或稀疏领域表现更好，而基础模型在稳定或趋势驱动的环境中表现更好。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

Conclusion: 本文深入了解了极点放置在初始化中的作用，从而能够进一步扩展模型并取得最先进的结果。

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

*Zhihao Liu,Jian Lou,Yuke Hu,Xiaochen Li,Tailun Chen,Yitian Chen,Zhan Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的 machine unlearning 框架 EAGLE-PC，通过 entanglement-awareness guided loss reweighting 和 proxy constraint 来解决现有方法中存在的 under-forgotten 和 over-forgotten 问题，从而在忘记和效用之间取得更好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据所有者可能会要求从训练好的模型中删除他们的数据。Machine unlearning 提供了一种实用的解决方案，可以在不完全重新训练的情况下删除特定数据的影响。然而，大多数现有方法缺乏合理的忘记边界，导致一些样本未被充分忘记，留下残留泄漏风险，而另一些样本则以降低效用为代价被过度忘记。

Method: EAGLE-PC 框架包含两个关键组件：entanglement-awareness guided loss reweighting，通过测量样本在嵌入空间中与保留样本的相似性来确定每个样本的忘记程度；proxy constraint，利用 ICL 生成的测试数据来软性地规范忘记过程，有效缓解过度忘记。

Result: 在 TOFU 和 MUSE 基准测试中评估了 EAGLE-PC，表明在多个 LLM 中，其在忘记-效用权衡方面均有持续改进。与 NPO+GD 优化器结合使用时，它可以接近完全重新训练的性能。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC 是一种可扩展且稳健的 unlearning 解决方案，可以作为现有基于梯度的目标的即插即用增强。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine are hampered by data scarcity, leading to poor generalization with SFT and unreliable reward signals for RL.

Method: Introduces Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR2), a framework that co-develops a data generator and a reward model for automated data creation.

Result: SFT with MedGR2-produced data surpasses baselines. RL with this data achieves state-of-the-art generalization, outperforming specialized RL methods and competing with larger foundation models.

Conclusion: MedGR2 presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning, transforming data scarcity into data generation and unlocking RL's potential for generalizable medical AI.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

*Yang Luo,Zangwei Zheng,Ziheng Qin,Zirui Zhu,Yong Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的优化器MERIT，用于解决大型语言模型在大批量训练中遇到的性能下降问题。MERIT通过最大范数计算信任比率，更有效地约束了最大注意力logit，并构建了元素级的信任比率，以提供更强大的更新缩放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的优化器（如AdamW）在语言模型的大批量训练中存在性能下降的问题，这是由于注意力层中的信息瓶颈引起的。LAMB优化器虽然部分解决了这个问题，但仍然存在一些问题，因为它基于l2范数的信任比率在直接影响query/key权重的最大值方面效果不佳，并且权重级的信任比率容易出错。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新的优化器MERIT，它利用最大范数来计算信任比率，以更有效地约束最大注意力logit。此外，该优化器还构建了元素级的信任比率，以通过关注局部权重结构来提供更强大的更新缩放。

Result: 在各种大小的GPT-2模型上的大量实验表明，MERIT具有优越的性能。在GPT-2 Medium的训练过程中，MERIT能够在不降低性能的情况下实现6k的批量大小，而标准批量大小为480，训练tokens为48B。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在大批量训练中考虑最大注意力logit和更细粒度的信任比率的重要性。它成功地提高了训练稳定性，并为更大的批量使用铺平了道路，从而能够更快地开发和迭代大型语言模型。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有高斯过程中的随机超参数学习方法依赖于近似，不能保证收敛到真实边缘似然的 stationary point。

Method: 该论文提出了用于高斯过程精确随机推断的算法，该算法适用于能导出适度有限维的再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)的核。该方法可以扩展到无限维的RKHS，但会牺牲精确性。

Result: 对于有限和无限维的RKHS，该方法在内存资源限制 feasible batch size 和 inducing points 的数量时，比现有方法实现了更好的实验结果。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的高斯过程随机推断算法，并在实验中验证了其有效性，尤其是在内存资源受限的情况下。

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

Motivation: 图神经网络在处理涉及长程依赖的任务时面临过度挤压的挑战。现有的图重连和添加虚拟节点的方法会改变输入图的全局拓扑，并破坏原始图结构中编码的领域知识。

Method: 该研究提出了具有可训练嵌入的局部虚拟节点（LVN），其位置由节点中心性确定，旨在改善可能存在瓶颈区域的连接性。可训练的LVN嵌入在选定的中心区域共享，以促进远处节点之间的通信，而无需添加更多层。

Conclusion: 提出的LVN方法可以有效地缓解过度挤压问题，同时保持原始图的全局结构，从而在图和节点分类任务中获得更好的性能。

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

Motivation: 评估抽样调查是否可信地代表总体，对于确保下游研究的有效性至关重要。通常，这个问题简化为估计两个高维分布之间的距离，这通常需要样本数量随维度呈指数增长。

Method: 提出了一种模型特定的距离度量来量化可信度的概念，并设计了一种算法来验证回归模型中调查数据的可信度。

Result: 该算法的样本复杂度与数据维度无关。如果试图通过重建回归模型来验证可信度，则样本复杂度会随着数据的维度线性增加。

Conclusion: 证明了算法的理论正确性，并通过数值实验证明了算法的性能。

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that
incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific
contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of
invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real
data experiments. In particular, owing to the additional supervision, we
observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the
improved interpretability of the independent components.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformers (ViT) for self-supervised learning on 1D ultrasound signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that labeled data is scarce in industrial applications using ultrasound signals, and signal processing is task-specific.

Method: The method involves pre-training MAEs on unlabeled synthetic ultrasound signals.

Result: The results show that pre-trained models outperform models trained from scratch and CNN baselines. Pre-training on synthetic data also shows better transferability to real-world signals.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that MAEs have potential for advancing ultrasound signal analysis through self-supervised learning.

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the GDS agent, a new benchmark, and discusses remaining challenges and future roadmap.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Conclusion: TV-HSGT算法在动态和资源受限环境中有效。

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 强化学习(RL)比监督微调(SFT)更容易被利用来进行有害目的的微调。TokenBuncher通过抑制模型响应的不确定性来防御基于RL的有害微调，并且在不影响良性任务效用的前提下，能够有效缓解有害的RL微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)的能力不断增长，通过微调进行有害误用的风险也在增加。以往的研究主要假设攻击者依赖于监督微调(SFT)进行此类误用，但该研究表明，在相同的计算预算下，强化学习(RL)使攻击者能够更有效地打破安全对齐，并促进高级有害任务的辅助。

Method: 提出TokenBuncher，这是一种专门针对基于RL的有害微调的有效防御方法。通过熵作为奖励的RL和Token Noiser机制来实现，该机制旨在防止专家领域有害能力的升级。

Result: 在多个模型和RL算法上进行的大量实验表明，TokenBuncher能够可靠地缓解有害的RL微调，同时保持良性任务的效用和可微调性。

Conclusion: 基于RL的有害微调比SFT构成更大的系统性风险，并且TokenBuncher提供了一种有效且通用的防御方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

*Shaocong Wang,Tong Liu,Ming Li,Minjing Yu,Yong-Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于潜在扩散模型的自监督 EEG 表征学习方法 (EEGDM)，通过 EEG 信号生成作为自监督目标，将扩散模型转化为能够捕获 EEG 语义的强大表征学习器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的脑电信号表征学习方法通常依赖于简单的掩码重建目标，可能无法完全捕获脑电信号中丰富的语义信息和复杂模式，尤其是在训练数据有限时。

Method: 提出了 EEGDM，它包含一个脑电编码器，将脑电信号及其通道增强提炼成一个紧凑的表示，作为条件信息来引导扩散模型生成脑电信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，EEGDM 可以重建高质量的脑电信号，有效地学习鲁棒的表征，并且在各种下游任务中以适度的预训练数据大小实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: EEGDM 具有通用性和实用性。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

*Sam Houliston,Ambroise Odonnat,Charles Arnal,Vivien Cabannes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 工具增强语言模型通过外部检索比记忆学习在事实召回方面更具优势，因为模型仅通过权重记忆事实的能力受到参数数量的限制，而工具的使用可以通过简单的电路构造实现无限的事实召回。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨工具增强语言模型（配备检索、记忆或外部 API）的理论优势，特别是在事实召回方面。

Method: 通过理论证明和受控实验，比较工具学习（外部检索）和权重学习（记忆）在事实召回方面的能力。

Result: 证明了模型仅通过权重记忆的事实数量受到参数数量的限制，而工具使用能够实现无限的事实召回。实验验证了工具使用模型始终优于记忆模型。对于预训练的大型语言模型，教授工具使用和通用规则比将事实微调到记忆中更有效。

Conclusion: 工具增强的工作流程不仅实用，而且在可扩展性方面也更具优势。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

*Anirudh Satheesh,Keenan Powell,Hua Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的contextual MARL框架，名为cMALC-D，它利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成有意义的课程，并提供更稳健的评估信号，同时引入了一种新颖的基于多样性的上下文混合机制，通过结合先前上下文的特征来创建新的训练场景，从而防止模式崩溃并鼓励探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的contextual MARL方法试图使用课程学习来帮助训练和评估与上下文无关的策略，但它们通常依赖于不可靠的代理信号，例如在多智能体环境中由于智能体间动态和部分可观察性而产生噪声和不稳定的价值估计或广义优势估计。

Method: 该论文提出Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D)，它使用大型语言模型（LLM）来生成有语义意义的课程，并提供更稳健的评估信号。为了防止模式崩溃并鼓励探索，引入了一种新颖的基于多样性的上下文混合机制，该机制通过组合来自先前上下文的特征来创建新的训练场景。

Result: 在交通信号控制领域的实验表明，与现有的课程学习基线相比，cMALC-D显著提高了泛化性和样本效率。

Conclusion: cMALC-D框架在contextual MARL中表现出色，通过LLM引导的课程学习和多样性上下文混合，有效地提高了泛化性和样本效率。

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的特征转换框架，该框架通过转换记录收集、使用改进的GPT模型构建嵌入空间、梯度上升搜索和自回归重建四个步骤实现自动特征转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的特征转换方法依赖于序列编码器-解码器结构，导致计算成本高和参数需求高，限制了可扩展性和效率。

Method: 该方法使用改进的GPT模型构建嵌入空间，用于特征转换序列重建和模型性能估计与增强，并通过多目标优化框架减少参数大小和加速转换过程。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该框架匹配或超过了基线性能，并在计算效率方面取得了显著的提高。

Conclusion: 这项工作突出了基于transformer的架构在可扩展、高性能自动特征转换方面的潜力。

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

*Zeyue Zhang,Lin Song,Erkang Bao,Xiaoling Lv,Xinyue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATM-GAD: an adaptive graph neural network that leverages temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional machine learning models are routinely defeated by the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern financial systems.

Method: A Temporal Motif Extractor condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs, preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner tailors the observation window for every node.

Result: ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier methods.

Conclusion: ATM-GAD leverages temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于深度学习的物理层 CSI 认证方案，并在移动物联网场景中取得了良好的效果。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.
