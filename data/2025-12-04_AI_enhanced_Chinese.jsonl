Existing RAG approaches often focus on general documents, and they overlook the fact that many real-world documents (such as books, booklets, handbooks, etc.) have a hierarchical structure, which organizes their content from different granularity levels, leading to poor performance for the QA task. To address these limitations, we introduce BookRAG, a novel RAG approach targeted for documents with a hierarchical structure, which exploits logical hierarchies and traces entity relations to query the highly relevant information. Specifically, we build a novel index structure, called BookIndex, by extracting a hierarchical tree from the document, which serves as the role of its table of contents, using a graph to capture the intricate relationships between entities, and mapping entities to tree nodes. Leveraging the BookIndex, we then propose an agent-based query method inspired by the Information Foraging Theory, which dynamically classifies queries and employs a tailored retrieval workflow. Extensive experiments on three widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that BookRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baselines in both retrieval recall and QA accuracy while maintaining competitive efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "BookRAG\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6587\u6863\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u67e5\u8be2\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6587\u6863\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4QA\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u540d\u4e3aBookIndex\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5c42\u6b21\u6811\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f53\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6811\u8282\u70b9\u3002\u5229\u7528BookIndex\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4fe1\u606f\u89c5\u98df\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u91cf\u8eab\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBookRAG\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cQA\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u7740\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "BookRAG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6587\u6863\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u67e5\u8be2\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cQA\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u7740\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Traditional recommendation systems often lack explainability and suffer from issues such as popularity bias. Previous research has also indicated that LLMs, when used as standalone predictors, fail to achieve accuracy comparable to traditional models. To address these challenges, we propose to use LLM as an explainable re-ranker, a hybrid approach that combines traditional recommendation models with LLMs to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. We constructed a dataset to train the re-ranker LLM and evaluated the alignment between the generated dataset and human expectations. Leveraging a two-stage training process, our model significantly improved NDCG, a key ranking metric. Moreover, the re-ranker outperformed a zero-shot baseline in ranking accuracy and interpretability.

We validate this capability on 22 typologically diverse languages, demonstrating consistent performance and adaptability across linguistic and script variations.

Building a system that can automatically do that would have sounded like science fiction just a few years ago. Yet, with the extraordinary progress in LLMs and agentic AI, this is now within reach. Still, there remains a striking gap between what is technically possible and what is being demonstrated by recent work. Most existing verification systems operate only on small, single-table databases$\\unicode{x2014}$typically a few hundred rows$\\unicode{x2014}$that conveniently fit within an LLM's context window.\n  In this paper we report our progress on Thucy, the first cross-database, cross-table multi-agent claim verification system that also provides concrete evidence for each verification verdict. Thucy remains completely agnostic to the underlying data sources before deployment and must therefore autonomously discover, inspect, and reason over all available relational databases to verify claims. Importantly, Thucy also reports the exact SQL queries that support its verdict (whether the claim is accurate or not) offering full transparency to expert users familiar with SQL. When evaluated on the TabFact dataset$\\unicode{x2014}$the standard benchmark for fact verification over structured data$\\unicode{x2014}$Thucy surpasses the previous state of the art by 5.6 percentage points in accuracy (94.3% vs. 88.7%).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aThucy\u7684\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3001\u8de8\u8868\u683c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u5176\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u76f8\u4e0e\u8c0e\u8a00\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u3001\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u4eba\u7269\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u58f0\u660e\u539f\u5219\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u5355\u8868\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u3001\u591a\u8868\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3002", "method": "Thucy\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u652f\u6301\u5176\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5728TabFact\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cThucy\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6c34\u5e73\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e865.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0894.3% vs. 88.7%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Thucy\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3001\u8de8\u8868\u683c\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

In materials science, ML has primarily supported large-scale discovery of novel compounds using first-principles data and digital twin applications for optimizing manufacturing processes. However, applying general-purpose ML frameworks to complex industrial materials such as steel remains a challenge. A key obstacle is accurately capturing the intricate relationship between chemical composition, processing parameters, and the resulting microstructure and properties. To address this, we introduce a computational framework that combines physical insights with ML to develop a physics-informed continuous cooling transformation (CCT) model for steels. Our model, trained on a dataset of 4,100 diagrams, is validated against literature and experimental data. It demonstrates high computational efficiency, generating complete CCT diagrams with 100 cooling curves in under 5 seconds. It also shows strong generalizability across alloy steels, achieving phase classification F1 scores above 88% for all phases. For phase transition temperature regression, it attains mean absolute errors (MAE) below 20 \u00b0C across all phases except bainite, which shows a slightly higher MAE of 27 \u00b0C. This framework can be extended with additional generic and customized ML models to establish a universal digital twin platform for heat treatment. Integration with complementary simulation tools and targeted experiments will further support accelerated materials design workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u94a2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u8fde\u7eed\u51b7\u5374\u8f6c\u53d8 (CCT) \u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u578b\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u6750\u6599\uff08\u5982\u94a2\uff09\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u969c\u788d\u662f\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u5316\u5b66\u6210\u5206\u3001\u52a0\u5de5\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u9519\u7efc\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5305\u542b 4,100 \u4e2a\u56fe\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u6587\u732e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u5728 5 \u79d2\u5185\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b 100 \u6761\u51b7\u5374\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u5b8c\u6574 CCT \u56fe\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u5728\u5408\u91d1\u94a2\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u7684\u76f8\u5206\u7c7b F1 \u5206\u6570\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e 88%\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u76f8\u53d8\u6e29\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u9664\u8d1d\u6c0f\u4f53\u5916\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee (MAE) \u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e 20 \u00b0C\uff0c\u8d1d\u6c0f\u4f53\u7684 MAE \u7a0d\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e3a 27 \u00b0C\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u989d\u5916\u7684\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5b9a\u5236 ML \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u7528\u4e8e\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u4e0e\u4e92\u8865\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u96c6\u6210\u5c06\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u652f\u6301\u52a0\u901f\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Building on a recent Second Law of Intelligence that treats ethical entropy as a state variable which tends to increase unless countered by alignment work, we make this framework operational for large language models. We define a five-way behavioral taxonomy, train a classifier to estimate ethical entropy S(t) from model transcripts, and measure entropy dynamics for base and instruction-tuned variants of four frontier models across stress tests. Base models show sustained entropy growth, while tuned variants suppress drift and reduce ethical entropy by roughly eighty percent.

This requires fundamentally different learning paradigms from pixel-based visual models. Symbolic visual learners parse diagrams into geometric primitives-points, lines, and shapes-whereas pixel-based learners operate on textures and colors. We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency. Since vanilla reinforcement learning exhibits poor exploration in the policy space during diagram reconstruction; we thus introduce stabilization mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. We fine-tune our symbolic encoder on downstream tasks, developing a neuro-symbolic system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic models through reasoning-grounded visual rewards. Evaluations across reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: achieving a 98.2% reduction in MSE for geometric diagram reconstruction, surpassing GPT-4o by 0.6% with a 7B model on chart reconstruction, and improving by +13% on the MathGlance perception benchmark, and by +3% on MathVerse and GeoQA reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7b26\u53f7\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u56fe\u8868\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u5143\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u5f15\u64ce\u89e3\u7801\u5b83\u4eec\u4ee5\u91cd\u5efa\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u8868\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u6765\u8868\u793a\u56fe\u8868\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u4f8b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u5c42\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b83\u5e94\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u70b9\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u7ebf\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u7a33\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u91cd\u5efa\u7684 MSE \u65b9\u9762\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86 98.2%\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8fc7 GPT-4o 0.6%\uff08\u4f7f\u7528 7B \u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5728 MathGlance \u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 +13%\uff0c\u5728 MathVerse \u548c GeoQA \u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 +3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027"}}

Second, I propose syntropy -- the recursive reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment -- as an information-theoretic framework for understanding multi-agent alignment dynamics. Third, I establish a functional distinction between genuine and simulated moral capacity grounded in compatibilist theories of guidance control, coupled with an embodied experimental paradigm and verification regime providing operational criteria independent of phenomenological claims. This paper represents the philosophical component of a broader research program whose empirical validation is being developed in a separate project currently in preparation.

Despite the prevalence of this behavior, a significant disconnect persists between mainstream e-commerce search engines and users' comparison needs. Traditional ranking models often evaluate items in isolation, disregarding the context in which users compare multiple items on a search results page. While recent advances in deep learning have sought to improve ranking accuracy, diversity, and fairness by encoding listwise context, the challenge of aligning search rankings with user comparison shopping behavior remains inadequately addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking architecture - Learning-to-Comparison-Shop (LTCS) System - that explicitly models and learns users' comparison shopping behaviors. Through extensive offline and online experiments, we demonstrate that our approach yields statistically significant gains in key business metrics - improving NDCG by 1.7% and boosting booking conversion rate by 0.6% in A/B testing - while also enhancing user experience.

In response, watermarks have been added to the text embeddings to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers by allowing them to check for model ownership. This thesis focuses on defending against imitation attacks by investigating EaaS watermarks. To achieve this goal, we unveil novel attacks and propose and validate new watermarking techniques.\n  Firstly, we show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed through paraphrasing the input text when attackers clone the model during imitation attacks. Our study illustrates that paraphrasing can effectively bypass current state-of-the-art EaaS watermarks across various attack setups (including different paraphrasing techniques and models) and datasets in most instances. This demonstrates a new vulnerability in recent EaaS watermarking techniques.\n  Subsequently, as a countermeasure, we propose a novel watermarking technique, WET (Watermarking EaaS with Linear Transformation), which employs linear transformation of the embeddings. Watermark verification is conducted by applying a reverse transformation and comparing the similarity between recovered and original embeddings. We demonstrate its robustness against paraphrasing attacks with near-perfect verifiability. We conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the significance of each component and hyperparameter in WET.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u5373\u670d\u52a1\uff08EaaS\uff09\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u590d\u8ff0\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672fWET\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u590d\u8ff0\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "EaaS\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6a21\u4eff\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u62a4EaaS\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u3002", "method": "1. \u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709EaaS\u6c34\u5370\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u8ff0\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u6765\u79fb\u9664\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\n2. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672fWET\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u91c7\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "1. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u590d\u8ff0\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684EaaS\u6c34\u5370\u3002\n2. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86WET\u5bf9\u590d\u8ff0\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709EaaS\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672fWET\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6a21\u4eff\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a unified framework based on the concept of a \"drainage node'' which we add at the output of the network. The node serves to reallocate probability mass toward uncertainty, while preserving desirable properties such as end-to-end training and differentiability. This mechanism provides a natural escape route for highly ambiguous, anomalous, or noisy samples, particularly relevant for instance-dependent and asymmetric label noise. In systematic experiments involving the addition of varying proportions of instance-dependent noise or asymmetric noise to CIFAR-10/100 labels, our drainage formulation achieves an accuracy increase of up to 9\\% over existing approaches in the high-noise regime. Our results on real-world datasets, such as mini-WebVision, mini-ImageNet and Clothing-1M, match or surpass existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative analysis reveals a denoising effect, where the drainage neuron consistently absorbs corrupt, mislabeled, or outlier data, leading to more stable decision boundaries.

If n datasets must serve m environments, up to n*m replicas can emerge, increasing inconsistency and cost. Traditional warehouses copy data into vendor-specific stores; cross-platform access is hard. This study proposes the Enterprise Data Science Platform (EDSP), which builds on data lakehouse architecture and follows a Write-Once, Read-Anywhere principle. EDSP enables federated data access for multi-query engine environments, targeting data science workloads with periodic data updates and query response times ranging from seconds to minutes. By providing centralized data management with federated access from multiple query engines to the same data sources, EDSP eliminates data duplication and vendor lock-in inherent in traditional data warehouses. The platform employs a four-layer architecture: Data Preparation, Data Store, Access Interface, and Query Engines. This design enforces separation of concerns and reduces the need for data migration when integrating additional analytical environments. Experimental results demonstrate that major cloud data warehouses and programming environments can directly query EDSP-managed datasets. We implemented and deployed EDSP in production, confirming interoperability across multiple query engines. For data sharing across different analytical environments, EDSP achieves a 33-44% reduction in operational steps compared with conventional approaches requiring data migration. Although query latency may increase by up to a factor of 2.6 compared with native tables, end-to-end completion times remain on the order of seconds, maintaining practical performance for analytical use cases.

However, the significant resource requirements of FL often exclude centres with limited computational infrastructure, further widening existing healthcare disparities. To address this issue, we propose a Green AI-oriented adaptive layer-freezing strategy designed to reduce energy consumption and computational load while maintaining model performance. We tested our approach using different federated architectures for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-to-Computed Tomography (CT) conversion. The proposed adaptive strategy optimises the federated training by selectively freezing the encoder weights based on the monitored relative difference of the encoder weights from round to round. A patience-based mechanism ensures that freezing only occurs when updates remain consistently minimal. The energy consumption and CO2eq emissions of the federation were tracked using the CodeCarbon library. Compared to equivalent non-frozen counterparts, our approach reduced training time, total energy consumption and CO2eq emissions by up to 23%. At the same time, the MRI-to-CT conversion performance was maintained, with only small variations in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Notably, for three out of the five evaluated architectures, no statistically significant differences were observed, while two architectures exhibited statistically significant improvements. Our work aligns with a research paradigm that promotes DL-based frameworks meeting clinical requirements while ensuring climatic, social, and economic sustainability.

While existing debiasing approaches primarily target demographic and social biases, methods for addressing cognitive biases in LLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first solution to address CSB through Reasoning Dependency Generation (RDG), a novel framework for generating unbiased reasoning data to mitigate choice-supportive bias through fine-tuning. RDG automatically constructs balanced reasoning QA pairs, explicitly (un)modeling the dependencies between choices, evidences, and justifications. Our approach is able to generate a large-scale dataset of QA pairs across domains, incorporating Contextual Dependency Data and Dependency Decouple Data. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on RDG-generated data demonstrate a 81.5% improvement in memory-based experiments and 94.3% improvement in the evaluation-based experiment, while maintaining similar performance on standard BBQ benchmarks.

We investigate whether targeted, AI-driven, head-pose correction and image restoration can improve recognition accuracy.

However, this paradigm might incur substantial token overhead, especially when models \"overthink\" by producing lengthy reasoning chains, which can even lead to incorrect answers. A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks.

While 3D coronary artery digital twins reconstructed from imaging offer detailed anatomy for personalized assessment, their analysis relies on computationally intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD), limiting scalability. Data-driven approaches are hindered by scarce labeled data and lack of physiological priors. To address this, we present PINS-CAD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework. It pre-trains graph neural networks on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins to predict pressure and flow, guided by 1D Navier-Stokes equations and pressure-drop laws, eliminating the need for CFD or labeled data. When fine-tuned on clinical data from 635 patients in the multicenter FAME2 study, PINS-CAD predicts future cardiovascular events with an AUC of 0.73, outperforming clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines. This demonstrates that physics-informed pretraining boosts sample efficiency and yields physiologically meaningful representations. Furthermore, PINS-CAD generates spatially resolved pressure and fractional flow reserve curves, providing interpretable biomarkers.

Project page: https://waabi.ai/flux4d/", "summary": "Reconstructing large-scale dynamic scenes from visual observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with critical implications for robotics and autonomous systems. While recent differentiable rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved impressive photorealistic reconstruction, they suffer from scalability limitations and require annotations to decouple actor motion. Existing self-supervised methods attempt to eliminate explicit annotations by leveraging motion cues and geometric priors, yet they remain constrained by per-scene optimization and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we introduce Flux4D, a simple and scalable framework for 4D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic scenes. Flux4D directly predicts 3D Gaussians and their motion dynamics to reconstruct sensor observations in a fully unsupervised manner. By adopting only photometric losses and enforcing an \"as static as possible\" regularization, Flux4D learns to decompose dynamic elements directly from raw data without requiring pre-trained supervised models or foundational priors simply by training across many scenes. Our approach enables efficient reconstruction of dynamic scenes within seconds, scales effectively to large datasets, and generalizes well to unseen environments, including rare and unknown objects. Experiments on outdoor driving datasets show Flux4D significantly outperforms existing methods in scalability, generalization, and reconstruction quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFlux4D\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u76844D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u5373\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b3D\u9ad8\u65af\u53ca\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u91ca\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u6f14\u5458\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5149\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u201c\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u9759\u6001\u201d\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b3D\u9ad8\u65af\u53ca\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "Flux4D\u5728\u51e0\u79d2\u949f\u5185\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u770b\u4e0d\u89c1\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "Flux4D\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u6307\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u5b9a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406agent\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u786c\u76ee\u6807/\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6709/\u65e0\u76ee\u6807\u5851\u9020\uff09\u4e0bagent\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u76ee\u6807\u5851\u9020\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u6807\u5851\u9020\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5373\uff0c\u5b83\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5229\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5373\uff0c\u5b83\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\u3002"}}

However, these adaptation components are tightly coupled to a specific base model, making them difficult to reuse when the base model is upgraded (e.g., from SD 1.x to 2.x) due to substantial changes in model parameters and architecture. In this work, we propose Delta Sampling (DS), a novel method that enables knowledge transfer across base models with different architectures, without requiring access to the original training data. DS operates entirely at inference time by leveraging the delta: the difference in model predictions before and after the adaptation of a base model. This delta is then used to guide the denoising process of a new base model. We evaluate DS across various SD versions, demonstrating that DS achieves consistent improvements in creating desired effects (e.g., visual styles, semantic concepts, and structures) under different sampling strategies. These results highlight DS as an effective, plug-and-play mechanism for knowledge transfer in diffusion-based image synthesis.

Many Text2KG methods, however, rely on iterative LLM prompting, making them computationally expensive and prone to overlooking complex relations distributed throughout the text. To address these limitations, we propose InvertiTune, a framework that combines a controlled data generation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Within this framework, the data-generation pipeline systematically extracts subgraphs from large knowledge bases, applies noise filtering, and leverages LLMs to generate corresponding natural text descriptions, a task more aligned with LLM capabilities than direct KG generation from text. This pipeline enables generating datasets composed of longer texts paired with larger KGs that better reflect real-world scenarios compared to existing benchmarks, thus supporting effective SFT of lightweight models for single-shot KG construction. Experimental results on CE12k, a dataset generated using the introduced pipeline, show that InvertiTune outperforms larger non-fine-tuned LLMs as well as state-of-the-art Text2KG approaches, while also demonstrating stronger cross-dataset generalization on CrossEval-1200, a test set created from three established benchmark datasets and CE12k.

In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems.

To this end, we analyze the dynamical system governing the continuous-time limit of the pre-trained model and characterize the asymptotic behavior of its solutions. Specifically, we characterize when tokens move closer to or farther from one another over time, depending on the model parameters. We provide sufficient conditions, based on these parameters, to identify scenarios where tokens either converge to zero or diverge to infinity. Unlike prior works, our conditions are broader in scope and more applicable to real-world models. Furthermore, we investigate how different forms of positional encoding -- specifically absolute and rotary -- affect these dynamical regimes. Empirical evidence reveals that the convergence scenario adversely impacts model performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose simple refinements to Transformer architectures that mitigate convergence behavior in models with absolute or rotary positional encoding. These findings support theoretical foundations and design principles for improving Transformer models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dtoken\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6539\u8fdbTransformer\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6781\u9650\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u63cf\u8ff0\u5176\u89e3\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0token\u4f55\u65f6\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u6216\u66f4\u8fdc\u79bb\u5f7c\u6b64\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8bc6\u522btoken\u6536\u655b\u5230\u96f6\u6216\u53d1\u6563\u5230\u65e0\u7a77\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6536\u655b\u60c5\u666f\u4f1a\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u5177\u6709\u7edd\u5bf9\u6216\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

We introduce a two-stage large language model (LLM) based method for inferring material composition directly from 3D point clouds with coarse segmentations. Our key insight is to decouple reasoning about what an object is from what it is made of. In the first stage, an LLM predicts the object's semantic; in the second stage, it assigns plausible materials to each geometric segment, conditioned on the inferred semantics. Both stages operate in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific training.

Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a Argos \u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30 agent \u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8 agent \u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5956\u52b1\u9677\u9631\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5608\u6742\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e Agent \u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236 Argos\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u4e00\u7ec4\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6d3e\u751f\u7684\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u7ec8\u54cd\u5e94\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6240\u5f15\u7528\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 SFT \u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u548c RL \u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5229\u7528 Argos\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ee5\u53ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u5177\u8eab\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a agentic \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6574\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c SFT \u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u4e0d\u591f\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cagent \u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u4f1a\u5728 RL \u671f\u95f4\u5d29\u6e83\u4e3a\u65e0\u6839\u636e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5 Agent \u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8fd8\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11 MMRL \u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u9677\u9631\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7 Pareto \u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e3a Argos \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, optimizing EB charging schedules to minimize operational costs while ensuring safe operation without battery depletion remains challenging - especially under real-world conditions, where uncertainties in PV generation, dynamic electricity prices, variable travel times, and limited charging infrastructure must be accounted for. In this paper, we propose a safe Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) framework for solving the EB Charging Scheduling Problem (EBCSP) under multi-source uncertainties. We formulate the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with options to enable temporally abstract decision-making.

At the high level, we adopt a centralized PPO-Lagrangian algorithm to learn safe charger allocation policies. At the low level, we incorporate MAPPO-Lagrangian to learn decentralized charging power decisions under the Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm.

We present MaxTER, a Pareto-optimal evaluation framework for assessing privacy-utility tradeoffs, and show the performance of RMFT vs Deduplication by Area Under The Response Curve (AURC) metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11PII\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u5fae\u8c03\uff08RMFT\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u603b\u63d0\u53d6\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8680.81%\uff0c\u53ef\u89c1\u63d0\u53d6\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8680.17%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u91cd\u590d\u6570\u636e\u5220\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u4e865.73%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MaxTER\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u79c1\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u54cd\u5e94\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\uff08AURC\uff09\u6307\u6807\u5c55\u793a\u4e86RMFT\u4e0e\u91cd\u590d\u6570\u636e\u5220\u9664\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Learning-based denoisers have the potential to reconstruct high-quality images. For training, however, these denoisers require large paired datasets of clean and noisy images, which are difficult to collect. Noise synthesis is an alternative to large-scale data acquisition: given a clean image, we can synthesize a realistic noisy counterpart. In this work, we propose a general and practical noise synthesis method that requires only one single noisy image and one single dark frame per ISO setting. We represent signal-dependent noise with a Poisson distribution and introduce a Fourier-domain spectral sampling algorithm to accurately model signal-independent noise. The latter generates diverse noise realizations that maintain the spatial and statistical properties of real sensor noise. As opposed to competing approaches, our method neither relies on simplified parametric models nor on large sets of clean-noisy image pairs. Our synthesis method is not only accurate and practical, it also leads to state-of-the-art performances on multiple low-light denoising benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5355\u5f20\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5355\u5f20\u6697\u5e27\u5373\u53ef\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u5149\u964d\u566a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u566a\u58f0\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u964d\u566a\u5668\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u6536\u96c6\u3002\u566a\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u662f\u5927\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6cca\u677e\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u793a\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u8c31\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u4fe1\u53f7\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5e72\u51c0-\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u5149\u964d\u566a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5355\u5f20\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5355\u5f20\u6697\u5e27\uff0c\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u5149\u964d\u566a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, in most real-world scenarios, lossy communication is a prevalent issue. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication, due to their limited scalability and robustness, struggles to apply to complex and dynamic real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose a generalized communication-constrained model to uniformly characterize communication conditions across different scenarios. Based on this, we utilize it as a learning prior to distinguish between lossy and lossless messages for specific scenarios. Additionally, we decouple the impact of lossy and lossless messages on distributed decision-making, drawing on a dual mutual information estimatior, and introduce a communication-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, quantifying the impact of communication messages into the global reward. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach across several communication-constrained benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6709\u635f\u901a\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u6709\u635f\u548c\u65e0\u635f\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u8026\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u91cd\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u6d88\u606f\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

However, the inherent latent compression often introduces pixel-level inconsistencies, such as chromatic shifts, texture mismatches, and visible seams along editing boundaries.

We introduce PixPerfect, a pixel-level refinement framework that delivers seamless, high-fidelity local edits across diverse LDM architectures and tasks. PixPerfect leverages (i) a differentiable discriminative pixel space that amplifies and suppresses subtle color and texture discrepancies, (ii) a comprehensive artifact simulation pipeline that exposes the refiner to realistic local editing artifacts during training, and (iii) a direct pixel-space refinement scheme that ensures broad applicability across diverse latent representations and tasks.

This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustain progress without human intervention. We evaluate PARC across computational science and data science tasks. In materials science, it autonomously reproduces key results from studies on lithium-ion conduction and alloy segregation. In particular, it coordinates dozens of parallel simulation tasks, each requiring roughly 43 hours of computation, managing orchestration, monitoring, and error correction end-to-end. In Kaggle-based experiments, starting from minimal natural-language instructions, PARC conducts data analysis and implements search strategies, producing solutions competitive with human-engineered baselines.

Using data from NASA's MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER), which is similar to a next-generation fire detection sensor, we compare accuracy, inference latency, and resource efficiency.\n  Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage pipeline achieves strong trade-offs between speed and accuracy, demonstrating significant potential for real-time edge deployment in future wildfire monitoring missions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u91ce\u706b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u8f7d\u548c\u661f\u8f7d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u706b\u707e\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u706b\u707e\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u673a\u8f7d\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u673a\u8f7d\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7c7b\u706b\u707e\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u8fd8\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPyroFocus\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8be5\u7ba1\u9053\u6267\u884c\u706b\u707e\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u706b\u707e\u8f90\u5c04\u529f\u7387\uff08FRP\uff09\u56de\u5f52\u6216\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u673a\u8f7d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u91ce\u706b\u76d1\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u91ce\u706b\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u673a\u8f7d\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains. Furthermore we establish the enhanced robustness and stability of our approach across different model scales, paving the way for effective and deployable agentic solutions for enterprises.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5RP-ReAct\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f01\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3bAgent\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3bAgent\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5355\u7247\u8ba1\u5212-\u6267\u884c\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u5bf9\u672c\u5730\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5feb\u901f\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RP-ReAct\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7ea7\u6267\u884c\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u5b83\u7531\u4e00\u4e2aReasoner Planner Agent (RPA)\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2aProxy-Execution Agent (PEA)\u7ec4\u6210\u3002RPA\u8d1f\u8d23\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0cPEA\u8d1f\u8d23\u5c06\u5b50\u6b65\u9aa4\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002PEA\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fdd\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u6309\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u5927\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728ToolQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRP-ReAct\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RP-ReAct\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684Agent\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While scaling model size mitigates this \\citep{brown2020language}, the fundamental myopia of the NTP objective remains. In this work, we introduce the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture that separates semantic planning from syntactic generation. We introduce an auxiliary ``Idea Head'' trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution for a future context window, creating a latent ``Concept Vector'' that actively gates the main vocabulary during generation. We propose a differentiable gating mechanism that suppresses semantically irrelevant tokens, effectively pruning the search space in real-time. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that while the Idea-Gated model achieves comparable validation perplexity to a standard GPT-2 baseline, it exhibits significantly superior Domain Retention. Qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals that the gating mechanism successfully locks generation into specific semantic clusters (e.g., Finance, Science) and resists associative drift, offering a parameter-efficient path toward more controllable language modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a Idea-Gated Transformer \u7684\u65b0\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u201c\u4e3b\u9898\u6f02\u79fb\u201d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u5173\u8054\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u9898\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46 Next-Token Prediction (NTP) \u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd Idea-Gated Transformer\uff0c\u5b83\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5b83\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u201cIdea Head\u201d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u8bcd\u888b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u201c\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u201d\uff0c\u8be5\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4e3b\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5fae\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6291\u5236\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684token\u3002", "result": "\u5728 WikiText-103 \u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIdea-Gated \u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6 GPT-2 \u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u9501\u5b9a\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7c07\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u62b5\u6297\u5173\u8054\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "Idea-Gated Transformer \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), most current approaches still rely on forward reasoning paradigms, generating step-by-step rationales from premises to conclusions. However, such methods often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift, resulting in inefficient and unreliable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR). The core idea is to integrate confidence-aware symbolic translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning. In the translation phase, only high-confidence spans are converted into logical form, such as First-Order Logic (FOL), while uncertain content remains in natural language. A translation reflection module further ensures semantic fidelity by evaluating symbolic outputs and reverting lossy ones back to text when necessary.

Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints.\n  Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search. We validate the framework in real retail environments achieving higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility.

However, the standard first-order attention mechanism is often limited by a low-rank bottleneck, struggling to capture intricate, multi-hop relationships within a single layer. In this paper, we propose the \\textbf{Higher-Order Attention Network (Hon)}, a novel architecture designed to enhance representational power through a recursive framework. Unlike standard approaches that use static linear projections for Queries and Keys, Hon dynamically refines these representations via nested self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, the Query and Key vectors are themselves outputs of inner attention loops, allowing tokens to aggregate global context and model high-order correlations \\textit{prior} to the final attention computation. We enforce a parameter-efficient weight-sharing strategy across recursive steps, ensuring that this enhanced expressivity incurs $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional parameters. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our method breaks the linear bottleneck of standard attention.

MemVerse maintains short-term memory for recent context while transforming raw multimodal experiences into structured long-term memories organized as hierarchical knowledge graphs. This design supports continual consolidation, adaptive forgetting, and bounded memory growth.

Traditionally, EF estimation requires manual tracing and domain expertise, making the process time-consuming and subject to interobserver variability. Most current deep learning methods for EF prediction are black-box models with limited transparency, which reduces clinical trust. Some post-hoc explainability methods have been proposed to interpret the decision-making process after the prediction is made. However, these explanations do not guide the model's internal reasoning and therefore offer limited reliability in clinical applications. To address this, we introduce ProtoEFNet, a novel video-based prototype learning model for continuous EF regression. The model learns dynamic spatiotemporal prototypes that capture clinically meaningful cardiac motion patterns. Additionally, the proposed Prototype Angular Separation (PAS) loss enforces discriminative representations across the continuous EF spectrum. Our experiments on the EchonetDynamic dataset show that ProtoEFNet can achieve accuracy on par with its non-interpretable counterpart while providing clinically relevant insight. The ablation study shows that the proposed loss boosts performance with a 2% increase in F1 score from 77.67$\\pm$2.68 to 79.64$\\pm$2.10.

RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings.

However, their application raises significant fairness concerns, as GNNs can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases against protected groups defined by sensitive attributes such as race or gender. These biases are often inherent in the node features, structural topology, and message-passing mechanisms of the graph itself. A critical limitation of existing fairness-aware GNN methods is their reliance on the strong assumption that sensitive attributes are fully available for all nodes during training--a condition that poses a practical impediment due to privacy concerns and data collection constraints. To address this gap, we propose a novel, model-agnostic fairness regularization framework designed for the realistic scenario where sensitive attributes are only partially available. Our approach formalizes a fairness-aware objective function that integrates both equal opportunity and statistical parity as differentiable regularization terms. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation across five real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates bias across key fairness metrics while maintaining competitive node classification performance. Results show that our framework consistently outperforms baseline models in achieving a favorable fairness-accuracy trade-off, with minimal degradation in predictive accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a novel method called Dual LoRA to improve the performance by incorporating an inductive bias into the original LoRA. Specifically, we separate low-rank matrices into two groups: the magnitude group to control whether or not and how far we should update a parameter and the direction group to decide whether this parameter should move forward or backward, to better simulate the parameter updating process of the full fine-tuning based on gradient-based optimization algorithms. We show that this can be simply achieved by adding a ReLU function to the magnitude group and a sign function to the direction group.

Alexander"], "title": "HalluGen: Synthesizing Realistic and Controllable Hallucinations for Evaluating Image Restoration", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative models are prone to hallucinations: plausible but incorrect structures absent in the ground truth. This issue is problematic in image restoration for safety-critical domains such as medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, where such errors undermine reliability and trust. For example, in low-field MRI, widely used in resource-limited settings, restoration models are essential for enhancing low-quality scans, yet hallucinations can lead to serious diagnostic errors. Progress has been hindered by a circular dependency: evaluating hallucinations requires labeled data, yet such labels are costly and subjective. We introduce HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes realistic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity, producing perceptually realistic but semantically incorrect outputs (segmentation IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36). Using HalluGen, we construct the first large-scale hallucination dataset comprising 4,350 annotated images derived from 1,450 brain MR images for low-field enhancement, enabling systematic evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation. We demonstrate its utility in two applications: (1) benchmarking image quality metrics and developing Semantic Hallucination Assessment via Feature Evaluation (SHAFE), a feature-based metric with soft-attention pooling that improves hallucination sensitivity over traditional metrics; and (2) training reference-free hallucination detectors that generalize to real restoration failures.

To address this limitation, we propose Omni-AutoThink, a novel adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the model's reasoning depth according to task difficulty. Our framework comprises two stages: (1) an Adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (Adaptive SFT) stage, which endows the Omni model with fundamental reasoning capability using large-scale reasoning-augmented data, and (2) an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive GRPO) stage, which optimizes reasoning behaviors based on task complexity and reward feedback. We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment.

In this work, our aim is to interpret its structure for Flow Matching (FM). FM learns a velocity field that transports samples from a simple source distribution to data by integrating an ODE. In rectified FM, training pairs are obtained by linearly interpolating between a source sample and a data sample, and a neural velocity field is trained to predict the straight line displacement using a mean squared error loss. This squared loss collapses all velocity targets that reach the same space-time point into a single conditional mean, thereby ignoring higher order conditional information (variance, skewness, multi-modality) that encodes fine geometric structure about the data manifold and minority branches. We apply the standard risk-sensitive (log-exponential) transform to the conditional FM loss and show that the resulting tilted risk loss is a natural upper-bound on a meaningful conditional entropic FM objective defined at each space-time point. Furthermore, we show that a small order expansion of the gradient of this conditional entropic objective yields two interpretable first order corrections: covariance preconditioning of the FM residual, and a skew tail term that favors asymmetric or rare branches. On synthetic data designed to probe ambiguity and tails, the resulting risk-sensitive loss improves statistical metrics and recovers geometric structure more faithfully than standard rectified FM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u503e\u659c\u98ce\u9669\u5728Flow Matching (FM) \u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a00\u6709\u6216\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u5728Flow Matching\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u504f\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\uff08\u5bf9\u6570\u6307\u6570\uff09\u53d8\u6362\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6FM\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u503e\u659c\u98ce\u9669\u635f\u5931\u662f\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5FM\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u4e0a\u754c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5c0f\u9636\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u504f\u5ea6\u5c3e\u9879\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6rectified FM\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u503e\u659c\u98ce\u9669\u635f\u5931\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6539\u8fdbFlow Matching\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7a00\u6709\u5206\u652f\u3002"}}

PretrainZero features the following characteristics: 1) Active pretraining: inspired by the active learning ability of humans, PretrainZero learns a unified reasoning policy to actively identify reasonable and informative contents from pretraining corpus, and reason to predict these contents by RL. 2) Self-supervised learning: without any verifiable labels, pretrained reward models, or supervised fine-tuning, we directly pretrain reasoners from 3 to 30B base models on the general Wikipedia corpus using RL, significantly breaking the verification data-wall for general reasoning. 3) Verification scaling: by tackling increasingly challenging masked spans, PretrainZero substantially enhances the general reasoning abilities of pretrained base models. In reinforcement pretraining, PretrainZero improves Qwen3-4B-Base for 8.43, 5.96 and 10.60 on MMLU-Pro, SuperGPQA and math average benchmarks.

We demonstrate that hierarchical attention models offer a superior and more parameter-efficient inductive bias, surpassing the performance of both 2D and 3D CNNs and ViTs. Our results show 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity in the sparse anomaly (subclinical) regime. Mechanistic analyses reveal that this advantage stems from precise spatial scale alignment: hierarchical windowing produces effective receptive fields matched to the intermediate, multi-slice extent of subclinical abnormalities. This avoids excessive CNN locality and diffuse global attention. Attention-distance measurements confirm a key insight into architectural adaptation: the required spatial integration length shifts significantly based on the signal strength, with subclinical cases necessitating longer integration compared to both healthy and manifest disease states. Representational similarity and auxiliary age/sex prediction tasks further support the generalizability of these inductive principles. The findings provide design guidance for future volumetric anomaly detection systems, establishing hierarchical attention as a principled and effective approach for early pathological change analysis in 3D medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u4f53\u79ef\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5fae\u5f31\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f8316\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\uff08SKC\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76842D/3D CNN\u548cViT\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65e9\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e8616\u79cd\u6db5\u76d62D/3D\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u4f53\u79efTransformer\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece3D\u773c\u524d\u8282OCT\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e2D/3D CNN\u548cViT\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5f02\u5e38\uff08\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\uff09\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\uff0c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8621-23%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86CNN\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u662f3D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u65e9\u671f\u75c5\u7406\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score.

While prior work has primarily focused on ensuring compliance, our approach considers scenarios where deviating from policies may be necessary to achieve high-stakes goals. Additionally, modeling non-compliant behavior can assist policymakers by simulating realistic human decision-making. Our framework extends Gelfond and Lobo's Authorization and Obligation Policy Language (AOPL) to incorporate penalties and integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning. Compared to previous approaches, our method ensures well-formed policies, accounts for policy priorities, and enhances explainability by explicitly identifying rule violations and their consequences. Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties. Experiments in two domains demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality plans that avoid harmful actions while, in some cases, also improving computational efficiency. These findings underscore its potential for enhancing autonomous decision-making and informing policy refinement.

Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct.

Computed tomography (CT) scans are widely used for lung cancer diagnosis as they can give detailed lung structures. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming and prone to human error. To surmount this challenge, the study proposes a deep learning-based automatic lung cancer classification system to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. The IQOTHNCCD lung cancer dataset is utilized, which is a public CT scan dataset consisting of cases categorized into Normal, Benign, and Malignant and used DenseNet169, which includes Squeezeand-Excitation blocks for attention-based feature extraction, Focal Loss for handling class imbalance, and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature fusion. In addition, an SVM model was developed using MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, improving its classification performance. For model interpretability enhancement, the study integrated Grad-CAM for the visualization of decision-making regions in CT scans and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for explanation of feature contributions within the SVM model. Intensive evaluation was performed, and it was found that both DenseNet169 and SVM models achieved 98% accuracy, suggesting their robustness for real-world medical practice.

We propose ECLIPSE, a framework that treats hallucination as a mismatch between a model's semantic entropy and the capacity of available evidence.

We prove that under mild conditions, the resulting entropy-capacity objective is strictly convex with a unique stable optimum. We evaluate on a controlled financial question answering dataset with GPT-3.5-turbo (n=200 balanced samples with synthetic hallucinations), where ECLIPSE achieves ROC AUC of 0.89 and average precision of 0.90, substantially outperforming a semantic entropy-only baseline (AUC 0.50). A controlled ablation with Claude-3-Haiku, which lacks token-level log probabilities, shows AUC dropping to 0.59 with coefficient magnitudes decreasing by 95% - demonstrating that ECLIPSE is a logprob-native mechanism whose effectiveness depends on calibrated token-level uncertainties. The perplexity decomposition features exhibit the largest learned coefficients, confirming that evidence utilization is central to hallucination detection.

We develop INDI-PROP, the first ideologically grounded fine-grained narrative dataset with multi-level annotation for analyzing propaganda in Indian news media. Our dataset INDI-PROP comprises 1,266 articles focusing on two polarizing socio-political events in recent times: CAA and the Farmers' protest. Each article is annotated at three hierarchical levels: (i) ideological article-bias (pro-government, pro-opposition, neutral), (ii) event-specific fine-grained narrative frames anchored in ideological polarity and communicative intent, and (iii) persuasive techniques. We propose FANTA and TPTC, two GPT-4o-mini guided multi-hop prompt-based reasoning frameworks for the bias, narrative, and persuasive technique classification. FANTA leverages multi-layered communicative phenomena by integrating information extraction and contextual framing for hierarchical reasoning.

However, existing research predominantly focuses on coarse spatiotemporal scales and relies on low-resolution satellite data, capturing only macroscopic fire states while fundamentally constraining high-precision localized fire dynamics modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present FireSentry, a provincial-scale multi-modal wildfire dataset characterized by sub-meter spatial and sub-second temporal resolution. Collected using synchronized UAV platforms, FireSentry provides visible and infrared video streams, in-situ environmental measurements, and manually validated fire masks. Building on FireSentry, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing physics-based, data-driven, and generative models, revealing the limitations of existing mask-only approaches. Our analysis proposes FiReDiff, a novel dual-modality paradigm that first predicts future video sequences in the infrared modality, and then precisely segments fire masks in the mask modality based on the generated dynamics.

To evaluate the success of their trajectories, researchers have developed verifiers, such as LLM judges and process-reward models, to score the quality of each action in an agent's trajectory. Although these heuristic scores can be informative, there are no guarantees of correctness when used to decide whether an agent will yield a successful output. Here, we introduce e-valuator, a method to convert any black-box verifier score into a decision rule with provable control of false alarm rates. We frame the problem of distinguishing successful trajectories (that is, a sequence of actions that will lead to a correct response to the user's prompt) and unsuccessful trajectories as a sequential hypothesis testing problem. E-valuator builds on tools from e-processes to develop a sequential hypothesis test that remains statistically valid at every step of an agent's trajectory, enabling online monitoring of agents over arbitrarily long sequences of actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that e-valuator provides greater statistical power and better false alarm rate control than other strategies across six datasets and three agents. We additionally show that e-valuator can be used for to quickly terminate problematic trajectories and save tokens. Together, e-valuator provides a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that converts verifier heuristics into decisions rules with statistical guarantees, enabling the deployment of more reliable agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86e-valuator\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u9ed1\u76d2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5206\u6570\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9agent\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u8b66\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff08\u5982LLM judges\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u6570\u4e0d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1agent\u4ea7\u751f\u6210\u529f\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u533a\u5206\u6210\u529f\u548c\u4e0d\u6210\u529f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e8f\u8d2f\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528e-processes\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u5728agent\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u90fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2aagent\u4e0a\uff0ce-valuator\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8b66\u62a5\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u7ec8\u6b62\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u8282\u7701token\u3002", "conclusion": "e-valuator\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684agent\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

First, the canonical Shapley framework assumes that the worth function is additive, yet real-world payoff constructions--driven by non-Gaussian distributions, heavy tails, feature dependence, or domain-specific loss scales--often violate this assumption, leading to distorted attributions. Secondly, achieving sparse explanations in high dimensions by computing dense Shapley values and then applying ad hoc thresholding is prohibitively costly and risks inconsistency. We introduce Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR), a unified nonlinear explanation framework. SISR simultaneously learns a monotonic transformation to restore additivity--obviating the need for a closed-form specification--and enforces an L0 sparsity constraint on the Shapley vector, enhancing computational efficiency in large feature spaces. Its optimization algorithm leverages Pool-Adjacent-Violators for efficient isotonic regression and normalized hard-thresholding for support selection, yielding implementation ease and global convergence guarantees. Analysis shows that SISR recovers the true transformation in a wide range of scenarios and achieves strong support recovery even in high noise. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate that irrelevant features and inter-feature dependencies can induce a true payoff transformation that deviates substantially from linearity. Experiments in regression, logistic regression, and tree ensembles demonstrate that SISR stabilizes attributions across payoff schemes, correctly filters irrelevant features while standard Shapley values suffer severe rank and sign distortions. By unifying nonlinear transformation estimation with sparsity pursuit, SISR advances the frontier of nonlinear explainability, providing a theoretically grounded and practical attribution framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u7b49\u6e17 Shapley \u56de\u5f52 (SISR)\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u6765\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c L0 \u7a00\u758f\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 Shapley \u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe worth \u51fd\u6570\u662f\u53ef\u52a0\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u91cd\u5c3e\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u635f\u5931\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u7ecf\u5e38\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f52\u56e0\u5931\u771f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5f88\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "SISR \u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9 Shapley \u5411\u91cf\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c L0 \u7a00\u758f\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528 Pool-Adjacent-Violators \u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b49\u6e17\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u786c\u9608\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u652f\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cSISR \u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u652f\u6301\u6062\u590d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSISR \u53ef\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u6536\u76ca\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u6b63\u786e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6389\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "SISR \u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While these tools hold societal promise, they also risk widening digital divides due to uneven adoption and low awareness of their limitations. This study presents the first comprehensive empirical mapping of GenAI adoption, usage patterns, and literacy in Italy, based on newly collected survey data from 1,906 Italian-speaking adults. Our findings reveal widespread adoption for both work and personal use, including sensitive tasks like emotional support and medical advice. Crucially, GenAI is supplanting other technologies to become a primary information source: this trend persists despite low user digital literacy, posing a risk as users struggle to recognize errors or misinformation. Moreover, we identify a significant gender divide -- particularly pronounced in older generations -- where women are half as likely to adopt GenAI and use it less frequently than men. While we find literacy to be a key predictor of adoption, it only partially explains this disparity, suggesting that other barriers are at play. Overall, our data provide granular insights into the multipurpose usage of GenAI, highlighting the dual need for targeted educational initiatives and further investigation into the underlying barriers to equitable participation that competence alone cannot explain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528GenAI\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u5b57\u7d20\u517b\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8GenAI\u5728\u610f\u5927\u5229\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u9e3f\u6c9f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf91906\u540d\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "result": "GenAI\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u7528\u9014\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u6570\u5b57\u7d20\u517b\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8c03\u67e5GenAI\u516c\u5e73\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u969c\u788d\u3002"}}

However, the substantial modality gap between optical and SAR images poses a major challenge for robust identification. To address this issue, we propose MOS, a novel framework designed to mitigate the optical-SAR modality gap and achieve modality-consistent feature learning for optical-SAR cross-modal ship ReID. MOS consists of two core components: (1) Modality-Consistent Representation Learning (MCRL) applies denoise SAR image procession and a class-wise modality alignment loss to align intra-identity feature distributions across modalities. (2) Cross-modal Data Generation and Feature fusion (CDGF) leverages a brownian bridge diffusion model to synthesize cross-modal samples, which are subsequently fused with original features during inference to enhance alignment and discriminability. Extensive experiments on the HOSS ReID dataset demonstrate that MOS significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation protocols, achieving notable improvements of +3.0%, +6.2%, and +16.4% in R1 accuracy under the ALL to ALL, Optical to SAR, and SAR to Optical settings, respectively.

Featuring multiple engineering objectives, Hydro-SE is an inherently interdisciplinary domain that integrates scientific knowledge with engineering expertise. This integration necessitates extensive expert collaboration in decision-making, which poses difficulties for intelligence. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their potential application in the Hydro-SE domain is being increasingly explored. However, the knowledge and application abilities of LLMs in Hydro-SE have not been sufficiently evaluated. To address this issue, we propose the Hydro-SE LLM evaluation benchmark (Hydro-SE Bench), which contains 4,000 multiple-choice questions. Hydro-SE Bench covers nine subfields and enables evaluation of LLMs in aspects of basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application ability, and reasoning and calculation ability. The evaluation results on Hydro-SE Bench show that the accuracy values vary among 0.74 to 0.80 for commercial LLMs, and among 0.41 to 0.68 for small-parameter LLMs. While LLMs perform well in subfields closely related to natural and physical sciences, they struggle with domain-specific knowledge such as industry standards and hydraulic structures. Model scaling mainly improves reasoning and calculation abilities, but there is still great potential for LLMs to better handle problems in practical engineering application. This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for Hydro-SE tasks, providing model developers with clear training targets and Hydro-SE researchers with practical guidance for applying LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6c34\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b(Hydro-SE)\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6(Hydro-SE Bench)\uff0c\u5305\u542b4000\u9053\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e5d\u4e2a\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728Hydro-SE\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9LLM\u5728Hydro-SE\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b4000\u9053\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u7684Hydro-SE Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e5d\u4e2a\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6982\u5ff5\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5546\u4e1aLLM\u5728Hydro-SE Bench\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u57280.74\u52300.80\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570LLM\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u57280.41\u52300.68\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002LLM\u5728\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7269\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6c34\u5de5\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u7b49\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e3b\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86LLM\u5728Hydro-SE\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u52a3\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aHydro-SE\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e94\u7528LLM\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

While prior work on Image Difference Captioning (IDC) has enabled models to describe semantic changes between static images, these approaches fail to capture motion continuity, event evolution, or editing consistency over time. We introduce the ViDiC (Video Difference Captioning) task and its corresponding ViDiC-1K dataset, designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to provide fine-grained descriptions of similarities and differences between video pairs. ViDiC-1K comprises 1,000 curated video pairs annotated with over 4,000 comparative checklist items, covering seven categories: subject, style, background, cinematography, motion, location, and playback techniques. To ensure reliable evaluation, we propose a dual-checklist framework that measures the accuracy of similarity and difference separately, based on the LLM-as-a-Judge protocol. Experiments on nineteen representative multimodal models reveal a significant performance gap in their comparative description and difference perception abilities.

We present an integrated SHM framework that combines principal component analysis (PCA), a Bayesian neural network (BNN), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference, mapping sparse strain gauge measurements onto leading PCA modes to reconstruct full-field strain distributions with uncertainty quantification. The framework was validated through cyclic four-point bending tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with varying crack lengths, achieving accurate strain field reconstruction (R squared value > 0.9) while simultaneously producing real-time uncertainty fields. A key contribution is that the BNN yields robust full-field strain reconstructions from noisy experimental data with crack-induced strain singularities, while also providing explicit representations of two complementary uncertainty fields. Considered jointly in full-field form, the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty fields make it possible to diagnose at a local level, whether low-confidence regions are driven by data-inherent issues or by model-related limitations, thereby supporting reliable decision-making.

We investigate whether different syntactic phenomena recruit shared or distinct components in LLMs. Using a functional localization approach inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we identify the LLM units most responsive to 67 English syntactic phenomena in seven open-weight models. These units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support the models' syntactic performance. Critically, different types of syntactic agreement (e.g., subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units, suggesting that agreement constitutes a meaningful functional category for LLMs. This pattern holds in English, Russian, and Chinese; and further, in a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, structurally more similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement.

Other affordance detection methods treat object detection and affordance learning as two independent tasks, lacking effective interaction and real-time capability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce YOLO Affordance (YOLOA), a real-time affordance detection model that jointly handles these two tasks via a large language model (LLM) adapter. Specifically, YOLOA employs a lightweight detector consisting of object detection and affordance learning branches refined through the LLM Adapter. During training, the LLM Adapter interacts with object and affordance preliminary predictions to refine both branches by generating more accurate class priors, box offsets, and affordance gates. Experiments on our relabeled ADG-Det and IIT-Heat benchmarks demonstrate that YOLOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (52.8 / 73.1 mAP on ADG-Det / IIT-Heat) while maintaining real-time performance (up to 89.77 FPS, and up to 846.24 FPS for the lightweight variant).

In this paper, we identify and empirically validate this phenomenon in UMGMs and provide a theoretical explanation rooted in gradient conflict between modalities. To address both intra- and inter-modal forgetting, we propose Modality-Decoupled Experts (MoDE), a lightweight and scalable architecture that isolates modality-specific updates to mitigate the gradient conflict and leverages knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting and preserve pre-trained capabilities.

Experiments on the Multi-Session Chat (MSC) dataset demonstrate that DZ-TDPO achieves state-of-the-art win rates (86.2% on Phi-3.5) while maintaining robust zero-shot generalization. Crucially, our scaling analysis reveals a \"Capacity-Stability Trade-off\": while smaller models incur an \"alignment tax\" (perplexity surge) to overcome historical inertia, the larger Qwen2.5-7B model achieves near-perfect alignment (99.4% win rate) with negligible perplexity overhead.

Traditional reference-based variant calling pipelines struggle with novel mutations and require extensive computational resources. We present a comprehensive framework for unsupervised viral variant detection using Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) that learns discrete codebooks of genomic patterns from k-mer tokenized sequences without requiring reference genomes or variant labels. Our approach extends the base VQ-VAE architecture with masked reconstruction pretraining for robustness to missing data and contrastive learning for highly discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequencing data comprising approximately 100,000 reads, our VQ-VAE achieves 99.52% mean token-level accuracy and 56.33% exact sequence match rate while maintaining 19.73% codebook utilization (101 of 512 codes active), demonstrating efficient discrete representation learning. Contrastive fine-tuning with different projection dimensions yields substantial clustering improvements: 64-dimensional embeddings achieve +35% Silhouette score improvement (0.31 to 0.42), while 128-dimensional embeddings achieve +42% improvement (0.31 to 0.44), clearly demonstrating the impact of embedding dimensionality on variant discrimination capability.

Experiments on two recent hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using only the provided sparse training labels.

In the meantime, they do not give the user any hints as to whether their reasoning is on the right track, and do not give the user any recourse to stop and correct them if their reasoning is flawed. This creates a frustrating, but unfortunately common, experience: the user's time is wasted while the model reasons from a false premise that could have easily been corrected. In contrast, human speakers typically perform lightweight, incremental grounding acts to ensure that participants in the conversation are on the same page; here we ask if language models can learn to leverage a similar type of behavior? With this motivation, we propose interleaved reasoning (IR), in which the model alternates between thinking and surfacing intermediate responses, as an alternative to the standard \"think-then-answer\" approach. By providing useful information to the user earlier, IR reduces perceived latency, the time a user waits for an initial output, without compromising the quality of the final response. We further introduce a specialization of interleaved reasoning, Plantain (Plan-Thought-Answer Interleaving), where the first intermediate response is an explicit, step-by-step plan for executing the task. This plan-first strategy allows for user intervention and early feedback for subsequent reasoning steps.

The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning tasks demonstrate that ESPO significantly outperforms token-level baselines, achieving dramatic improvements of 20-40 points on the Countdown task, while maintaining consistent gains on math and coding benchmarks.

Under Review", "summary": "Vision-language pretraining (VLP) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in medical image analysis, enabling representation learning from large-scale image-text pairs without relying on expensive manual annotations. However, existing methods often struggle with the noise inherent in web-collected data and the complexity of unstructured long medical texts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel VLP framework integrating a Multi-Agent data GENeration (MAGEN) system and Ontology-based Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced (O-MAKE) pretraining. First, MAGEN enhances data quality by synthesizing knowledge-enriched descriptions via a foundation model-assisted captioning and retrieval-based verification pipeline. Second, O-MAKE addresses the difficulty of learning from long, unstructured texts by decomposing them into distinct knowledge aspects. This facilitates fine-grained alignment at both global and patch levels, while explicitly modeling medical concept relationships through ontology-guided mechanisms. We validate our framework in the field of dermatology, where comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component.

The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \\textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \\textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment.

Most existing work relies on manual ROIs and rarely reports quality control (QC). We present LM-CartSeg, a fully automatic pipeline for cartilage/bone segmentation, geometric lateral/medial (L/M) compartmentalisation and radiomics analysis. Methods: Two 3D nnU-Net models were trained on SKM-TEA (138 knees) and OAIZIB-CM (404 knees). At test time, zero-shot predictions were fused and refined by simple geometric rules: connected-component cleaning, construction of 10 mm subchondral bone bands in physical space, and a data-driven tibial L/M split based on PCA and k-means. Segmentation was evaluated on an OAIZIB-CM test set (103 knees) and on SKI-10 (100 knees). QC used volume and thickness signatures. From 10 ROIs we extracted 4 650 non-shape radiomic features to study inter-compartment similarity, dependence on ROI size, and OA vs. non-OA classification on OAIZIB-CM Results: Post-processing improved macro ASSD on OAIZIB-CM from 2.63 to 0.36 mm and HD95 from 25.2 to 3.35 mm, with DSC 0.91; zero-shot DSC on SKI-10 was 0.80. The geometric L/M rule produced stable compartments across datasets, whereas a direct L/M nnU-Net showed domain-dependent side swaps. Only 6 to 12 percent of features per ROI were strongly correlated with volume or thickness. Radiomics-based models models restricted to size-linked features.

However, LLM output - here, the category assigned to a text - depends heavily on the wording of the prompt. While literature on prompt engineering is expanding, few studies focus on classification tasks, and even fewer address domains like psychology, where constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions that may not be well represented in pre-training data. We present an empirical framework for optimizing LLM performance for identifying constructs in texts via prompt engineering. We experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies --codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting - with zero-shot and few-shot classification. We find that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations do not fully address performance loss accompanying a badly worded prompt. Instead, the most influential features of a prompt are the construct definition, task framing, and, to a lesser extent, the examples provided. Across three constructs and two models, the classifications most aligned with expert judgments resulted from a few-shot prompt combining codebook-guided empirical prompt selection with automatic prompt engineering. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers generate and evaluate as many prompt variants as feasible, whether human-crafted, automatically generated, or ideally both, and select prompts and examples based on empirical performance in a training dataset, validating the final approach in a holdout set. This procedure offers a practical, systematic, and theory-driven method for optimizing LLM prompts in settings where alignment with expert judgment is critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46prompt\u7684\u63aa\u8f9e\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316LLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684prompt\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cdprompt\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cpersona\u3001chain-of-thought\u548c\u89e3\u91caprompt\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0prompt\u63aa\u8f9e\u4e0d\u5f53\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002\u6700\u4f73prompt\u662f\u7ed3\u5408codebook-guided\u7ecf\u9a8cprompt\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u81ea\u52a8prompt\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684few-shot prompt\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684prompt\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\u9009\u62e9prompt\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u7559\u96c6\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6700\u7ec8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eprompt\u7684\u63aa\u8f9e\uff0c\u800c\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u5f97\u5230\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u4f53\u73b0\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u4f18\u5316LLM\u7684prompt\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cdprompt\u7b56\u7565\uff1acodebook-guided\u7ecf\u9a8cprompt\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u81ea\u52a8prompt\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001persona prompting\u3001chain-of-thought reasoning\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027prompt\uff0c\u91c7\u7528zero-shot\u548cfew-shot\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "Persona\u3001chain-of-thought\u548c\u89e3\u91caprompt\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0prompt\u63aa\u8f9e\u4e0d\u5f53\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684prompt\u662f\u7ed3\u5408codebook-guided\u7ecf\u9a8cprompt\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u81ea\u52a8prompt\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684few-shot prompt\u3002Prompt\u4e2d\u6700\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684prompt\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\u9009\u62e9prompt\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u7559\u96c6\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6700\u7ec8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316LLM prompt\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Transformer-based architectures (DiTs) and classifier-free guidance (CFG) are two cornerstones of this success, enabling strong prompt adherence and realistic video quality. Despite their versatility and superior performance, these models require intensive computation. Each video generation requires dozens of iterative steps, and CFG doubles the required compute. This inefficiency hinders broader adoption in downstream applications.\n  We introduce GalaxyDiT, a training-free method to accelerate video generation with guidance alignment and systematic proxy selection for reuse metrics. Through rank-order correlation analysis, our technique identifies the optimal proxy for each video model, across model families and parameter scales, thereby ensuring optimal computational reuse. We achieve $1.87\\times$ and $2.37\\times$ speedup on Wan2.1-1.3B and Wan2.1-14B with only 0.97% and 0.72% drops on the VBench-2.0 benchmark.

The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u533b\u5b66\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u533b\u751f\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u533b\u5b66\u5171\u8bc6\u6307\u5357\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u8bc6\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4f8b\u5916\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Sepsis-3\u5171\u8bc6\u5b9a\u4e49\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u578bLLM\u7684\u5355\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u5bfc\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8868\u793a\u548cLLM\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548cLLM\u6765\u6539\u5584\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches operate purely in the 2D pixel space and lack explicit mechanisms for modeling 3D structures, often resulting in temporally inconsistent geometries, implausible motions, and structural artifacts. In this work, we introduce geometric regularization losses into video generation by augmenting latent diffusion models with per-frame depth prediction. We adopted depth as the geometric representation because of the great progress in depth prediction and its compatibility with image-based latent encoders. Specifically, to enforce structural consistency over time, we propose a multi-view geometric loss that aligns the predicted depth maps across frames within a shared 3D coordinate system. Our method bridges the gap between appearance generation and 3D structure modeling, leading to improved spatio-temporal coherence, shape consistency, and physical plausibility.

In the second stage, we use these verification outputs as synthetic training data to fine-tune generative process reward models, which subsequently serve as reward signals during training. We show that aggregating multiple independent verifications at the step level produces training data for process reward models that surpass ground-truth outcome supervision, achieving 67.5 F1 on ProcessBench (a benchmark for identifying erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning) compared to 66.4 for reference-guided training and 61.9 for GPT-4o.

Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity.

Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization. In addition, we present DrivePilot, a multi-source VG dataset in AD, featuring semantic annotations generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-prompted LLM pipeline. Extensive evaluations on six benchmarks, ThinkDeeper ranks #1 on the Talk2Car leaderboard and surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on DrivePilot, MoCAD, and RefCOCO/+/g benchmarks.

However, many VLMs exhibit reduced factual recall performance compared to their LLM backbones, raising the question of how effective multimodal fine-tuning is at extending existing mechanisms within the LLM to visual inputs. We argue that factual recall based on visual inputs requires VLMs to solve a two-hop problem: (1) forming entity representations from visual inputs, and (2) recalling associated factual knowledge based on these entity representations. By benchmarking 14 VLMs with various architectures (LLaVA, Native, Cross-Attention), sizes (7B-124B parameters), and training setups on factual recall tasks against their original LLM backbone models, we find that 11 of 14 models exhibit factual recall degradation. We select three models with high and two models with low performance degradation, and use attribution patching, activation patching, and probing to show that degraded VLMs struggle to use the existing factual recall circuit of their LLM backbone, because they resolve the first hop too late in the computation. In contrast, high-performing VLMs resolve entity representations early enough to reuse the existing factual recall mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate two methods to recover performance: patching entity representations from the LLM backbone into the VLM, and prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning. Our results highlight that the speed of early entity resolution critically determines how effective VLMs are in using preexisting LLM mechanisms.

In this paper, we argue that language models should aim to capture the full spectrum of language variation (dialectal, historical, informal, etc.) rather than relying solely on standardized text. Focusing on Basque, a morphologically rich and low-resource language, we construct new corpora combining standard, social media, and historical sources, and pre-train the BERnaT family of encoder-only models in three configurations: standard, diverse, and combined.

However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u6253\u5370\u56fe\u50cf\uff08TPI\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLM\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u6536\u96c6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3LVLM\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u76f4\u63a5\u6e32\u67d3\u5230\u767d\u8272\u753b\u5e03\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6e32\u67d3\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7684LVLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e03\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTPI\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4ee5\u6587\u672c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ee5\u6587\u672c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aLVLM\u7684\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

We introduce BlendedNet++, a large-scale aerodynamic dataset and benchmark focused on blended wing body (BWB) aircraft. The dataset contains over 12,000 unique geometries, each simulated at a single flight condition, yielding 12,490 aerodynamic results for steady RANS CFD. For every case, we provide (i) integrated force/moment coefficients CL, CD, CM and (ii) dense surface fields of pressure and skin friction coefficients Cp and (Cfx, Cfy, Cfz). Using this dataset, we standardize a forward-surrogate benchmark to predict pointwise fields across six model families: GraphSAGE, GraphUNet, PointNet, a coordinate Transformer (Transolver-style), a FiLMNet (coordinate MLP with feature-wise modulation), and a Graph Neural Operator Transformer (GNOT). Finally, we present an inverse design task of achieving a specified lift-to-drag ratio under fixed flight conditions, implemented via a conditional diffusion model. To assess performance, we benchmark this approach against gradient-based optimization on the same surrogate and a diffusion-optimization hybrid that first samples with the conditional diffusion model and then further optimizes the designs. BlendedNet++ provides a unified forward and inverse protocol with multi-model baselines, enabling fair, reproducible comparison across architectures and optimization paradigms.

Exploring Religious Bias in Multilingual Large Language Models Across Major Religions", "comment": "18 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "While recent developments in large language models have improved bias detection and classification, sensitive subjects like religion still present challenges because even minor errors can result in severe misunderstandings. In particular, multilingual models often misrepresent religions and have difficulties being accurate in religious contexts. To address this, we introduce BRAND: Bilingual Religious Accountable Norm Dataset, which focuses on the four main religions of South Asia: Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam, containing over 2,400 entries, and we used three different types of prompts in both English and Bengali.

To enhance targets and suppress backgrounds, we propose the Basis Decomposition Module (BDM) as an extensible and lightweight module based on basis decomposition, which decomposes a complex feature into several basis features and enhances certain information while eliminating redundancy. Extending BDM leads to a series of modules, including the Spatial Difference Decomposition Module (SD$^\\mathrm{2}$M), Spatial Difference Decomposition Downsampling Module (SD$^\\mathrm{3}$M), and Temporal Difference Decomposition Module (TD$^\\mathrm{2}$M). Based on these modules, we develop the Spatial Difference Decomposition Network (SD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net) for single-frame ISTD (SISTD) and the Spatiotemporal Difference Decomposition Network (STD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net) for multi-frame ISTD (MISTD). SD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net integrates SD$^\\mathrm{2}$M and SD$^\\mathrm{3}$M within an adapted U-shaped architecture. We employ TD$^\\mathrm{2}$M to introduce motion information, which transforms SD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net into STD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net. Extensive experiments on SISTD and MISTD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. On the SISTD task, SD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net performs well compared to most established networks.

Existing approaches primarily analyze how an action is performed, while overlooking what it produces, i.e., the \\textbf{action effect}. Yet many errors manifest not in the execution itself but in the resulting outcome, such as an unintended object state or incorrect spatial arrangement. To address this gap, we propose Action Effect Modeling (AEM), a unified framework that jointly captures action execution and its outcomes through a probabilistic formulation. AEM first identifies the outcome of an action by selecting the most informative effect frame based on semantic relevance and visual quality. It then extracts complementary cues from visual grounding and symbolic scene graphs, aligning them in a shared latent space to form robust effect-aware representations. To detect mistakes, we further design a prompt-based detector that incorporates task-specific prompts and aligns each action segment with its intended execution semantics. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EgoPER and CaptainCook4D benchmarks under the challenging one-class classification (OCC) setting.

However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c31\u7269\u7406\u4f7f\u80fd\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ASPEN\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINN\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u521a\u6027\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPINN\u7531\u4e8eMLP\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8c31\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "ASPEN\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u96c6\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c31\u5c42\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5176\u8c31\u57fa\u3002", "result": "ASPEN\u5728\u590d\u6742Ginzburg-Landau\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08CGLE\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u771f\u503c\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e2d\u503c\u4e3a5.10 x 10^-3\uff0c\u5e76\u6b63\u786e\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "ASPEN\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c31\u57fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we address two complementary aspects of this process: vocabulary extension and pruning. The common approach to extension trains a new tokenizer on domain-specific text and appends the tokens that do not overlap with the existing vocabulary, which often results in many tokens that are unreachable or never used. We propose continued BPE training, which adapts a pre-trained tokenizer by continuing the BPE merge learning process on new data. Experiments across multiple languages and model families show that this approach improves tokenization efficiency and leads to better utilization of added vocabulary. We also introduce leaf-based vocabulary pruning, which removes redundant tokens while preserving model quality.

To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality.\n  This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7-33.1x and 3.3-13.2x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "AugServe\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u578bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6392\u961f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5148\u6765\u5148\u670d\u52a1\uff08FCFS\uff09\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u961f\u9996\u963b\u585e\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8bb8\u591a\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u6392\u961f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8d85\u8fc7\u670d\u52a1\u7b49\u7ea7\u76ee\u6807\uff08SLO\uff09\uff1b\u9759\u6001\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4ee4\u724c\u9650\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "AugServe\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bf7\u6c42\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u578bLLM\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u786c\u4ef6\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4ee4\u724c\u6279\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "AugServe\u7684\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6bd4vLLM\u9ad84.7-33.1\u500d\uff0c\u6bd4InferCept\u9ad83.3-13.2\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u9996\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff08TTFT\uff09\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe96.3%\u548c95.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "AugServe\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bf7\u6c42\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u6279\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u578bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

Existing action-centric methods struggle with the flexibility of real procedures, where step order varies depending on object states. In this work, we propose to shift the focus to an object-centric paradigm by regarding actions as mechanisms that drive state transitions. To advance this direction, we introduce Object-IVQA, a long-form instructional video benchmark with 107 videos and 514 open-ended question-answer pairs annotated with temporally grounded evidence.

Domain generalization (DG) solutions aim to address this issue by extracting domain-invariant representations that mitigate errors in unseen domains. However, in hydrological settings, each reservoir exhibits unique inflow patterns, while some metadata beyond observations like spatial information exerts indirect but significant influence. This mismatch limits the applicability of conventional DG techniques to many-domain hydrological systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose HydroDCM, a scalable DG framework for cross-reservoir inflow forecasting. Spatial metadata of reservoirs is used to construct pseudo-domain labels that guide adversarial learning of invariant temporal features. During inference, HydroDCM adapts these features through light-weight conditioning layers informed by the target reservoir's metadata, reconciling DG's invariance with location-specific adaptation. Experiment results on 30 real-world reservoirs in the Upper Colorado River Basin demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art DG baselines under many-domain conditions and remains computationally efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "HydroDCM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u6c34\u5e93\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6c34\u5e93\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4f2a\u9886\u57df\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0d\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6c34\u5e93\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u5373\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\uff08DG\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6c34\u6587\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6c34\u5e93\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6d41\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u4e00\u4e9b\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u95f4\u63a5\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6c34\u5e93\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4f2a\u9886\u57df\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0d\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0cHydroDCM\u901a\u8fc7\u7531\u76ee\u6807\u6c34\u5e93\u5143\u6570\u636e\u544a\u77e5\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8c03\u8282\u5c42\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u534f\u8c03DG\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79d1\u7f57\u62c9\u591a\u6cb3\u4e0a\u6e38\u6d41\u57df\u768430\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6c34\u5e93\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHydroDCM\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684DG\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "HydroDCM \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u6c34\u5e93\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387"}}

However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates.

A key finding is that TFMs can be pretrained entirely on synthetic datasets, opening opportunities to design data generators that encourage desirable model properties. Prior work has mainly focused on crafting high-quality priors over generators to improve overall pretraining performance. Our insight is that parameterizing the generator distribution enables an adversarial robustness perspective: during training, we can adapt the generator to emphasize datasets that are particularly challenging for the model. We formalize this by introducing an optimality gap measure, given by the difference between TFM performance and the best achievable performance as estimated by strong baselines such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests. Building on this idea, we propose Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM), a model-agnostic adversarial training framework. Applied to the TabPFN V2 classifier, RTFM improves benchmark performance, with up to a 6% increase in mean normalized AUC over the original TabPFN and other baseline algorithms, while requiring less than 100k additional synthetic datasets.

Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't exhibited by base models? Our work, SkillFactory, is a method for fine-tuning models to roughly learn these skills during a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Our approach does not rely on distillation from a stronger model, but instead uses samples from the model itself, rearranged to provide training data in the format of those skills. These \"silver\" SFT traces may be imperfect, but are nevertheless effective for priming a model to acquire skills during RL. Our evaluation shows that (1) starting from SkillFactory SFT initialization helps a model to generalize to harder variants of a task post-RL, despite lower performance pre-RL; (2) cognitive skills are indeed used by the model; (3) RLed SkillFactory models are more robust to regression on out-of-domain tasks than RLed base models.

EEA autonomously discovers and dynamically updates task-relevant semantic queries, and collects video frames closely matched to these queries as semantic anchors.

Traditional bias correction via data assimilation improves constrained simulations but offers limited benefit once models run freely. We introduce an operator-learning framework that maps instantaneous model states to bias-correction tendencies and applies them online during integration. Building on a U-Net backbone, we develop two operator architectures Inception U-Net (IUNet) and a multi-scale network (M\\&M) that combine diverse upsampling and receptive fields to capture multiscale nonlinear features under Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) runtime constraints. Trained on two years E3SM simulations nudged toward ERA5 reanalysis, the operators generalize across height levels and seasons. Both architectures outperform standard U-Net baselines in offline tests, indicating that functional richness rather than parameter count drives performance.

Existing strategies for memory-bounded inference, such as quantization, offloading, or heuristic KV eviction, either incur high orchestration costs or rely on unreliable attention-based proxies of importance. We propose TRIM-KV, a novel approach that learns each token's intrinsic importance at creation time via a lightweight retention gate. Each gate predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, reflecting the long-term utility of the token for a specific layer and head. Tokens with low scores are evicted when the memory budget is exceeded, ensuring that the cache always contains the most critical tokens. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently through distillation from a frozen LLM combined with a capacity loss, requiring only gate fine-tuning and adding negligible inference overhead. Across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME24), procedural generation (LongProc), conversational long-memory benchmarks (LongMemEval), and long-context understanding (LongBench and SCBench), TRIM-KV consistently outperforms strong eviction and learnable retrieval baselines, especially in low-memory regimes. Remarkably, it even surpasses full-cache models in some settings, showing that selective retention can serve as a form of regularization, suppressing noise from uninformative tokens. Qualitative analyses further reveal that learned retention scores align with human intuition, naturally recovering heuristics such as sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit design. Beyond efficiency, retention scores provide insights into layer- and head-specific roles, suggesting a new path toward LLM interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a TRIM-KV \u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60token\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u7a0bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u7a0bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u7684\u952e\u503c(KV)\u7f13\u5b58\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u95e8\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684\u5185\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95e8\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u91cf\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u6570\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86token\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u548c\u5934\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6548\u7528\u3002\u5f53\u8d85\u8fc7\u5185\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5220\u9664\u4f4e\u5206\u6570\u7684token\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u4fdd\u7f13\u5b58\u59cb\u7ec8\u5305\u542b\u6700\u5173\u952e\u7684token\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684LLM\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u84b8\u998f\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5bb9\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3TRIM-KV\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u95e8\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4f1a\u8bdd\u957f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\uff0cTRIM-KV\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9a71\u9010\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b83\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5168\u7f13\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u6765\u81ea\u65e0\u4fe1\u606ftoken\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "conclusion": "TRIM-KV \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u7a0bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9LLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Our approach identifies dancers within video frames, counts discrete dance steps, calculates spatial coverage patterns, and measures rhythm consistency across performance sequences. Testing this framework on a single 49-second recording of Ghanaian AfroBeats dance demonstrates technical feasibility, with the system achieving approximately 94% detection precision and 89% recall on manually inspected samples. The pixel-level segmentation provided by SAM, achieving approximately 83% intersection-over-union with visual inspection, enables motion quantification that captures body configuration changes beyond what bounding-box approaches can represent. Analysis of this preliminary case study indicates that the dancer classified as primary by our system executed 23% more steps with 37% higher motion intensity and utilized 42% more performance space compared to dancers classified as secondary. However, this work represents an early-stage investigation with substantial limitations including single-video validation, absence of systematic ground truth annotations, and lack of comparison with existing pose estimation methods.

This key equivalence allows SAFLe to be solved with AFL's single-shot, invariant aggregation law.

We propose CSMapping, a system that produces accurate semantic maps and topological road centerlines whose quality consistently increases with more crowdsourced data. For semantic mapping, we train a latent diffusion model on HD maps (optionally conditioned on SD maps) to learn a generative prior of real-world map structure, without requiring paired crowdsourced/HD-map supervision. This prior is incorporated via constrained MAP optimization in latent space, ensuring robustness to severe noise and plausible completion in unobserved areas. Initialization uses a robust vectorized mapping module followed by diffusion inversion; optimization employs efficient Gaussian-basis reparameterization, projected gradient descent zobracket multi-start, and latent-space factor-graph for global consistency. For topological mapping, we apply confidence-weighted k-medoids clustering and kinematic refinement to trajectories, yielding smooth, human-like centerlines robust to trajectory variation.

This motivates the use of Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) for rapid, offline assessment. However, applying OPE to ad auctions is fundamentally more challenging than in domains like recommender systems, where stochastic policies are common. In online ad auctions, it is common for the highest-bidding ad to win the impression, resulting in a deterministic, winner-takes-all setting. This results in zero probability of exposure for non-winning ads, rendering standard OPE estimators inapplicable. We introduce the first principled framework for OPE in deterministic auctions by repurposing the bid landscape model to approximate the propensity score. This model allows us to derive robust approximate propensity scores, enabling the use of stable estimators like Self-Normalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) for counterfactual evaluation. We validate our approach on the AuctionNet simulation benchmark and against 2-weeks online A/B test from a large-scale industrial platform. Our method shows remarkable alignment with online results, achieving a 92\\% Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) in CTR prediction, significantly outperforming the parametric baseline. MDA is the most critical metric for guiding deployment decisions, as it reflects the ability to correctly predict whether a new model will improve or harm performance.

We find that a straightforward implementation of vanilla diffusion forcing (as proposed for video models) fails to model real motion distributions. We demonstrate that to guarantee modeling the output distribution, the vanilla diffusion forcing must be tailored to: (i) train with a bi-directional attention instead of casual attention; (ii) implement a lower triangular time scheduler instead of a random one; (iii) utilize a continues time-varying way to introduce text conditioning. With these improvements, we demonstrate in the first time that the diffusion forcing-based framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the streaming motion generation task, reaching an FID of 0.057 on the HumanML3D benchmark.

Classical aggregation rules assume euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, limiting their suitability for emerging quantum federated systems. This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. We develop the A2G update rule, establish convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G recovers FedAvg, QoS aware averaging, and manifold based aggregation as special cases. Experiments on a quantum classical hybrid testbed demonstrate improved stability and higher accuracy under heterogeneous and noisy conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u589e\u76ca\u6846\u67b6A2G\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u589e\u76ca\u548cQoS\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5047\u8bbe\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5fb7\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5747\u3001\u968f\u673a\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u914d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86A2G\uff08Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u51e0\u4f55\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684QoS\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86A2G\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u6709\u754c\u65b9\u5dee\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cA2G \u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "A2G \u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d FedAvg\u3001QoS \u611f\u77e5\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u805a\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We attribute this to two key limitations of existing methods: (1) proposal generation relies on dataset-specific proposal networks or mesh-based superpoints, rendering them inapplicable in mesh-free scenarios and limiting generalization to novel scenes; and (2) the weak textual reasoning of CLIP-based classifiers, which struggle to recognize compositional and functional user queries. To address these issues, we introduce OpenTrack3D, a generalizable and accurate framework. Unlike methods that rely on pre-generated proposals, OpenTrack3D employs a novel visual-spatial tracker to construct cross-view consistent object proposals online. Given an RGB-D stream, our pipeline first leverages a 2D open-vocabulary segmenter to generate masks, which are lifted to 3D point clouds using depth. Mask-guided instance features are then extracted using DINO feature maps, and our tracker fuses visual and spatial cues to maintain instance consistency. The core pipeline is entirely mesh-free, yet we also provide an optional superpoints refinement module to further enhance performance when scene mesh is available. Finally, we replace CLIP with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM), significantly enhancing compositional reasoning for complex user queries.

However, their ability to interpret cartographic maps remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CartoMapQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' understanding of cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning. Our evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveals persistent challenges: models frequently struggle with map-specific semantics, exhibit limited geospatial reasoning, and are prone to Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-related errors. By isolating these weaknesses, CartoMapQA offers a valuable tool for guiding future improvements in LVLM architectures. Ultimately, it supports the development of models better equipped for real-world applications that depend on robust and reliable map understanding, such as navigation, geographic search, and urban planning.

To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures.

We introduce UniQL, a unified post-training quantization and low-rank compression framework with on-device configurable pruning rates for edge LLMs. UniQL is a general framework that integrates quantization and low-rank compression for Transformers, State Space Models (SSMs), and hybrid models to support diverse edge applications. In our proposed joint framework, we introduce an efficient structured weight-sorting method that speeds up computation by 20x, quantization-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) to minimize quantization errors, state-aware weight sorting for SSMs, and a fused rotary positional embedding (RoPE) kernel for pruned models. Our framework performs weight-sorting, fine-tuning, and quantization in the cloud in a single-pass workflow, while enabling on-device configurable pruning rates up to 35%. Our experiments show that quantized and pruned models achieve a memory reduction of 4x-5.7x and a token-throughput improvement of 2.7x-3.4x, maintaining accuracy within 5% of the original models at 15% pruning across Transformers (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), SSMs (Mamba2), and hybrid models (Nemotron-H and Bamba-v2).

Comparing their vision encoder against simple alternatives--parameter-free mean pooling and a learned hierarchical encoder--we find that these simple approaches match or surpass vision for reconstruction at matched compression ratios, and outperform it for language modeling--where vision-based compression fails to beat truncation.

While recent diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, they struggle to handle structured multi-step scenarios like recipe illustration. Additionally, current recipe illustration methods are unable to adjust to the natural variability in recipe length, generating a fixed number of images regardless of the actual instructions structure. To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length. The framework introduces three key components: (1) Step-wise Regional Control (SRC), which aligns textual steps with corresponding image regions within a single denoising process; (2) Flexible RoPE, a step-aware positional encoding mechanism that enhances both temporal coherence and spatial diversity; and (3) Cross-Step Consistency Control (CSCC), which maintains fine-grained ingredient consistency across steps.

We introduce a novel tuning-free framework that leverages Implicit Regularization (IR) from overparameterization to overcome this limitation. Our approach reparameterizes the estimation matrix into factors that decouple the shared row-support from individual vector entries. We show that the optimization dynamics inherently promote the desired row-sparse structure by applying gradient descent to a standard least-squares objective on these factors. We prove that with a sufficiently small and balanced initialization, the optimization dynamics exhibit a \"momentum-like\" effect, causing the norms of rows in the true support to grow significantly faster than others. This formally guarantees that the solution trajectory converges towards an idealized row-sparse solution.

In this work, we first reveal a critical and previously overlooked weakness: even state-of-the-art MLLMs are surprisingly brittle, showing significant performance degradation on images with simple orientation changes or natural corruptions, underscoring the need for more robust tool-based reasoning. To address this, we propose CodeVision, a flexible and scalable code-as-tool framework where the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries. We train our model using a two-stage methodology, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a high-quality dataset curated for complex, multi-turn tool composition and error recovery, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel and dense process reward function to encourage strategic and efficient tool use. To facilitate this research, we construct new SFT and RL datasets and introduce a challenging new benchmark suite designed to rigorously evaluate robustness to orientation changes and multi-tool reasoning. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series show that our approach significantly improves model performance and fosters emergent capabilities such as flexible tool composition, efficient chained execution, and robust error recovery from runtime feedback.

This issue stems from a fundamental problem of visual neglect, where models fail to adequately prioritize input images. Existing methods typically alleviate hallucinations by intervening in the attention score or output logits, focusing on \"how to intervene\" but overlooking the prerequisite \"when to intervene\", which leads to the \"over-intervention\" problem and subsequently introduces new hallucinations and unnecessary computational overhead. To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks and different MLLM families demonstrate that V-ITI consistently mitigates vision-related hallucinations while preserving general task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(MLLM)\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3MLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5ffd\u89c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u5934\u90e8\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u89c9\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u6846\u67b6V-ITI\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ec5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u5ffd\u89c6\u65f6\u624d\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u8f7b\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f97\u5206\u6216\u8f93\u51falogits\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u201c\u5982\u4f55\u5e72\u9884\u201d\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5148\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\u201c\u4f55\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u201d\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u201c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e72\u9884\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u6b64\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7MLLM\u4e2d\u5934\u90e8\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5b83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86V-ITI\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5ffd\u89c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08Visual Neglect Detector\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5934\u90e8\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5224\u522b\u63a2\u9488\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u89c9\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u56de\u5fc6\u5e72\u9884\u5668\uff08Visual Recall Intervenor\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u5ffd\u89c6\u65f6\uff0c\u624d\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684MLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cV-ITI\u59cb\u7ec8\u5982\u4e00\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "V-ITI\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86MLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance by learning expressive representations via message passing, they incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), offers a lightweight, brain-inspired alternative, yet existing HDC-based graph methods typically struggle to match the predictive performance of GNNs. In this work, we propose VS-Graph, a vector-symbolic graph learning framework that narrows the gap between the efficiency of HDC and the expressive power of message passing. VS-Graph introduces a Spike Diffusion mechanism for topology-driven node identification and an Associative Message Passing scheme for multi-hop neighborhood aggregation entirely within the high-dimensional vector space. Without gradient-based optimization or backpropagation, our method achieves competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, outperforming the prior HDC baseline by 4-5% on standard benchmarks such as MUTAG and DD. It also matches or exceeds the performance of the GNN baselines on several datasets while accelerating the training by a factor of up to 450x. Furthermore, VS-Graph maintains high accuracy even with the hypervector dimensionality reduced to D=128, demonstrating robustness under aggressive dimension compression and paving the way for ultra-efficient execution on edge and neuromorphic hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "VS-Graph: a vector-symbolic graph learning framework that balances efficiency and expressiveness for graph classification.", "motivation": "Existing HDC-based graph methods struggle to match the predictive performance of GNNs, while GNNs incur high computational costs.", "method": "Spike Diffusion mechanism for topology-driven node identification and Associative Message Passing scheme for multi-hop neighborhood aggregation.", "result": "Competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, outperforming the prior HDC baseline by 4-5% and accelerating the training by a factor of up to 450x.

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaptVision\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548VLM\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u89c9token\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9tokens\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671bVLMs\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u89c6\u89c9token\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u5904\u7406\u6765\u81ea\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u89c9tokens\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u5de5\u5177\u88c1\u526a\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u83b7\u53d6\u989d\u5916\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8bad\u7ec3AdaptVision\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ed4\u7ec6\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u89e3\u8026\u8f6c\u5411\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08DTPO\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u5de5\u5177\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff1b(2) \u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAdaptVision\u5728\u6d88\u8017\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684VLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c11\u5f97\u591a\u7684\u89c6\u89c9tokens\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaptVision\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u89c9token\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We present a hybrid moderation framework deployed at production scale that combines supervised classification for known violations with reference-based similarity matching for novel or subtle cases. This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight.

Even an AI system that is perfectly aligned to the intentions of its operating organization can lead to bad outcomes if the goals of that organization are misaligned with those of other institutions and individuals. For this reason, we need full-stack alignment, the concurrent alignment of AI systems and the institutions that shape them with what people value. This can be done without imposing a particular vision of individual or collective flourishing. We argue that current approaches for representing values, such as utility functions, preference orderings, or unstructured text, struggle to address these and other issues effectively. They struggle to distinguish values from other signals, to support principled normative reasoning, and to model collective goods. We propose thick models of value will be needed. These structure the way values and norms are represented, enabling systems to distinguish enduring values from fleeting preferences, to model the social embedding of individual choices, and to reason normatively, applying values in new domains. We demonstrate this approach in five areas: AI value stewardship, normatively competent agents, win-win negotiation systems, meaning-preserving economic mechanisms, and democratic regulatory institutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fddAI\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e2aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u201c\u5168\u6808\u5bf9\u9f50\u201d\uff0c\u5373AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u5176\u5851\u9020\u673a\u6784\u90fd\u8981\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u5373\u4f7fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5176\u8fd0\u8425\u673a\u6784\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u8be5\u673a\u6784\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u673a\u6784\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u826f\u540e\u679c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u5176\u5851\u9020\u673a\u6784\u4e0e\u4eba\u4eec\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u201c\u539a\u6a21\u578b\u201d\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u548c\u77ed\u6682\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e2a\u4eba\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aAI\u4ef7\u503c\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u8303\u80fd\u529b\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u53cc\u8d62\u8c08\u5224\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u4fdd\u4e49\u7ecf\u6d4e\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6c11\u4e3b\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8868\u793a\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\u6216\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u539a\u6a21\u578b\u4ef7\u503c\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages. However, this field has made slow progress due to the inaccuracy of text conversion, pose generation, and the rendering of poses into real human videos in these stages, resulting in gradually accumulating errors. Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos. SLUL is trained using the newly developed Semantic-Aware Gloss Masking Loss (SAGM Loss).

We use a controlled 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube and ask: (1) how does explicitly pretraining a world model affect the model's latent representations, and (2) how does world-model quality affect the model's performance after reinforcement learning post-training? We compare standard next-token prediction to two explicit world-modeling strategies -- (i) state-prediction pretraining and (ii) a joint state-prediction + next-token objective -- and assess task performance after Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied as post-training. We evaluate the representation quality with linear probes and causal interventions. We find that explicit world-modeling yields more linearly decodable and causally steerable state representations.

To address the significant gap between textual descriptions and 3D articulated object representations, we propose GAOT, a three-phase framework that generates articulated objects from text prompts, leveraging diffusion models and hypergraph learning in a three-step process. First, we fine-tune a point cloud generation model to produce a coarse representation of objects from text prompts.

To tackle these challenges, we propose an end-to-end framework called Global-Local Aware Scene Text Editing (GLASTE), which simultaneously incorporates high-level global contextual information along with delicate local features. Specifically, we design a global-local combination structure, joint global and local losses, and enhance text image features to ensure consistency in text style within local patches while maintaining harmony between local and global areas. Additionally, we express the text style as a vector independent of the image size, which can be transferred to target text images of various sizes.

Starting from the information-theoretic perspective, we formulate the vision compression as an optimization problem that minimizes conditional entropy (reconstruction error) between retained and full tokens. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of information uniqueness to measure intrinsic redundancy among tokens to link with reconstruction error. Based on uniqueness, we design three modules-Frame Group Fusion, Token Allocation, and Spatial Dynamic Compression-that progressively perform semantic frame grouping, adaptive resource allocation, and fine-grained spatial compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniComp consistently outperforms existing compression methods in preserving essential visual tokens under limited computational budgets, highlighting the pivotal role of information uniqueness in token compression efficacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6UniComp\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u5927\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4fdd\u7559\u7684token\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684token\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\uff08\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0cUniComp\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u5728token\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often struggle to effectively integrate diverse opinion modalities and capture fine-grained interactions across them. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates two distinct modalities of financial opinions: recency modality (timely opinions) and popularity modality (trending opinions), through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism specifically designed for financial sentiment analysis. While both modalities consist of textual data, they represent fundamentally different information channels: recency-driven market updates versus popularity-driven collective sentiment. Our model first uses BERT (Chinese-wwm-ext) for feature embedding and then employs our proposed Financial Multi-Head Cross-Attention (FMHCA) structure to facilitate information exchange between these distinct opinion modalities. The processed features are optimized through a transformer layer and fused using multimodal factored bilinear pooling for classification into negative, neutral, and positive sentiment. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive dataset covering 837 companies demonstrate that our approach achieves an accuracy of 83.5%, significantly outperforming baselines including BERT+Transformer by 21 percent.

Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

It has been widely applied to uncover the subtypes of many diseases and inform our understanding of them. But how robust is its performance? In this paper, we develop a principled Bayesian subtype variant of the event-based model (BEBMS) and compare its performance to SuStaIn in a variety of synthetic data experiments with varied levels of model misspecification. BEBMS substantially outperforms SuStaIn across ordering, staging, and subtype assignment tasks. Further, we apply BEBMS and SuStaIn to a real-world Alzheimer's data set.

Although recent diffusion-based approaches improve upon traditional optical-flow-based methods, they still struggle to cover diverse application scenarios and often fail to produce sharp, temporally consistent frames in fine-grained motion tasks such as audio-visual synchronized interpolation. To address these limitations, we introduce BBF (Beyond Boundary Frames), a context-aware video frame interpolation framework, which could be guided by audio/visual semantics. First, we enhance the input design of the interpolation model so that it can flexibly handle multiple conditional modalities, including text, audio, images, and video. Second, we propose a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism that sequentially injects different conditional signals into a DiT backbone. Finally, to maintain the generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt a progressive multi-stage training paradigm, where the start-end frame difference embedding is used to dynamically adjust both the data sampling and the loss weighting.

In contrast, mixed pathologies are common in neurodegeneration. We introduce the Joint Progression Model (JPM), a probabilistic framework that treats single-disease trajectories as partial rankings and builds a prior over joint progressions. We study several JPM variants (Pairwise, Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, and Mallows) and analyze three properties: (i) calibration -- whether lower model energy predicts smaller distance to the ground truth ordering; (ii) separation -- the degree to which sampled rankings are distinguishable from random permutations; and (iii) sharpness -- the stability of sampled aggregate rankings. All variants are calibrated, and all achieve near-perfect separation; sharpness varies by variant and is well-predicted by simple features of the input partial rankings (number and length of rankings, conflict, and overlap). In synthetic experiments, JPM improves ordering accuracy by roughly 21 percent over a strong EBM baseline (SA-EBM) that treats the joint disease as a single condition. Finally, using NACC, we find that the Mallows variant of JPM and the baseline model (SA-EBM) have results that are more consistent with prior literature on the possible disease progression of the mixed pathology of AD and VaD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff08JPM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u65ad\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u5f88\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u75be\u75c5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5355\u75c5\u7a0b\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c6\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86JPM\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\uff08Pairwise\u3001Bradley-Terry\u3001Plackett-Luce\u548cMallows\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\uff1a\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u3001\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u548c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u53d8\u4f53\u90fd\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5206\u79bb\uff1b\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u56e0\u53d8\u4f53\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u90e8\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\uff09\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cJPM\u6bd4\u5c06\u8054\u5408\u75be\u75c5\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u75c5\u75c7\u7684\u5f3aEBM\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08SA-EBM\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea621%\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NACC\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0JPM\u7684Mallows\u53d8\u4f53\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff08SA-EBM\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8eAD\u548cVaD\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u6587\u732e\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "JPM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fMallows\u53d8\u4f53\u3002"}}

The inherent complexity of this task stems from the intricate relationship between sequence and structure, making it particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework, named HyperRNA, a generative model with an encoder-decoder architecture that leverages hypergraphs to design RNA sequences. Specifically, our HyperRNA model consists of three main components: preprocessing, encoding and decoding.\n  In the preprocessing stage, graph structures are constructed by extracting the atom coordinates of RNA backbone based on 3-bead coarse-grained representation. The encoding stage processes these graphs, capturing higher order dependencies and complex biomolecular interactions using an attention embedding module and a hypergraph-based encoder.

We introduce ATHENA (Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms), an agentic framework designed as an Autonomous Lab to manage the end-to-end computational research lifecycle. Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems. The framework achieves super-human performance, reaching validation errors of $10^{-14}$. Furthermore, collaborative ``human-in-the-loop\" intervention allows the system to bridge stability gaps, improving results by an order of magnitude. This paradigm shift focuses from implementation mechanics to methodological innovation, accelerating scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "ATHENA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7ba1\u7406\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u8d85\u4eba\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u8bba\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662fHENA\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587Bandit\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u4e13\u5bb6\u84dd\u56fe\u4ece\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u7ed3\u6784\u201c\u52a8\u4f5c\u201d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u4eba\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bef\u5dee\u8fbe\u523010^{-14}\u3002\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u5c06\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u5b9e\u65bd\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u65b9\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u901f\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

CloseUpAvatar represents an avatar as a set of textured planes with two sets of learnable textures for low and high-frequency detail. The method automatically switches to high-frequency textures only for cameras positioned close to the avatar's surface and gradually reduces their impact as the camera moves farther away. Such parametrization of the avatar enables CloseUpAvatar to adjust rendering quality based on camera distance ensuring realistic rendering across a wider range of camera orientations than previous approaches.
