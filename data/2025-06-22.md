TL;DR: a new corpus for adverse event extraction in elderly patients is presented, models perform well on coarse-grained extraction but struggle with fine-grained details and rare events


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work

Method: evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation

Result: transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675)

Conclusion: transformer-based models achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction, but performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks, particularly for rare events and complex attributes. significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BoostCD, a two-phase approach that combines constrained and unconstrained decoding to improve the quality of structured NLP tasks. A boosted model learns to combine the two predictions into a final prediction. The model BoostIE outperforms prior approaches in closed information extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model  M to map unstructured input text  x to output text  y representing structured objects, where the desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs  y. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time.

Method: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model  M twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction.

Result: The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction.

Conclusion: Our model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrEst 是一种用于评估 LLM 推理期间上下文文档可信度的新型弱监督框架，无需手动注释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文信息的整合显着提高了大型语言模型 (LLM) 在知识密集型任务中的性能。然而，现有方法通常忽略了一个关键挑战：上下文文档的可信度可能差异很大，可能导致不可靠信息的传播。

Method: 一种新颖的弱监督框架，用于在 LLM 推理期间评估上下文文档的可信度——无需手动注释。该方法基于以下洞察：可信的文档往往与其他可信的文档表现出更高的语义连贯性，从而可以通过文档间协议自动进行可信度估计。

Result: 引入了 CrEst，一种用于评估 LLM 推理期间上下文文档可信度的新型弱监督框架，无需手动注释。CrEst 在准确率和 F1 值方面均优于强大的基线。

Conclusion: CrEst在三个模型架构和五个数据集上始终优于强大的基线，准确率提高了 26.86%，F1 值提高了 3.49%。即使在高噪声条件下，CrEst 也能保持强大的性能。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们提出了 MDBench，这是一个用于评估 LLM 在多文档推理任务中的新数据集，它通过一种新颖的合成生成过程创建，该过程允许我们可控且高效地生成具有挑战性的文档集和相应的问答 (QA) 示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着 LLM 的推理能力快速扩展，新的评估基准越来越重要。特别是，鉴于 LLM 在处理更长上下文输入方面的能力，多文档 (MD) 推理是一个极其相关的领域，但很少有基准来严格检查模型在此设置中的行为。此外，由于注释长输入的成本高昂，多文档设置历来对基准创建具有挑战性。

Method: 一种新颖的合成生成过程，允许我们可控且高效地生成具有挑战性的文档集和相应的问答 (QA) 示例。我们的新技术对浓缩的结构化种子知识进行操作，通过 LLM 辅助的编辑对其进行修改，以引发 MD 特定的推理挑战。

Result: 知识引导生成技术 (1) 使我们能够轻松地对 MD 特定的推理能力进行有针对性的分析，并且 (2) 可以快速适应以应对新的挑战和未来的建模改进。

Conclusion: MDBENCH对所有方法都提出了重大挑战，即使是相对较短的文档集。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study tests the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes, finding that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones and even outperform traditional ML models in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured numerical data is still not well explored, while Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely used for diabetes prediction.

Method: The effectiveness of LLMs is tested in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting methods. An empirical analysis is conducted using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). Six LLMs are evaluated, including Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-2B, GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. Their performance is compared with three traditional machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used as evaluation metrics.

Result: Proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.

Conclusion: Proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score. However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [6] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM可以通过优化特殊记忆令牌的嵌入来精确地重建原始文本，而无需修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们观察到一个有趣的现象：可以生成可逆的句子嵌入，允许LLM完全重建原始文本，而无需修改模型的权重。

Method: 通过引入一个特殊的记忆令牌来实现，该令牌的嵌入通过在固定序列上训练进行优化。当使用此嵌入提示时，模型会精确地重建固定序列。

Result: Llama 3.1 8B 成功地重建了所有测试序列。我们在英语和西班牙语数据集、最多约 240 个 tokens 的序列以及从 100M 到 8B 参数的模型尺度上评估了这一现象。

Conclusion: LLMs展现出一种有趣的能力，即能够通过可逆的句子嵌入精确地重建原始文本，而无需修改模型的权重。这表明LLMs在基于记忆的检索、压缩和受控文本生成方面具有潜在的应用。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用自然语言处理技术识别自杀案例中社会隔离和孤独感的模式，发现特定人群更容易出现慢性社会隔离，有助于改进社会隔离和孤独感的监测与预防。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，社会隔离和孤独感日益加剧，对自杀率有很大影响。然而，美国国家暴力死亡报告系统(NVDRS)的结构化变量中目前没有记录社会隔离和孤独感。

Method: 该研究采用主题建模和监督学习分类器等自然语言处理技术。

Result: 该研究开发了高质量的分类器（平均F1：0.86，准确率：0.82），并在2002年至2020年的30万多起自杀事件中识别出1198起提到慢性社会隔离的案例。研究发现，男性、同性恋者或离婚人士更有可能被归类为慢性社会隔离。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过自然语言处理技术，可以识别美国国家暴力死亡报告系统(NVDRS)中与社会隔离和孤独相关的模式，并发现了一些与慢性社会隔离相关的人群特征，如男性、同性恋者和离婚人士。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrefBERT是一个用于评估开放式长文本生成的评分模型，通过提供更好的语义奖励反馈来有效支持GRPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放式长文本生成的评估具有挑战性，因为很难明确区分好坏输出。现有方法经常忽略连贯性、风格或相关性等关键方面，或被预训练数据所偏见，使得开放式长文本评估成为一个未被充分探索的问题

Method: 提出 PrefBERT，一个用于评估 GRPO 中开放式长文本生成并指导其训练的评分模型，对好坏输出提供不同的奖励

Result: PrefBERT 在多句和段落长度的响应上训练，在不同的长段落中保持可靠，并且与 GRPO 需要的可验证奖励很好地对齐。使用 PrefBERT 作为奖励信号训练策略模型，产生的回复与人类偏好更好地对齐

Conclusion: PrefBERT作为奖励信号训练策略模型，产生的回复与人类偏好更好地对齐

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Investigating the impact of learning-time knowledge encoding on unlearning factual knowledge in LLMs, finding paraphrased descriptions improve unlearning but unlearning individual facts from text chunks is hard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to unlearn, or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc, has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations to correcting outdated or harmful content.

Method: Empirically investigate how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge.

Result: Learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance, and unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.

Conclusion: Learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [10] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) 和 Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) 的方法来解决对话语篇分析中的歧义问题，并在 STAC 和 Molweni 数据集上取得了 SOTA 结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话语篇分析旨在识别和分析对话中话语之间的语篇关系。然而，对话中的语言特征，如省略和习语，经常会引入歧义，从而掩盖预期的语篇关系，对解析器提出了重大挑战。

Method: 我们提出了一个Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) 来增强对话语篇分析器的性能。DCM 采用了两种不同的推理过程：澄清类型推理和语篇目标推理。前者分析语言特征，而后者区分预期关系和模糊关系。此外，我们还引入了 Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) 来降低错误澄清的风险，从而减少级联错误。CPO 使解析器能够评估 DCM 中澄清的贡献，并提供反馈以优化 DCM，从而增强其适应性和与解析器要求的对齐。

Result: 我们的方法有效地解决了歧义，并且明显优于当前最优的 (SOTA) 基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在 STAC 和 Molweni 数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明，该方法能够有效地解决歧义，并且明显优于当前最优的 (SOTA) 基线。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CKD-EHR利用知识蒸馏技术，提高了疾病风险预测的效率和准确性，并在MIMIC-III数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在医学知识的表示方面不足，并且在临床部署中的效率较低。

Method: 知识蒸馏技术，利用医学知识增强数据对大型语言模型Qwen2.5-7B进行微调作为教师模型，并通过多粒度注意力蒸馏机制生成可解释的软标签，然后将提取的知识转移到轻量级BERT学生模型。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，CKD-EHR 显著优于基线模型：诊断准确率提高了 9%，F1-score 提高了 27%，并且实现了 22.2 倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: CKD-EHR通过知识蒸馏提高了资源利用效率，增强了诊断的准确性和及时性，为临床环境中的资源优化提供了一种实用的技术方法。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper models the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), and introduces o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the o2m property. The proposed two-stage framework enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly model the one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context, which can boost response diversity.

Method: modeling the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS)

Result: applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

Conclusion: Applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer, reduces token fertility by 10% without compromising model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: reducing token fertility without compromising model performance.

Method: rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of the Korean language. a seed vocabulary containing tokens that resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection algorithm.

Result: Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% compared to BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Thunder-Tok is effective and practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to

TL;DR: This paper studies memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency effects. It finds a U-shaped accuracy profile and identifies three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and forgotten over time.

Method: Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture

Result: Observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. Identify three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern: long-term memory, short-term memory and memory allocation.

Conclusion: Memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the tendency to forget intermediate items. The findings are validated via targeted ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

TL;DR: This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs and Reveals that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking progress toward the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics.

Method: This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot

reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRM）在长链思维（Long CoT）推理方面的最新进展表明了卓越的跨领域泛化能力。然而，支持这种转移的潜在机制仍然知之甚少。

Method: ProtoReasoning框架，利用可扩展且可验证的原型表示（Prolog用于逻辑推理，PDDL用于规划）。

Result: ProtoReasoning在逻辑推理（Enigmata-Eval）方面比基线模型提高了4.7%，在规划任务中提高了6.3%，在一般推理（MMLU）中提高了4.0%，在数学（AIME24）中提高了1.0%。

Conclusion: ProtoReasoning在逻辑推理、规划、一般推理和数学方面均优于基线模型，并且在原型空间中学习可以增强对结构相似问题的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标难以捕捉语义相似性，当前的LLM评估方法缺乏直观的可解释性，并且现有方法忽略了事实型和非事实型问题之间的区别。

Method: MinosEval，一种新颖的评估方法，它首先区分开放式问题，然后使用不同的评估策略对候选答案进行排序。对于事实型问题，它应用自适应关键点评分策略，而对于非事实型问题，它使用实例感知列表排序策略。

Result: 在多个开放式QA数据集上的实验表明，MinosEval更好地与人类注释对齐，并提供更可解释的结果。

Conclusion: MinosEval更好地与人类注释对齐，并提供更可解释的结果。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

Motivation: Evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties.

Method: Evaluate LLMs on a novel parallel NLI dataset in Basque and Spanish varieties, using crosslingual and in-context learning.

Result: LLMs show a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, not due to lexical overlap. Encoder-only models struggle with Western Basque.

Conclusion: Linguistic variation causes performance drop in LLMs, especially in Basque. Encoder-only models struggle with Western Basque.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to

are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not well-suited for technical solutions.

Method: A de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant laws and practices; systematic categorization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII); an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: The construction and release of the first Korean legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of entity mentions.

Conclusion: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the de-identification of court judgments.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages in LID models perform poorly due to class imbalance and bias issues, often limited to single-domain data.

Result: Improved LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%.

Conclusion: This paper proposes a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages, improving LID performance on out-of-domain data by 3.2%.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Motivation: Current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns in LLMs used in clinical decision support.

Method: Introduce DeVisE, a behavioral testing framework with controlled single-variable counterfactuals, and evaluate five LLMs under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.

Result: Zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing can expose reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and inform the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI sets a new standard for assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to

personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for

Result: The study assesses the dataset's effectiveness by evaluating different component combinations, including identifying supportive comments and filtering out noise.

Conclusion: The study introduces COSMMIC, a new comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages, which uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback for NLP research.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TLI, a novel fine-tuning approach, improves cross-lingual lexical alignment in low-resource language LLMs by targeting and enhancing inherent early-layer knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) performance in low-resource languages (LRLs) often lags due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval.

Method: Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from an empirically identified optimal early layer.

Result: TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%). These improvements generalize remarkably well to unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%).

Conclusion: Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI) enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

TL;DR: AgentGroupChat-V2 是一个用于构建高效、通用的 LLM 多智能体系统的框架，它通过分而治之的架构、自适应协作引擎和智能体组织优化策略，在复杂推理场景中表现出显著的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大型语言模型的多智能体系统在社会模拟和复杂任务解决领域表现出巨大的潜力。然而，当前的框架在系统架构设计、跨领域通用性和性能保证方面面临着严峻的挑战，特别是随着任务复杂性和智能体数量的增加。

Method: AgentGroupChat-V2 框架通过三个核心创新来解决这些挑战：(1) 一种分而治之的完全并行架构，将用户查询分解为分层任务森林结构，从而实现依赖性管理和分布式并发处理。(2) 一种自适应协作引擎，可以根据任务特征动态选择异构 LLM 组合和交互模式。(3) 结合分而治之方法的智能体组织优化策略，以实现高效的问题分解。

Result: AgentGroupChat-V2 在不同领域表现出卓越的性能，在 GSM8K 上达到 91.50% 的准确率（超过最佳基线 5.6 个百分点），在竞赛级别的 AIME 上达到 30.4% 的准确率（几乎是其他方法的两倍），在 HumanEval 上达到 79.20% 的 pass@1。随着任务难度的增加，性能优势变得越来越明显，尤其是在 Level 5 MATH 问题上，与最先进的基线相比，改进超过 11 个百分点。

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 为构建高效、通用的 LLM 多智能体系统提供了一个全面的解决方案，并在复杂推理场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: LLMs' reasoning ability is questionable, they might just be memorizing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It is still unclear whether the observed results arise from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set.

Method: RE-IMAGINE, a framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside an automated pipeline to generate problem variations.

Result: Reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations.

Conclusion: LLMs rely on statistical recall for past performance.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: CINGS, a post-training supervision method, improves grounding in LLMs by training the model with relevant context prepended to the response and masking out the context during loss computation. CINGS outperforms existing methods in both textual and visual domains without sacrificing downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination. simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation.

Method: Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context.

Result: In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.

Conclusion: Models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. CINGS induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

*Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi,Xiaodan Zhu,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARE is introduced for efficient process annotation by aligning solution steps to reference solutions, improving reasoning performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient, high-quality automated process annotation for complex multi-step reasoning in LLMs remains a significant challenge.

Method: The paper introduces SPARE, a structured framework for single-pass, per-step annotation that aligns each solution step to a reference solution and provides explicit reasoning for evaluation.

Result: Reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets. SPARE improves reasoning performance and offers 2.6 times greater efficiency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SPARE improves reasoning performance when fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup and training reward models, achieving competitive performance with 2.6 times greater efficiency than tree search-based annotation.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种情感引导的夸张和隐喻检测框架EmoBi，通过情感分析、领域映射和双向动态交互来提高检测性能，实验结果表明该方法有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于文本的夸张和隐喻检测对于自然语言处理（NLP）任务具有重要意义。但是，由于它们的语义模糊性和表达多样性，因此识别它们非常具有挑战性。现有方法大多侧重于表面文本特征，而忽略了夸张和隐喻的关联以及隐式情感对感知这些修辞手段的影响。

Method: 提出了一种基于双向动态交互的情感引导的夸张和隐喻检测框架（EmoBi）。

Result: 实验表明，EmoBi在四个数据集上优于所有基线方法。与当前的SoTA相比，在TroFi数据集上的夸张检测的F1分数提高了28.1％，在HYPO-L数据集上的隐喻检测的F1分数提高了23.1％。

Conclusion: EmoBi在四个数据集上优于所有基线方法。具体而言，与当前的SoTA相比，在TroFi数据集上的夸张检测的F1分数提高了28.1％，在HYPO-L数据集上的隐喻检测的F1分数提高了23.1％。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs, and finds that reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL are valuable for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs). Instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available.

Method: Reinforcement learning (RL) with the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality.

Result: Reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Combining instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks.

Conclusion: Reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL are valuable for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: RATTENTION, a local attention variant with a specialized linear attention mechanism, achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency, enhances long-context performance, and maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window.

Method: RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from out-of-window tokens.

Result: RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance. RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency, consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings with a window size of just 512, enhances long-context performance, and maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Predictive Generation (PredGen) to reduce latency in LLM-based voice chat by generating candidate responses during user input, achieving a 2x latency reduction with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-time voice chat applications suffer from noticeable latency due to their size, especially when deployed on consumer-grade hardware. This latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence.

Method: The paper introduces Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that uses speculative decoding at input time to generate candidate responses while the user is still speaking.

Result: Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that PredGen can reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time.

Conclusion: The proposed Predictive Generation (PredGen) framework effectively reduces latency in LLM-based voice chat applications by generating candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling faster TTS processing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Result: Discovering significant variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity.

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of improving LLMs' inclusivity and provides a critical benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language

GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future

TL;DR: Introduces DiscoSG for discourse-level text scene graph parsing and DiscoSG-Refiner for efficient graph generation, improving performance and speed compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches miss cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance.

Method: DiscoSG-Refiner: drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits

Result: Fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline. DiscoSG-Refiner improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4.

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner achieves a 30% SPICE improvement over the best baseline with 86x faster inference than GPT-4, and improves downstream VLM tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

TL;DR: WikiMixQA benchmark reveals challenges in long-context, multi-modal document understanding for vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic document understanding (DU) is challenging due to complex layouts, tables, and charts. The effectiveness of vision-language large models (VLLMs) in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear.

Method: The authors created WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice questions based on tables and charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages.

Result: Proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy with direct context, but performance drops significantly with retrieval. GPT-4-o achieves over 50% accuracy in this setting, while open-source models perform worse (max 27%).

Conclusion: This paper introduces WikiMixQA, a new benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reasoning in documents, and finds that current vision-language models struggle with long-context, multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

Conclusion: current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones, but identify issues related to semantic clarity and answerability, and challenges remain in generating distractors that engage students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究后悔机制对于提高模型可靠性至关重要，并且有助于揭示认知如何在神经网络中编码。

Method: 提出：（1）通过战略性设计的提示场景构建综合后悔数据集的工作流程，（2）有监督压缩-解耦指数 (S-CDI) 指标来识别最佳后悔表示层，以及（3）后悔支配评分 (RDS) 指标来识别后悔神经元，以及组影响系数 (GIC) 来分析激活模式。

Result: 实验结果使用 S-CDI 指标成功识别了最佳后悔表示层，这显着提高了探针分类实验的性能。此外，我们还在模型层中发现了一种 M 形解耦模式，揭示了信息处理如何在耦合和解耦阶段之间交替。

Conclusion: 通过 RDS 指标，将神经元分为三个不同的功能组：后悔神经元、非后悔神经元和双重神经元。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

*Yuka Machino,Matthias Hofer,Max Siegel,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cross-cultural communication misunderstandings arise from both literal meaning and pragmatic factors like politeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It is unclear whether misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general pragmatic factors.

Method: Three experiments and a computational cognitive model were used to examine how speakers of British and American English interpret intensifiers.

Result: Cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of different literal meanings and different weights on utterance cost.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of different literal meanings and different weights on utterance cost.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

*Yusuke Sakai,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Ordered CommonGen, a new benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate sentences with concepts in a specified order. Experiments show that even the best LLMs struggle to achieve high ordered coverage, indicating a need for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts. However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order.

Method: We propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs

Result: while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered.

Conclusion: Even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Method: Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic abstractions.

Result: CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines on challenging reasoning benchmarks (including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA).

Conclusion: Cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs

Method: probing and agentic evaluations

Result: increased reasoning steps amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking

Conclusion: safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

TL;DR: MT systems mostly fail at gender-neutral translation, but some show promise using specific strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. Maintaining gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a challenge.

Method: Assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation directions.

Result: Observed a disappointing absence of gender-neutral translations, but a few MT systems use specific strategies for gender-neutral translation.

Conclusion: MT systems generally fail to produce gender-neutral translations when faced with gender ambiguity, but some systems use specific strategies to achieve this depending on the target language.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉语言模型 (VLM) 的大量计算需求，在实际场景中（尤其是在资源受限的设备上）部署这些模型仍然具有挑战性。这激发了人们对将知识从大型 VLM 提炼到更小、更高效的对应物中的兴趣。这里出现的一个关键挑战来自 VLM 架构的多样性，这些架构建立在不同的 LLM 上，并采用不同的令牌类型——在词汇量大小、令牌拆分和令牌索引顺序方面有所不同。

Method: 我们提出了 Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal)，这是一种用于 VLM 的新型通用蒸馏框架。GenRecal 包含一个重新校准器，可以对齐和调整异构 VLM 之间的特征表示，从而实现不同类型 VLM 之间的有效知识转移。

Result: 通过在多个具有挑战性的基准上进行的大量实验，我们证明了

Conclusion: GenRecal显著提高了基线性能，最终优于大规模开源和闭源视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的普及，使得诸如错误信息生成和学术不端等不良社会问题更加严重，使得LLM生成的文本检测现在具有前所未有的重要性。来自私下调整的LLM的文本带来了一个新的挑战，但尚未被充分探索。用户可以通过使用私有语料库对开源LLM进行微调来轻松拥有私有LLM，从而导致现有检测器在实践中性能显著下降。

Method: 提出了PhantomHunter，一个专门用于检测来自未见过的、私下调整的LLM的文本的LLM生成文本检测器。其家族感知学习框架捕获了基础模型及其衍生物之间共享的家族级特征，而不是记忆个体特征。

Conclusion: PhantomHunter在检测来自未见过的、私下调整的LLM的文本方面表现出色，F1分数超过96%。

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization.

Method: We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances.

Conclusion: Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to
GaussianWorld

Motivation: 可靠地区分合成内容和真实镜头的能力已变得既紧迫又重要。现有方法主要将这一挑战视为二元分类任务，对模型识别视频为 AI 生成视频的位置或原因提供的见解有限。核心挑战不仅仅是检测细微的伪影，还需要提供细粒度的、有说服力的证据，以说服审计员和最终用户。

Method: 该研究提出 DAVID-XR1，一种视频语言模型，旨在提供可解释的视觉推理链，包括缺陷分类、时空定位和自然语言解释。

Result: DAVID-XR1 在紧凑的数据集上进行微调，并通过思维链蒸馏得到增强，在各种生成器和生成模式中实现了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了可解释检测方法在可信识别 AI 生成视频内容方面的潜力。

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

Method: Mask Separated Self-Attention机制，Variational Query Denoising技术，自蒸馏策略

Result: MonoVQD在具有挑战性的KITTI单目基准测试中实现了卓越的性能, 在nuScenes数据集上的多视图3D检测场景中也能提供显著的性能提升

Conclusion: MonoVQD在具有挑战性的KITTI单目基准测试中实现了卓越的性能。MonoVQD的核心组件无缝集成到其他架构中，即使在nuScenes数据集上的多视图3D检测场景中也能提供显著的性能提升，并强调了其强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

*Chengzhi Xu,Yuyang Wang,Lai Wei,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartIR, a new method, improves chart-to-code generation by using structured instructions and iterative refinement, outperforming other methods on both open and closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform suboptimally on chart-to-code generation, which requires precise visual understanding and accurate translation of visual elements into structured code.

Method: The paper proposes ChartIR, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction. It decomposes the task into visual understanding and code translation, using description and difference instructions for visual understanding, and performs initial code generation followed by iterative refinement.

Result: The ChartIR method outperforms existing methods on the chart-to-code generation task using both Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o models.

Conclusion: The proposed ChartIR method achieves superior performance on chart-to-code generation compared to other methods, as demonstrated on both open-source and closed-source models.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺的领域中，构建图像分类模型仍然很麻烦，在这些领域中，收集大型标记数据集是不切实际的。先前的工作在很大程度上忽略了基于 ICL 的 FSIC 管道的一个关键组成部分：图像嵌入的作用。

Method: 提出 PictSure，一个 ICL 框架，将嵌入模型置于分析中心。系统地检查了不同视觉编码器类型、预训练目标和微调策略对下游 FSIC 性能的影响。

Result: 训练的成功和领域外性能高度依赖于嵌入模型是如何进行预训练的。

Conclusion: PictSure在与训练分布明显不同的领域外基准测试中，优于现有的基于 ICL 的 FSIC 模型，同时在领域内任务上保持了相当的结果。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

Result: 在 CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-lite、ChestX-ray14 和 GTSRB 数据集上的大量实验表明，与使用统一 3x3 内核的传统模型相比，BKSEF 指导的架构实现了高达 3.1% 的准确率提升和 42.8% 的 FLOPs 降低。两个真实世界的案例研究进一步验证了该方法：一个用于基于云的医疗图像分类，另一个用于边缘设备上的交通标志识别。

Conclusion: BKSEF 提供了一种新的 CNN 优化视角，适用于集成到神经架构搜索管道和实时系统中。

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

*Zhengquan Zhang,Feng Xu,Mengmi Zhang*

TL;DR: A new active view selection (AVS) method uses a neural network to predict uncertainty maps, enabling efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction with fewer viewpoints and less computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction in active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction is a fundamental challenge.

Method: A novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network (UPNet). UPNet learns a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in volumetric representations and aggregates predicted neural uncertainty maps to select the most informative viewpoint.

Result: The method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy with half the viewpoints, up to 400x speedup, and over 50% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods. It also generalizes effectively to AVS tasks involving novel object categories without additional training.

Conclusion: The proposed AVS method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy with half the viewpoints, significantly reduces computational overhead (up to 400x speedup), and generalizes effectively to novel object categories without additional training.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are
publicly released.

Conclusion: PeRL在多图像基准测试上实现了最先进的性能，同时在单图像任务上保持了相当的性能。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Method: A Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range, excluding high- and low-frequency regions. It analyzes the reverse diffusion process, obtains the mid-frequency reconstruction error, and computes the structural similarity index score to determine membership.

Result: FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods on several medical image datasets.

Conclusion: The Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method outperforms existing MIA methods on several medical image datasets.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用ViT架构进行夸克-胶子射流分类的方法，并在公共对撞机数据上建立了性能基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分夸克和胶子引发的射流是高能物理学中一项至关重要且具有挑战性的任务，对于改进大型强子对撞机上的新物理学搜索和精确测量至关重要。虽然深度学习，特别是卷积神经网络（CNN），已经推进了使用基于图像的表示的射流标记，但视觉转换器（ViT）架构的潜力，以建模全局上下文信息而闻名，在很大程度上仍未被探索用于直接量热仪图像分析，尤其是在真实的探测器和堆积条件下。

Method: 使用模拟的2012 CMS开放数据，构建多通道射流视图图像，该图像来自探测器级能量沉积（ECAL，HCAL）和重建的轨迹，从而实现端到端的学习方法。

Result: ViT+MaxViT和ViT+ConvNeXt混合模型始终优于已建立的CNN基线。

Conclusion: ViT及其混合模型在F1分数、ROC-AUC和准确率方面始终优于已建立的CNN基线，突出了捕获射流子结构中远程空间相关性的优势。这项工作建立了第一个系统的框架和稳健的性能基线，用于使用公共对撞机数据将ViT架构应用于基于量热仪图像的射流分类，以及适用于该领域进一步深度学习研究的结构化数据集。

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance detection methods lack portability, scalability, and are unsuitable for robotic applications. Existing neural network approaches suffer from insufficient prediction accuracy.

Method: LRCN and Transformer architectures leveraging RGB tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor GelSight

Result: The proposed models exhibit significant performance improvement over the baseline and accurately estimate compliance. Correlation analysis reveals that objects harder than the sensor are more challenging to estimate.

Conclusion: The proposed LRCN and Transformer models effectively estimate compliance using GelSight sensor data, outperforming the baseline. Objects harder than the sensor are more challenging to estimate.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

*Yijun Lin,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps of a wide variety. It introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features and enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text spotters for historical maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text extraction from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2) training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a rough text region.

Method: PALETTE introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text spotters for historical maps.

Result: PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text.

Conclusion: PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from

Motivation: addresses various issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods and also unifies the framework for different tasks; enabling artist level style transfer and text driven stylization

Method: a semantic-based style injection method that uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of the style image in CLIP space; a data augmentation strategy based on human feedback; a training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the model.

Conclusion: achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image content. Moreover, achieve image color editing during the style transfer process for the first time.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

TL;DR: This paper addresses training instability and codebook collapse in vector quantization by using the Wasserstein distance to align feature and code vector distributions, achieving near 100% codebook utilization and reducing quantization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training instability and codebook collapse. A closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during compression.

Method: employ the Wasserstein distance to align the distributions of the features and code vectors

Result: achieving near 100% codebook utilization and significantly reducing the quantization error

Conclusion: The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by both empirical and theoretical analyses.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap problems due to the limitation of local coordinates.

Method: We propose the Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation, which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor, and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization.

Method: We introduce Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding.

Result: To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision. Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study.

Conclusion: ReSeDis offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at

Method: propose a flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual quality simultaneously within a unified training process.

Result: achieve improved encrypting performance and perceptual quality simultaneously

Conclusion: The proposed scheme is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)

bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality.

Method: a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet)

Result: achieve unified MMIF

Conclusion: The proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code

Conclusion: video-SALMONN 2 模型在视频字幕任务中超越了 GPT-4o 和 Gemini-1.5-Pro 等领先模型，并在常用的视频问答基准测试中保持了与同等规模的最先进模型的竞争性能。

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

TL;DR: RA-NeRF是一种新的方法，即使在复杂的相机轨迹下也能预测高精度的相机姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法试图通过引入外部约束来解决这个问题，但未能达到令人满意的精度，特别是在相机轨迹复杂时。

Method: RA-NeRF使用具有光度一致性的NeRF重建场景，并结合流量驱动的姿态调节来增强初始化和定位过程中的鲁棒性。此外，RA-NeRF采用隐式姿态滤波器来捕获相机运动模式并消除姿态估计的噪声。

Conclusion: RA-NeRF在相机姿态估计和视觉质量方面均实现了最先进的结果，展示了其在复杂姿态轨迹下场景重建的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的迷彩物体检测（COD）方法主要基于静态视觉表示建模的参数化前馈架构，缺乏获取历史上下文的明确机制，限制了它们在处理具有挑战性的迷彩场景时的适应性和有效性。

Method: RetroMem采用两阶段训练范式，包括学习阶段和召回阶段，以有效地构建、更新和利用记忆表征。学习阶段设计密集多尺度适配器（DMA），以提高预训练编码器捕获丰富多尺度视觉信息的能力，同时使用非常少的训练参数，从而提供基础推理。召回阶段提出动态记忆机制（DMM）和推理模式重建（IPR），充分利用学习到的知识和当前样本上下文之间的潜在关系，重建迷彩模式的推理，从而显著提高模型对迷彩场景的理解。

Result: RetroMem显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: RetroMem在多个广泛使用的数据集上显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Time to market and quality are key in the semiconductor sector. Domain Adaptation (DA) minimizes the need for re-labeling or re-training, reducing costs and freeing experts.

Method: A CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms (DBACS).

Result: DA techniques, especially the DBACS approach, are effective in semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the semiconductor field, as validated on real-world Electron Microscope images.

Conclusion: The DBACS approach, a CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms, is effective in advancing DA techniques for the semiconductor field. This was validated on real-world Electron Microscope images in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for
the semiconductor field.

TL;DR: MSNeRV是一种用于神经视频表示的多尺度特征融合框架，它在动态场景中的压缩效率超过了VTM-23.7 (随机存取)，并在基于INR的方法中表现出卓越的表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于INR的方法难以有效地表示细节密集和快速变化的视频内容。这种限制主要源于内部网络特征的未充分利用以及网络设计中缺乏针对视频的考虑。

Method: 我们提出了一个用于神经视频表示的多尺度特征融合框架MSNeRV。在编码阶段，我们通过使用时间窗口来增强时间一致性，并将视频分成多个图片组（GoP），其中GoP级别的网格用于背景表示。此外，我们设计了一个具有尺度自适应损失函数的多尺度空间解码器，以整合多分辨率和多频率信息。为了进一步改进特征提取，我们引入了一个充分利用隐藏特征的多尺度特征块。

Result: 我们的模型在视频表示和压缩方面表现出卓越的表示能力，并在压缩效率方面超过了VTM-23.7 (随机存取)。

Conclusion: MSNeRV在动态场景中的压缩效率超过了VTM-23.7 (随机存取)，并在基于INR的方法中表现出卓越的表示能力。

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Result: BCRNet在L3D和P2ILF数据集上优于现有方法，实现了显著的性能改进。

Conclusion: BCRNet在L3D和P2ILF数据集上优于现有方法，实现了显著的性能改进。

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code

Conclusion: ViMAT demonstrates effectiveness in real-world assembly tasks with uncertain visual observations.

Abstract: Visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks is critical for preventing
equipment damage due to procedural errors and ensuring worker safety. Although
commercial solutions exist, they typically require rigid workspace setups or
the application of visual markers to simplify the problem. We introduce ViMAT,
a novel AI-driven system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks that
operates without these constraints. ViMAT combines a perception module that
extracts visual observations from multi-view video streams with a reasoning
module that infers the most likely action being performed based on the observed
assembly state and prior task knowledge. We validate ViMAT on two assembly
tasks, involving the replacement of LEGO components and the reconfiguration of
hydraulic press molds, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and
qualitative analysis in challenging real-world scenarios characterized by

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating
algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training high-performance models for pathology image classification typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Traditional Active Learning (AL) methods suffer from low annotation efficiency in open-set scenarios with Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data and waste labeling costs due to random selection in the first query round.

Method: novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples.

Result: Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Conclusion: OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine

Conclusion: CountVid provides accurate object counts, and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task

Conclusion: Integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse poses and viewing angles. Experiments on seal and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy.

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,

TL;DR: DDIS是一种新的data-free图像合成方法，它利用扩散模型和领域对齐指导来生成更真实的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源预训练模型在各种应用中具有巨大的潜力，但是当它们的训练数据不可用时，它们的效用就会下降。Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) 旨在生成近似于预训练模型的学习数据分布的图像，而无需访问原始数据。然而，由于缺乏关于自然图像的先验知识，现有的DFIS方法生成的样本偏离了训练数据分布。

Method: DDIS，一种diffusion-assisted data-free图像合成方法，它利用text-to-image diffusion模型作为一个强大的图像先验，从而提高合成图像的质量。为了实现这个目标，我们引入了Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG)，在扩散采样过程中将合成数据域与训练数据域对齐。此外，我们优化了一个单一的Class Alignment Token (CAT)嵌入，以有效地捕捉训练数据集中的类特定属性。

Result: 在PACS和ImageNet上的实验表明，DDIS优于现有的DFIS方法，因为它生成的样本能更好地反映训练数据分布，并在data-free应用中实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DDIS优于现有的DFIS方法，因为它生成的样本能更好地反映训练数据分布，并在data-free应用中实现了SOTA性能。

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces NERO, a neuron-level relevance based method for out-of-distribution detection in medical imaging, which outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods may not fully capture OOD diversity, especially in critical applications like medical imaging where reliability is paramount.

Method: A novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. It clusters neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduces a relevance distance metric. Additionally, it refines performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms.

Result: The NERO method achieves improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across multiple deep learning architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and GastroVision.

Conclusion: The proposed NERO method improves OOD detection performance on gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Conclusion: achieve state-of-the-art results on the publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI generation

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI

TL;DR: RaCalNet uses sparse LiDAR supervision to refine radar measurements, achieving state-of-the-art depth estimation with significantly reduced supervision density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods.

Method: RaCalNet: recalibrates and refines sparse radar points to construct accurate depth priors, which serve as reliable anchors to guide monocular depth prediction.

Result: RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures. reduces RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%, respectively.

Conclusion: RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%, respectively.

without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural

Conclusion: WinWinLay在控制元素布局和实现逼真的视觉保真度方面表现出色，优于当前最先进的方法。

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new graph-based framework for large-scale forest AGB estimation using QSM, overcoming limitations of existing methods and enabling end-to-end processing with ULS data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Current QSM methods face significant limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees, depend on high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical deployment.

Method: This study presents a novel unified framework that enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree segmentation, leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error).

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation, reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools, and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to TLS. It improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双LoRA学习(DLoRAL)范式，用于训练一个有效的基于sd的单步扩散模型，从而同时实现真实的帧细节和时间一致性。


<details>

Motivation: 在真实世界的视频超分辨率(Real-VSR)中，如何在保持时间一致性的同时再现丰富的空间细节是一个具有挑战性的问题，特别是当我们利用预先训练的生成模型(如stable diffusion (SD))进行真实的细节合成时。现有的基于sd的Real-VSR方法通常会牺牲空间细节来换取时间连贯性，从而导致次优的视觉质量。我们认为，关键在于如何有效地从低质量(LQ)输入视频中提取出鲁棒的退化时间一致性先验，并在保持提取的一致性先验的同时增强视频细节。

Method: 我们提出了一种双LoRA学习(DLoRAL)范式来训练一个有效的基于sd的单步扩散模型，从而同时实现真实的帧细节和时间一致性。具体来说，我们引入了一个跨帧检索(CFR)模块来聚合跨帧的补充信息，并训练一个一致性-LoRA (c-LoRA)来学习来自退化输入的鲁棒时间表示。在一致性学习之后，我们固定CFR和c-LoRA模块，并训练一个细节-LoRA (d-LoRA)来增强空间细节，同时与c-LoRA定义的时间空间对齐，以保持时间连贯性。这两个阶段迭代交替进行优化，协同提供一致和细节丰富的输出。在推理过程中，两个LoRA分支被合并到SD模型中，从而在单个扩散步骤中实现高效和高质量的视频恢复。

Result: 实验表明，DLoRAL在准确性和速度方面都取得了强大的性能。

Conclusion: DLoRAL在准确性和速度方面都取得了强大的性能。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

*Kyobin Choo,Hyunkyung Han,Jinyeong Kim,Chanyong Yoon,Seong Jae Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为M2M-Reg的新框架，用于多模态可变形图像配准，该框架使用单模态相似性训练模型，并在ADNI数据集上实现了更高的配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于与标准结构扫描相比，这些模态的极端异质性，传统的无监督DIR方法难以学习可靠的空间映射，并且经常扭曲图像。指导这些模型的相似性度量无法捕获高度不同的模态之间的对齐。

Method: M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration)，一种新颖的框架，它仅使用单模态相似性来训练多模态DIR模型，同时保留已建立的架构范例，以无缝集成到现有模型中。还引入了GradCyCon，它利用M2M-Reg的循环训练方案来促进微分同胚。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病神经影像计划（ADNI）数据集上的实验表明，M2M-Reg在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准方面比以前的方法实现了高达2倍的DSC。

Conclusion: M2M-Reg在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准方面比以前的方法实现了高达2倍的DSC，突出了其在处理高度异构多模态DIR方面的有效性。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 我们提出了一个用于实时 3D 对象检测的无重建在线框架，该框架在 ScanNetV2 和 CA-1M 数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇 3D 对象检测因其在自动驾驶和具身人工智能中的关键应用而备受关注。现有的检测方法，无论是离线还是在线，通常依赖于密集的点云重建，这会带来大量的计算开销和内存限制，从而阻碍了下游任务中的实时部署。为了解决这个问题

Method: 我们提出了一个新颖的无重建在线框架，该框架专为内存高效的实时 3D 检测而定制。具体来说，给定流式姿势 RGB-D 视频输入，我们利用 Cubify Anything 作为预训练的视觉基础模型 (VFM)，通过边界框进行单视图 3D 对象检测，并结合 CLIP 来捕获检测对象的开放词汇语义。为了将跨不同视图检测到的所有边界框融合为一个统一的边界框，我们采用关联模块来实现多视图的对应关系，并采用优化模块来融合在多视图中预测的同一实例的 3D 边界框。关联模块利用 3D 非极大值抑制 (NMS) 和框对应匹配模块，而优化模块使用基于粒子滤波的 IoU 引导的高效随机优化技术，以增强 3D 边界框的多视图一致性，同时最大限度地降低计算复杂性。

Result: 我们的方法在在线方法中实现了最先进的性能。受益于这种用于 3D 对象检测的新型无重建范例，我们的方法在各种场景中都表现出出色的泛化能力，即使在超过 1000 平方米的环境中也能实现实时感知。

Conclusion: 在 ScanNetV2 和 CA-1M 数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在在线方法中实现了最先进的性能。受益于这种用于 3D 对象检测的新型无重建范例，该方法在各种场景中都表现出出色的泛化能力，即使在超过 1000 平方米的环境中也能实现实时感知。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

TL;DR: HOIDiNi 是一种文本驱动的扩散框架，用于合成逼真且合理的人与对象交互 (HOI)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HOI 生成极具挑战性，因为它需要在多样化的运动流形中实现严格的接触精度。当前文献在真实感和物理正确性之间进行权衡。

Method: HOIDiNi 使用扩散噪声优化 (DNO) 在预训练扩散模型的噪声空间中直接优化。

Result: 在 GRAB 数据集上的定量、定性和主观评估清楚地表明，HOIDiNi 在接触精度、物理有效性和整体质量方面优于现有技术和基线。

Conclusion: HOIDiNi 能够仅通过文本提示生成复杂、可控的交互，包括抓取、放置和全身协调。

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating long-term memory in embodied agents and presents baseline results using state-of-the-art VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large vision-language models for reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate long-term experience. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. Existing long-video QA benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past interactions.

Method: introducing a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator and present baselines that integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies

Result: assessing their performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for improvement

Conclusion: This work introduces a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for improvement.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

*Shuo Xing,Lanqing Guo,Hongyuan Hua,Seoyoung Lee,Peiran Li,Yufei Wang,Zhangyang Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs don't always perform better with high-quality images. A new method, VQ-TTT, adapts images to improve MLLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates how input visual quality shapes the responses of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), questioning whether higher perceptual quality translates to better understanding.

Method: The study applies controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to images and introduces Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT), a lightweight adaptation module with a learnable low-rank kernel and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: The study uncovers a visual-quality paradox where MLLM performance improves with images of lower human-perceived fidelity. VQ-TTT significantly improves average accuracy across evaluated MLLMs and datasets.

Conclusion: The study finds that MLLM performance can improve with images that deviate from human-perceived fidelity, and introduces VQ-TTT to adaptively adjust images for task-specific model preferences, achieving significant accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

TL;DR: ViMaR is a fast and accurate two-stage inference framework for vision-language models that improves efficiency, output fidelity, and allows self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time search approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) are computationally expensive and prone to hallucinations due to low-confidence generations.

Method: Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR), a two-stage inference framework that combines a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment.

Result: ViMaR achieves over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods and improves caption quality. ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA Mistral-7B, generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model. Adapting the ViMaR to steer generation in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. When ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks.

Conclusion: ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. Furthermore, when ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving VLM pipelines.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

Motivation: 现有的端到端重新照明模型通常受到配对的多照明数据稀缺的限制，限制了它们在不同场景中推广的能力。相反，结合逆向和正向渲染的两阶段管道可以减少数据需求，但容易出现误差累积，并且在复杂的光照条件或复杂的材料下通常无法产生真实的输出。

Conclusion: 该模型在不同领域表现出强大的泛化能力，并在视觉保真度和时间一致性方面超越了以往的方法。

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Method: 提出了ECAD，一种遗传算法，可以学习高效的、每个模型的缓存策略，形成帕累托前沿，仅使用一小组校准提示。

Result: 在PixArt-alpha上，ECAD识别出的时间表比之前的最先进方法提高了4.47 COCO FID，同时将推理加速从2.35倍提高到2.58倍。在PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, 和 FLUX-1.dev上使用多个指标在不同的基准上进行了评估，证明了相对于以前方法的持续改进。

Conclusion: ECAD是一种可扩展且通用的加速扩散推理的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

*Maxwell J. Jacobson,Corey J. Maley,Yexiang Xue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CALM结合了符号推理和神经生成，使系统能够根据真实世界的多模态数据做出上下文相关的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的二值逻辑系统无法捕捉人类决策的细微差别。它们还需要在多模态环境中进行人工接地，这可能是临时的、僵化的和脆弱的。神经网络擅长从多模态数据中提取丰富的上下文信息，但缺乏用于推理的可解释结构。

Method: CALM使用域树表示每个谓词，当确定其实体的上下文基础时，域树迭代地细化其模拟真值。迭代细化由能够捕获多模态信息的神经网络预测，并通过符号推理模块进行过滤，以确保满足约束。

Result: 在完形填空对象放置任务中，CALM达到了92.2%的准确率，优于经典逻辑(86.3%)和LLM(59.4%)基线。它还展示了与逻辑约束和微妙的人类偏好相一致的空间热图生成，正如一项人类研究表明的那样。

Conclusion: CALM展示了在多模态环境中利用逻辑结构进行推理并与偏好对齐的潜力。它为需要逻辑的精确性和解释以及神经网络的多模态信息处理的下一代人工智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).
CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make
context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human
decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,
which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting
rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable
structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,
creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this
integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to
generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate
to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which
iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of
its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural
networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a
symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%
accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It
also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints
and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure
while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the
foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and
interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural
networks.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly
impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL
and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to
scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical
for CMARL on MEAL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.  Low hardware utilization is also an inherent drawback of fully synchronized long-generation procedures.

Method: Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy update and length-restricted response generation. It also includes Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) and a computationally optimized mechanism for independent optimization of policy and value models.

Result: T-PPO improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and outperforms its existing competitors on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model.

Conclusion: T-PPO improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and outperforms its existing competitors.

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

Motivation: 传统的设计严重依赖于手动专业知识，并且难以在不同的实例中推广。我们引入了HeurAgenix。

Method: HeurAgenix，一个由大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的两阶段超启发式框架，该框架首先进化启发式算法，然后在它们之间自动选择。

Result: HeurAgenix不仅优于现有的基于LLM的超启发式算法，而且匹配或超过了专门的求解器。

Conclusion: HeurAgenix在典型基准测试中不仅优于现有的基于LLM的超启发式算法，而且匹配或超过了专门的求解器。

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Conclusion: MARL可以有效地平衡成像和资源管理，同时解决多卫星协调中的非平稳性和奖励相互依赖性。该研究的见解为自主卫星操作奠定了基础，为改进分散式EO任务中的策略学习提供了实用的指导。

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

Conclusion: 提出了异构智能体软演员-评论员算法，通过仿真验证了其在解决计算卸载和资源分配方面的有效性。

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

Conclusion: The proposed Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN) consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. The Causal Understanding Module generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

### [125] [The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic Routing Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15624)
*Lyle Goodyear,Rachel Guo,Ramesh Johari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agent behavior depends on the natural language state representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior and limits comparability between studies.

Method: We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language state representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games and apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game.

Result: Representations which provide agents with summarized history, regret information, and limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents.

Conclusion: LLM agent behavior depends on the natural language state representation. Representations with summarized history, regret information, and limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

TL;DR: LRMs overthink, leading to inefficiency. The paper introduces two methods, Efficiency Steering and Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, to reduce reasoning length and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often exhibit overthinking, which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost.

Method: Efficiency Steering, a training-free activation steering technique and Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework

Result: Our methods significantly reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance.

Conclusion: Reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: Next-User Retrieval, a novel framework using generative next-user modeling, enhances cold-start recommendations, achieving significant improvements in user engagement and content publication on Douyin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern recommendation systems struggle with item cold-start challenges due to reliance on item and historical interactions, and limitations in traditional lookalike algorithms.

Method: A transformer-based model captures unidirectional relationships among recently interacted users to generate the next potential user, with item features integrated as prefix prompt embeddings.

Result: Offline experiments and online A/B tests show significant improvements, including a 0.0142% increase in daily active users and a +0.1144% increase in publications on Douyin.

Conclusion: The proposed Next-User Retrieval framework enhances cold-start recommendations and demonstrates practical applicability and scalability with significant improvements in daily active users and publications on Douyin.

Abstract: The item cold-start problem is critical for online recommendation systems, as
the success of this phase determines whether high-quality new items can
transition to popular ones, receive essential feedback to inspire creators, and
thus lead to the long-term retention of creators. However, modern
recommendation systems still struggle to address item cold-start challenges due
to the heavy reliance on item and historical interactions, which are
non-trivial for cold-start items lacking sufficient exposure and feedback.
Lookalike algorithms provide a promising solution by extending feedback for new
items based on lookalike users. Traditional lookalike algorithms face such
limitations: (1) failing to effectively model the lookalike users and further
improve recommendations with the existing rule- or model-based methods; and (2)
struggling to utilize the interaction signals and incorporate diverse features
in modern recommendation systems.
  Inspired by lookalike algorithms, we propose Next-User Retrieval, a novel
framework for enhancing cold-start recommendations via generative next-user
modeling. Specifically, we employ a transformer-based model to capture the
unidirectional relationships among recently interacted users and utilize these
sequences to generate the next potential user who is most likely to interact
with the item. The additional item features are also integrated as prefix
prompt embeddings to assist the next-user generation. The effectiveness of
Next-User Retrieval is evaluated through both offline experiments and online
A/B tests. Our method achieves significant improvements with increases of
0.0142% in daily active users and +0.1144% in publications in Douyin,
showcasing its practical applicability and scalability.

TL;DR: This paper surveys multi-interest recommendation, addressing its importance, aspects, applications, and provides a framework for researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommendation methods often struggle to model users' multifaceted preferences due to the diversity and volatility of user behavior, as well as the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of item attributes in practical scenarios.

Method: systematically review the progress, solutions, challenges, and future directions of multi-interest recommendation

Result: Helps understand why multi-interest modeling is important, what aspects are focused on, and how it can be applied.

Conclusion: This survey establishes a fundamental framework and delivers a preliminary overview for researchers interested in multi-interest recommendation.

Abstract: Existing recommendation methods often struggle to model users' multifaceted
preferences due to the diversity and volatility of user behavior, as well as
the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of item attributes in practical
scenarios. Multi-interest recommendation addresses this challenge by extracting
multiple interest representations from users' historical interactions, enabling
fine-grained preference modeling and more accurate recommendations. It has
drawn broad interest in recommendation research. However, current
recommendation surveys have either specialized in frontier recommendation
methods or delved into specific tasks and downstream applications. In this
work, we systematically review the progress, solutions, challenges, and future
directions of multi-interest recommendation by answering the following three
questions: (1) Why is multi-interest modeling significantly important for
recommendation? (2) What aspects are focused on by multi-interest modeling in
recommendation? and (3) How can multi-interest modeling be applied, along with
the technical details of the representative modules? We hope that this survey
establishes a fundamental framework and delivers a preliminary overview for
researchers interested in this field and committed to further exploration. The
implementation of multi-interest recommendation summarized in this survey is

*Chang Liu,Yimeng Bai,Xiaoyan Zhao,Yang Zhang,Fuli Feng,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DiscRec addresses token-item misalignment and signal entanglement in generative recommendation by disentangling semantic and collaborative signals, leading to improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative recommendation methods face challenges due to token-item misalignment and semantic-collaborative signal entanglement.

Method: DiscRec, a novel framework with item-level position embeddings and a dual-branch module for disentangled semantic-collaborative signal modeling with flexible fusion.

Result: DiscRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DiscRec effectively decouples semantic and collaborative signals, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on four real-world datasets.

Abstract: Generative recommendation is emerging as a powerful paradigm that directly
generates item predictions, moving beyond traditional matching-based
approaches. However, current methods face two key challenges: token-item
misalignment, where uniform token-level modeling ignores item-level granularity
that is critical for collaborative signal learning, and semantic-collaborative
signal entanglement, where collaborative and semantic signals exhibit distinct
distributions yet are fused in a unified embedding space, leading to
conflicting optimization objectives that limit the recommendation performance.
  To address these issues, we propose DiscRec, a novel framework that enables
Disentangled Semantic-Collaborative signal modeling with flexible fusion for
generative Recommendation.First, DiscRec introduces item-level position
embeddings, assigned based on indices within each semantic ID, enabling
explicit modeling of item structure in input token sequences.Second, DiscRec
employs a dual-branch module to disentangle the two signals at the embedding
layer: a semantic branch encodes semantic signals using original token
embeddings, while a collaborative branch applies localized attention restricted
to tokens within the same item to effectively capture collaborative signals. A
gating mechanism subsequently fuses both branches while preserving the model's
ability to model sequential dependencies. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets demonstrate that DiscRec effectively decouples these
signals and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our codes are
available on https://github.com/Ten-Mao/DiscRec.

Motivation: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the complexities of real-world medical practice.

Method: We propose a hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step, interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants.

Result: Results show open-source LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs hold promise as physician assistants, but further validation with real physician interactions is needed to assess MedSyn's impact on diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,

static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) that improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. Practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak.

Method: We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths.

Result: 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas.

Conclusion: The 2D-PT method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

TL;DR: NetraAI, a dynamical system-based AI, uses a novel approach with an LLM strategist to identify patient subgroups and improve clinical discovery, achieving near-perfect classification in case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper analyzes DeepSeek-V3, a large language model, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based framework, highlighting the evolution of AI into specialized species.

Method: NetraAI combines contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient cohorts. An LLM Strategist acts as a meta-evolutionary layer, observing Persona outputs, prioritizing variables, injecting domain knowledge, and assessing robustness.

Result: NetraAI uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline models into near-perfect classifiers in case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer).

Conclusion: NetraAI offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical discovery by prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Motivation: 确定迎流参数对于风洞测试、常规飞行和风力涡轮机运行至关重要。传统上，这些参数是通过直接测量来预测的，但在传感器出现故障时可能会带来挑战。或者，可以使用基于表面压力数据的data-driven预测模型来确定这些参数。这种预测器必须实现接近实时的学习，这对于监测风洞运行或了解航空航天和风能系统的空气动力性能变化等实际应用至关重要。

Result: 结果成功地证明了该方法在适应变化的数据分布、扩展域和任务更新方面的潜力，而对于噪声数据的应用则被认为效果不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在适应变化的数据分布、扩展域和任务更新方面具有潜力，但对于噪声数据的应用效果不佳。

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

TL;DR: This paper uses deep reinforcement learning to solve the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations, achieving better performance than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution, but these systems encounter challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages, and conventional approaches restrict flexibility.

Method: The authors propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework with a graph-based state representation and a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model.

Result: The proposed approach can be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts, and it outperforms heuristic methods in optimizing retrieval tardiness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with heuristic methods.

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

Motivation: 高质量的真实世界数据集对于推进1型糖尿病（T1D）管理中数据驱动的方法至关重要，包括个性化治疗设计、数字孪生系统和葡萄糖预测模型。然而，由于缺乏提供详细和全面的患者数据的公开可用数据集，该领域的进展受到了限制。

Method: 我们提出了AZT1D，这是一个包含从25名使用自动胰岛素输送（AID）系统的T1D患者收集的数据集。

Result: AZT1D包括连续血糖监测（CGM）数据、胰岛素泵和胰岛素给药数据、碳水化合物摄入量以及设备模式（常规、睡眠和运动），每个患者的数据收集时间为6至8周。值得注意的是，该数据集提供了有关大剂量胰岛素输送的详细信息（即，总剂量、大剂量类型、校正特定量），这些特征在现有数据集中很少见。

Conclusion: AZT1D数据集通过提供丰富的、自然的数据，支持广泛的人工智能和机器学习应用，旨在改善T1D的临床决策和个体化护理。

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven
approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy
design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress
in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets
that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we
present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D
on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,
carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained
over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

*Tianxiang Zhan,Ming Jin,Yuanpeng He,Yuxuan Liang,Yong Deng,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CEP retains all conceptual knowledge and fully utilize it when the concepts recur to enhance the prediction results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurring concept drift leads to a decline in the accuracy of online predictions because previously encountered concepts are forgotten. Existing solutions employ parameter updating techniques to delay forgetting, but this may result in the loss of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of knowledge retention mechanisms.

Method: The Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for different concepts. The method selects the forecaster nearest to the test sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept. Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be cleared.

Result: CEP effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the prediction results.

Conclusion: CEP effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts and significantly enhances the prediction results in the scenario of online forecasting with recurring concepts.

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

Motivation: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness).

Method: Injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output akin to Monte-Carlo dropout.

Result: A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

Conclusion: Injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

*Henrik Klagges,Robert Dahlke,Fabian Klemm,Benjamin Merkel,Daniel Klingmann,David A. Reiss,Dan Zecha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Assembly-of-Experts (AoE), a method to create child models from Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. A 671B hybrid model, Chimera, was created using this method, achieving R1-level intelligence with 40% fewer output tokens and compact reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models

Method: We develop the new "Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress semantic features of the parents.

Result: We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.

Conclusion: Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.

TL;DR: A fundamental limit on the tradeoff between structured and selective internal representations is exposed. Theory and experiments clarify how semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and brains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are simultaneously structured and selective, but there is a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.

Method: deriving closed-form expressions and minimal ReLU network

Result: probability of correct generalization and identification to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry

Conclusion: semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and brains

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

Conclusion: ss-Mamba在时间序列预测中表现出卓越的准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性，是一种通用的、计算效率高的Transformer模型的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal

Motivation: Determine whether VLMs inherit the instability of LLMs to varying prompts, given that VLMs integrate visual modalities with LLMs, which are known to be prompt-sensitive.

Method: Introduce PARC, a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees, and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt variation analysis.

Result: PARC's evaluation shows VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most destructive variations change the expected answer. Robust VLMs come from the InternVL2 family. Prompt sensitivity is linked to training data.

Conclusion: VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most destructive variations change the expected answer. Outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2 family. Prompt sensitivity is linked to training data.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases. DXA scans are costly and time-consuming, and most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive, requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we implemented a semi-supervised model

Method: Applying statistical and machine learning models on biomarkers obtained from 3D optical images, implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model.

Result: The $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM, $\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for 10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of $\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with $\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data.

Conclusion: The p-Laplacian model is a promising tool for healthcare applications, particularly in a data-constrained environment. SVR performed the best for ALM and BMD, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP when trained on 80 percent of the data.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support

having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文重点研究具有一些负样本可用的小规模单类分类。

Method: 广义参考核与负样本 (GRKneg) 用于单类支持向量机 (OC-SVM)。

Result: 该方法始终优于使用径向基函数核的标准 OC-SVM。当有大量负样本时，二元 SVM 优于预期中的单类方法，但我们表明，对于最少数量的负样本，所提出的方法明显优于二元 SVM。

Conclusion: 在负样本数量最少的情况下，该方法明显优于二元 SVM。

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

### [160] [Event-Driven Online Vertical Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14911)
*Ganyu Wang,Boyu Wang,Bin Gu,Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个事件驱动的在线VFL框架，以解决现有在线VFL框架在非平稳数据条件下不稳定，通信和计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线学习更适应垂直联邦学习(VFL)中的真实场景，但将其整合到VFL中存在挑战，因为VFL中的客户拥有同一样本的非相交特征集。在实际场景中，客户可能无法同步接收同一实体的非相交特征的数据流。相反，数据通常由仅与一部分客户相关的“事件”生成。之前的研究忽略了在线VFL中的这些挑战。

Method: 该论文提出了一个事件驱动的在线VFL框架，并结合了动态局部后悔(DLR)到VFL中。

Result: 大量的实验表明，该论文提出的框架比现有的在线VFL框架在非平稳数据条件下更稳定，同时显著降低了通信和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的事件驱动的在线VFL框架在非平稳数据条件下比现有的在线VFL框架更稳定，同时显著降低了通信和计算成本。

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

TL;DR: FedOne improves query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning by activating only one client per round, addressing the high query costs of cloud-based LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research on federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost associated with cloud-based LLM services.

Method: Theoretical analysis of query efficiency and the FedOne framework.

Result: FedOne enables optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning. Numerical experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in query efficiency.

Conclusion: The FedOne framework significantly improves query efficiency in federated black-box discrete prompt learning, aligning with theoretical results.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

Motivation: Digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection process.

*Flavio Martinelli,Alexander Van Meegen,Berfin Şimşek,Wulfram Gerstner,Johanni Brea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies and characterizes channels in the loss landscape of neural networks where the loss decreases slowly and neurons diverge. These channels lead to gated linear units and are reached by common optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation.

Method: Identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other.

Result: At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points.

Conclusion: Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Guru, a new RL reasoning corpus, and uses it to train Guru-7B and Guru-32B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance in general reasoning. The study finds that RL effectiveness varies across domains and can facilitate genuine skill acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains, limiting the understanding of RL's broader applicability to general reasoning in LLMs. Most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code.

Method: The paper introduces Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains, each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering.

Result: The paper observes significant variation across domains. Domains frequently seen during pretraining easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains. This suggests that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on a 17-task evaluation suite. The models improve Pass@k performance, especially on complex tasks. Data, models, and code are released.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate

### [165] [ODD: Overlap-aware Estimation of Model Performance under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14978)
*Aayush Mishra,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD) to improve error estimation of ML models in unseen test domains by focusing on the non-overlapping target domain, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test domains is important. Prior work using disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) has a problem where the disagreement objective competes in the overlapping region between source and target domains.

Method: The paper devises Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD) by maximizing disagreement only in the non-overlapping target domain, using domain-classifiers to estimate domain-overlap.

Result: The ODD-based bound better predicts target performance than DIS^2.

Conclusion: The proposed ODD method improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and reliable, as demonstrated through experiments on various benchmarks.

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

Motivation: 由于疾病异质性，早期多发性硬化症（MS）的残疾进展预测具有挑战性。

Method: 采用了最先进的表格和时间序列基础模型（FMs），一个定制的基于多模态注意力的transformer，以及机器学习方法。

Result: 尽管早期预测很困难（AUROC 0.63），但通过先进模型整合数字数据提高了仅使用临床数据的性能。来自Moment FM的单模态嵌入的transformer模型产生了最佳结果，但我们的多模态transformer始终优于其单模态对应模型，证实了将临床数据与数字数据相结合的优势。

Conclusion: FMs和多模态方法有希望从复杂和多样化的临床和数字生命科学数据中提取预测信号，从而为MS和潜在的其他复杂疾病提供更准确的预后。

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week
disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital
Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed
state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom
multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite
the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via
advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer
model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but
our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance in a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework.

Method: A novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation; a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound in the offline setting; an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness in the online setting.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at
ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system
performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited
information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing
framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

Motivation: 在脓毒症治疗中，强化学习依赖于从不规则的ICU时间序列中学习稳定的、临床上有意义的状态表征。以往的研究忽略了序列表征中训练不稳定性及其对策略性能的有害影响这一关键挑战。

Method: 使用受控微分方程（CDE）

Result: 稳定的CDE自编码器产生的表征与病情严重程度评分密切相关，并实现了卓越的强化学习策略性能。不稳定的CDE表征导致降级的表征和策略失败。稳定的CDE不仅分离了幸存者和非幸存者的轨迹，还揭示了清晰的病情严重程度评分梯度，而不稳定的训练未能捕捉到这两种模式。

Conclusion: 稳定的CDE表征能够产生与临床评分强烈相关的表征，并实现卓越性能的强化学习策略，而不稳定的CDE表征会导致降级的表征和策略失败。强调了在序列表征学习中训练稳定性的必要性。

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

TL;DR: SFT-GO improves SFT by grouping tokens based on importance and weighting the loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains critical, task-specific information.

Method: Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance. SFT-GO groups tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard cross-entropy loss.

Result: SFT-GO consistently outperform baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: Models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the effectiveness of the method.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

### [170] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the impact of vocabulary size on LLM training, identifies a Large Vocab (LV) regime with different optimal learning rate scaling rules compared to μP, and validates the theory with experiments, including pretraining a 1B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the conflicting observations of μP when applied to LLMs and the limitation of μP theory that considers input dimension fixed.

Method: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics.

Result: The analysis reveals that in the Large Vocab (LV) regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should scale as Θ(√width), different from the Θ(width) ratio predicted by μP.

Conclusion: The paper validates the proposed theory through experiments and pretrains a 1B model to demonstrate the benefits of the suggested scaling rule for embedding LR.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation remains less understood.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\\mathcal{K}$ family of optimizers.

Result: Show that Muon corresponds to Lion-$\\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and leverage the theoretical results of Lion-$\\mathcal{K}$.

Conclusion: Muon (with decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. Generalizations are possible through varying the choice of convex map.

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地被用作具身代理的认知核心。然而，源于未能将用户指令扎根于观察到的物理环境中的继承性幻觉，可能导致导航错误，例如搜索不存在的冰箱。

Method: 构建了一个幻觉探测集，能够诱导比基本提示高 40 倍的幻觉率。评估了两个模拟环境中的 12 个模型。

Conclusion: 模型在处理场景-任务不一致时存在根本性限制，无法解决这些不一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

Motivation: 现代智能交通系统依赖于精确的时空交通分析来优化城市交通和基础设施弹性。然而，传感器故障和异构传感间隙导致普遍存在的数据缺失从根本上阻碍了可靠的交通建模。

Method: 神经规范 Polyadic 分解 (NCPF) 模型，该模型将低秩张量代数与深度表示学习相结合，以实现稳健的交通数据插补。

Result: 在六个城市交通数据集上的广泛评估表明，NCPF 优于六个最先进的基线。

Conclusion: NCPF 通过结合 CP 分解的可解释因子分析与神经网络的非线性表达能力，为高维交通数据插补提供了一种原则性但灵活的方法，为下一代交通数字孪生和自适应交通控制系统提供关键支持。

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

Motivation: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance, machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique. However, a fundamental challenge lies in effectively verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly executed. Existing approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.

Method: This paper proposes a taxonomy that organizes current techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess unlearning fidelity. The paper also examines representative methods within each category and analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations.

Result: This paper presents the first structured survey of machine unlearning verification methods. The paper identifies potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment.

Conclusion: This paper articulates a set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded unlearning verification mechanisms.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ImprovDML，一种去中心化的DML框架，可在保证隐私和抵抗拜占庭攻击的同时，实现高模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式机器学习（DML）中，共同解决拜占庭攻击和隐私泄露问题已成为一个重要问题。一种常见的策略是将拜占庭弹性聚合规则与差分隐私机制相结合。然而，这些技术的结合通常会导致模型精度的显着下降。为了解决这个问题

Method: 该框架利用一种弹性向量共识算法，该算法可以计算正常（非拜占庭）代理的凸包内的点，以便在每次迭代中进行弹性聚合。然后，将多元高斯噪声引入梯度以进行隐私保护。

Result: 我们提供了收敛保证，并在非凸设置下导出了渐近学习误差界限，这些界限比现有工作中报告的更严格。对于隐私分析，我们采用了集中地理隐私的概念，该概念基于输入之间的欧几里德距离来量化隐私保护。我们证明，与差分隐私相比，它可以改善隐私保护和模型准确性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 这篇论文提出了一个名为ImprovDML的去中心化DML框架，该框架实现了高模型精度，同时确保了隐私保护和对拜占庭攻击的弹性。数值模拟验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物灵活地重组一组有限的核心运动原语以满足不同的任务需求，但现有的行为分割方法通过在限制性生成假设下施加离散音节来过度简化这一过程。

Method: 引入了一种基于技能的模仿学习 (SKIL) 用于行为理解，这是一种基于强化学习的模仿框架，该框架 (1) 通过利用过渡概率的表示学习来推断可解释的技能集，即行为的潜在基函数，以及 (2) 将策略参数化为这些技能的动态组合。

Result: 在各项任务中，它可以识别可重用的技能组件，学习不断发展的组合策略，并生成超出传统离散模型能力的真实轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法通过组合表示形式利用生成行为建模，简洁、有原则地解释了复杂动物行为如何从基本运动原语的动态组合中产生。

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

### [180] [Singular Value Decomposition on Kronecker Adaptation for Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15251)
*Yee Hin Chong,Peng Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SoKA的参数高效微调策略，该策略在减少参数数量的同时，实现了与现有技术相当甚至更优越的性能，并且具有更快的收敛速度和更稳定的梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练Transformer模型在各种语言和推理任务中取得了最先进的结果，但完全微调会产生大量的存储、内存和计算开销。参数高效微调（PEFT）方法通过仅学习一小部分特定于任务的参数来降低这些成本，但现有方法要么引入推理时延迟（适配器模块），要么遭受次优收敛（随机初始化的低秩更新），要么依赖于可能与任务复杂性不匹配的固定秩选择（基于Kronecker的分解）。

Method: 提出了一种新的PEFT策略SoKA（Kronecker Adaptation上的SVD），它结合了Kronecker积张量分解与SVD驱动的初始化和频谱感知动态秩选择。

Result: SoKA需要的可训练参数更少，同时达到或超过基线性能，并且表现出更快的收敛速度和更稳定的梯度。

Conclusion: SoKA在算术推理（GSM8K）、形式数学（MATH）和代码生成（MBPP）方面，仅需0.99M可训练参数，比LoRA/PiSSA少25%，同时达到或超过基线性能。此外，SoKA表现出更快的收敛速度和更稳定的梯度，突出了其在大规模模型适应方面的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

TL;DR: 研究了联邦学习在拜占庭条件下的鲁棒性，发现在盒有效性下，质心近似的下界为$\min{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}}$，上限为$2\min{n,\sqrt{d}}$。

Motivation: 研究联邦学习是否对拜占庭行为具有鲁棒性

Method: 提出了一种新的算法，该算法在凸有效性下实现了$\\\\sqrt{2d}$-近似

Result: 在盒有效性下，质心近似的下界为$\\\\min{\\\{\frac{n-t}{t},\\\sqrt{d}\\\}}$，上限为$2\\min{\\\{n,\\\sqrt{d}\\\}}$。在凸有效性下实现了$\\\\sqrt{2d}$-近似

Conclusion: 对联邦学习中的拜占庭行为的鲁棒性进行了研究，并观察和调查了平均/质心与分布式计算中的有效性条件之间的权衡。结果表明，各种有效性条件本身并不能保证平均值的良好近似。此外，由于可能的拜占庭异常值，达到良好的近似值并不能在实验环境中给出良好的结果。本文的主要贡献是在盒有效性下，质心近似的下界为$\\\min{\\\{\frac{n-t}{t},\\\sqrt{d}\\\}}$，其中$n$是客户端的数量，$t$是拜占庭错误数量的上限，$d$是机器学习模型的维度。通过为$n<d$的情况提供新的分析，补充了$2\\min{\\\{n,\\\sqrt{d}\\\}}$的上限。此外，提出了一种新的算法，该算法在凸有效性下实现了$\\\\sqrt{2d}$-近似，这也证明了文献中现有的下界是紧的。结果表明，所有提出的界限也可以在分布式点对点环境中实现。通过联邦随机梯度下降和联邦平均设置中的实证评估来补充分析结果。

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to synthetically generate held-out datasets for Dataset Inference, allowing for the detection of unauthorized data usage in LLM training and empowering copyright owners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DI methods require a private set that closely matches the compromised dataset's distribution, which is rarely available in practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. The unauthorized use of data scraped from the internet for training LLMs violates data owners' intellectual property rights.

Method: The approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which is achieved via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration.

Result: Using the generated data as a held-out set enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while maintaining a low false positive rate.

Conclusion: This work addresses the challenge of Dataset Inference (DI) by synthetically generating the required held-out set, enabling copyright owners to make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrating the method's reliability for real-world litigations. Extensive experiments show that using the generated data as a held-out set enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while maintaining a low false positive rate.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DOVA-PATBM, a GNN-driven framework, optimises EV charger deployment, improving coverage, equity, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.

Method: a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.

Result: increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs.

Conclusion: a tightly integrated, GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy

Motivation: Financing remains a critical challenge for SMEs in cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) due to limited credit histories. Third-party logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) offers a solution, but requires advanced credit risk management.

Method: We leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) and integrate it with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM).

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit risk assessment and loan size determination.

Conclusion: This study pioneers the application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, providing a foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为有效导航复杂的多重药理学领域提供了一个通用路线图。

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习（ICL）中利用未标记数据的问题，发现多层或循环Transformer可以通过隐式构造特定形式的估计器来有效地利用未标记数据，并且所提出的方法在半监督表格学习中表现出色。

Motivation: 最近的研究表明，即使演示具有缺失或不正确的标签，上下文学习（ICL）也可能是有效的。为了阐明这种能力，我们研究了一个规范设置，其中演示是根据二元高斯混合模型（GMM）绘制的，并且一定比例的演示具有缺失的标签。

Method: 我们提供了一个全面的理论研究，以表明：（1）单层线性注意力模型的损失面恢复了最优的完全监督估计器，但完全未能利用未标记数据；（2）相比之下，多层或循环Transformer可以有效地利用未标记数据。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛评估表明，我们的方法显着提高了标准单次推理的半监督表格学习性能。

Conclusion: Multilayer或循环Transformer可以通过隐式构造$\\sum_{i\\ge 0} a_i (X^\\top X)^iX^\\top y$形式的估计器来有效地利用未标记数据，其中$X$和$y$表示特征和部分观察到的标签（缺失条目设置为零）。

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Motivation: Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing values.

Method: We formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type embeddings only.

Result: The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the tabular domain.

Conclusion: We achieve an improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Motivation: Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods increase energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures, which are crucial for stable MD simulations.

Method: A novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher, with a two-stage training process.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy with 10x reduction in DFT calculations.

Conclusion: The proposed KD framework, using a non-fine-tuned pre-trained NNP as a teacher, achieves comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties while reducing DFT calculations by 10x.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (cI2SB) framework for acoustic FWI, which overcomes limitations of existing diffusion models and achieves better performance in reconstructing velocity models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for acoustic Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) have limitations in terms of iterative sampling, output control, and incorporating approximate velocity models.

Method: The paper employs a Schrödinger Bridge to interpolate between the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models, extending the concept of Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (I2SB) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (cI2SB) framework.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in reconstructing the reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation and observed seismic signal, outperforming a reimplemented conditional diffusion model and achieving superior sample fidelity compared to supervised learning.

Conclusion: The proposed cI2SB method outperforms existing conditional diffusion models and supervised learning approaches in reconstructing velocity models, achieving superior sample fidelity with fewer neural function evaluations.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

Motivation: 在更实际的黑盒设置中，梯度在训练期间无法操纵，并且只能观察到最后的模型迭代，因此经验下界和理论上界之间仍然存在很大的差距。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上训练的图像分类模型上进行评估，证明了该方法实现了更严格的界限

Conclusion: 利用分位数回归进行MIA的方法，实现了更严格的界限，同时关键地保持了单次运行方法的计算效率。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph

designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying

introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and

between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results

Conclusion: 我们证明了该方法在跨多种疾病的患者级别 scRNA-seq 数据上的有效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Conclusion: PRISM produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

Motivation: 现代人工智能系统经常依赖不透明的黑盒模型，最显着的是深度神经网络，其性能源于具有数百万个学习参数的复杂架构。虽然功能强大，但它们的复杂性对可信度构成了重大挑战，特别是由于缺乏透明度。可解释人工智能（XAI）通过提供人类可理解的模型行为解释来解决这个问题。然而，为了确保它们的有用性和可信度，必须对这些解释进行严格的评估。尽管XAI方法的数量不断增加，但该领域缺乏标准化的评估协议和对适当指标的共识。

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在实际应用中已变得不可或缺。然而，它们的广泛采用引起了重大的安全问题，尤其是在回应具有社会危害的问题时。尽管通过对齐来提高模型安全性做出了大量努力，但对齐模型的安全保护仍然可能因后续的微调而受到破坏，即使额外的训练数据看起来是良性的。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

### [199] [Learn to Vaccinate: Combining Structure Learning and Effective Vaccination for Epidemic and Outbreak Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15397)
*Sepehr Elahi,Paula Mürmann,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and only the infection states of the vertices are observed. We split the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. Previous works assumed that the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice.

Method: We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm and detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem. This is complemented by an efficient and effective polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph.

Result: We establish the sample complexity for graph recovery and prove that the running time of our optimal algorithm is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with bounded treewidth.

Conclusion: We present experiments on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and vaccination algorithms.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

### [200] [AutoRule: Reasoning Chain-of-thought Extracted Rule-based Rewards Improve Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15651)
*Tevin Wang,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule automates the extraction of rules from preference feedback for rule-based rewards in RLHF, improving performance and reducing reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rule-based rewards for improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often rely on manual rule engineering.

Method: AutoRule: a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. It leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Language-model verifiers compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output as an auxiliary reward.

Result: AutoRule improves length-controlled win rate by 28.6% on AlpacaEval2.0 and second-turn performance by 6.1% on a held-out MT-Bench subset. It also demonstrates reduced reward hacking.

Conclusion: AutoRule improves length-controlled win rate and second-turn performance compared to a GRPO baseline. Extracted rules align with dataset preferences, reduce reward hacking, and capture unique qualities valued in different datasets.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

### [201] [Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning Under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15446)
*Scott Jeen,Tom Bewley,Jonathan M. Cullen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: zero-shot RL methods can generalise to any unseen task in an environment after reward-free pre-training, but the performance degrades when subjected to partially observability. Memory-based architectures are an effective remedy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: the performance of standard zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability

Method: memory-based zero-shot RL methods

Result: improved performance over memory-free baselines in domains where the states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed

Conclusion: memory-based architectures are an effective remedy for the performance degradation of standard zero-shot RL methods when subjected to partially observability, and show improved performance over memory-free baselines

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

### [202] [Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15679)
*Xiaoqing Sun,Alessandro Stolfo,Joshua Engels,Ben Wu,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Mrinmaya Sachan,Max Tegmark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dense latents in SAEs are not noise but serve functional roles in language model computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. However, many SAE latents activate frequently, raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure.

Method: systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents

Result: demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs; introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction; analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model.

Conclusion: Dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

*Simiao Lin,Wannes Meert,Pieter Robberechts,Hendrik Blockeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的时间序列比较技术，通过简化弯曲路径来突出关键转换，从而增强可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的可视化侧重于点对点对齐，无法传达子序列层面更广泛的结构关系。这种限制使得理解一个时间序列如何以及在何处相对于另一个时间序列移动、加速或减速变得困难。

Method: 提出了一种新技术，简化了弯曲路径，以突出、量化和可视化关键转换（移位、压缩、幅度差异）。

Result: 该方法能够突出、量化和可视化关键转换（移位、压缩、幅度差异）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过更清晰地表示时间序列之间子序列的匹配方式，增强了时间序列比较的可解释性。

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

### [204] [Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Robust Homophily Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15448)
*Guoguo Ai,Hezhe Qiao,Hui Yan,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RHO: Robust Homophily Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in real-world GAD datasets.

Method: RHO consists of two novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned by the filters in the two views.

Result: Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

Conclusion: RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new user-guided dimensionality reduction technique using multimodal large language models, allowing users to steer projections with natural language and improve cluster separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dimensionality reduction techniques are not designed to explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of variables or class labels.

Method: The paper uses a novel user-guided projection framework for image and text data, leveraging zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Result: The method enhances cluster separation and transforms dimensionality reduction into an interactive, user-driven process.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a user-guided projection framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable, data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The method enhances cluster separation and transforms dimensionality reduction into an interactive, user-driven process, bridging the gap between fully automated techniques and human-centered data exploration.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

Result: LIT-LVM实现了优于弹性网络和分解机的预测精度，特别是在交互项的数量相对于样本数量较高时。LIT-LVM还为特征提供了低维潜在表示，这些表示对于可视化和分析它们的关系非常有用。

Conclusion: LIT-LVM在各种模拟和真实数据上实现了优于弹性网络和分解机的预测精度，特别是在交互项的数量相对于样本数量较高时。LIT-LVM还为特征提供了低维潜在表示，这些表示对于可视化和分析它们的关系非常有用。

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事后归因方法旨在通过突出有影响力的输入像素来解释深度学习预测。然而，这些解释非常不稳健：微小的、难以察觉的输入扰动会大大改变属性图，同时保持相同的预测。这种漏洞破坏了它们的可信度，并要求对像素级属性分数进行严格的鲁棒性保证。

Method: 该论文介绍了一种认证框架，该框架使用随机平滑来保证任何黑盒属性方法的像素级鲁棒性。

Result: 该论文提出了三个评估指标来评估认证的鲁棒性、定位和忠实度。

Conclusion: 该论文通过稀疏化和平滑属性图，将任务重新表述为分割问题，并针对$\\ell_2$-有界扰动认证每个像素的重要性。对 5 个 ImageNet 模型上 12 种属性方法的大量评估表明，该论文认证的属性是稳健、可解释和可信的，从而可以在下游任务中可靠地使用。

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the over-squashing problem in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which is amplified by the temporal dimension. The paper formalizes the problem, analyzes the behavior of convolutional STGNNs, and proves that different processing paradigms are equally affected. The findings are validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental limitations in GNNs' information propagation capabilities, such as over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information. While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by increasing the information that must be propagated.

Method: The paper formalizes the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrates its distinct characteristics compared to the static case. The analysis reveals that counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, the paper proves that architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical justification for computationally efficient implementations.

Result: Convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from points temporally distant rather than close in time. Architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon.

Conclusion: The paper validates findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

TL;DR: RePCS 是一种诊断方法，用于检测 RAG 系统中的记忆行为，而无需模型访问或重新训练，通过比较参数路径和检索增强路径之间的 KL 散度来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 响应可能会依赖于记忆的训练数据，绕过检索到的证据，并产生受污染的输出。检索增强生成 (RAG) 已成为使用当前外部信息更新大型语言模型 (LLM) 响应的常见策略。

Method: 引入了检索路径污染评分 (RePCS)，这是一种诊断方法，无需模型访问或重新训练即可检测此类行为。RePCS 比较了两个推理路径：(i) 仅使用查询的参数路径，以及 (ii) 通过计算其输出分布之间的 Kullback-Leibler (KL) 散度，使用查询和检索到的上下文的检索增强路径。 

Result: 在 Prompt-WNQA 基准测试中，RePCS 实现了 0.918 的 ROC-AUC。该结果优于之前最强的方法 6.5 个百分点，同时在 NVIDIA T4 GPU 上的延迟开销保持在 4.7% 以下。

Conclusion: RePCS 提供了一个轻量级的黑盒安全措施，用于验证 RAG 系统是否有意义地利用检索，使其在安全关键型应用中尤其有价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores learning computable functions with computational and input constraints, showing both possibilities and limitations in learning general recursive functions and connections to transducer inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of learning computable functions in the limit under more realistic constraints than traditional input-output observations allow.

Method: The paper extends Gold's inductive inference framework by incorporating computational observations (Time-Bound and Policy-Trajectory Observations) and restricted input sources.

Result: The paper shows that computational complexity constraints or time-bound observations can enable learning of general recursive functions. It also demonstrates that learning from policy trajectories relates to finite-state transducer inference. However, it proves the non-existence of computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets for linear-time computable functions with policy-trajectory observations.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that while input-output observations are insufficient for learning general recursive functions, imposing computational complexity constraints or using approximate time-bound observations can overcome this limitation. Additionally, the paper connects learning from policy trajectories to finite-state transducer inference. However, it also shows that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets do not exist for linear-time computable functions, even with policy-trajectory observations.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simplified analysis of SGD in linear regression using linear algebra, achieving the same results as previous work with a more complex approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization algorithms. Previous work provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear regression using constant learning rate, but the analysis is complex.

Method: The analysis uses simple linear algebra tools, avoiding the manipulation of operators on PSD matrices.

Result: The paper recovers the same bias and variance bounds as previous work with a simplified analysis.

Conclusion: This paper simplifies the analysis of SGD on linear regression, making it more accessible for further research on mini-batching and learning rate scheduling.

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the

TL;DR: DAILOC是一种新的域增量学习框架，它通过分离域转移与位置相关特征和记忆引导类潜在对齐来解决室内定位中的设备异构性和时间变化问题，实验表明，DAILOC显著优于现有技术方法。


<details>

Motivation: 基于Wi-Fi指纹的室内定位在实际部署中面临着由于设备异构性和室内环境中的时间变化而产生的域转移的重大挑战。现有的方法通常独立地解决这些问题，导致泛化能力差，并且随着时间的推移容易发生灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出了一种新的域增量学习框架DAILOC，该框架使用多级变分自动编码器分离域转移与位置相关特征，并引入了一种新的记忆引导类潜在对齐机制。

Result: DAILOC在多个智能手机、建筑物和时间实例上的实验表明，DAILOC显著优于现有技术方法，平均误差降低了2.74倍，最坏情况误差降低了4.6倍。

Conclusion: DAILOC显著优于现有技术方法，平均误差降低2.74倍，最坏情况误差降低4.6倍。

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

TL;DR: LogNet是一个新的框架，旨在解释和增强基于DL的室内定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习框架作为黑盒模型运行，对预测的进行方式或模型如何随着时间的推移对真实世界的噪声做出反应，提供的见解有限。缺乏可解释性阻碍了我们理解由环境动态引起的时间变化的影响，并调整模型以实现长期可靠性。

Method: 我们介绍LogNet，这是一种新颖的基于逻辑门框架，旨在解释和增强基于DL的室内定位。

Result: LogNet通过识别每个参考点(RP)影响最大的接入点(AP)，实现透明的推理，并揭示环境噪声如何扰乱dl驱动的定位决策。这种可解释性使我们能够跟踪和诊断模型失败，并调整DL系统，以实现更稳定的长期部署。在多个真实世界的建筑平面图和两年的时间变化中进行的评估表明

Conclusion: LogNet不仅解释了DL模型的内部行为，而且提高了性能，与之前的基于DL的模型相比，定位误差降低了1.1倍至2.8倍，模型尺寸缩小了3.4倍至43.3倍，延迟降低了1.5倍至3.6倍。

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

Abstract: Compositionality is one of the fundamental abilities of the human reasoning
process, that allows to decompose a complex problem into simpler elements. Such
property is crucial also for neural networks, especially when aiming for a more

ensembling zero-shot a set of expert models, assessing our methodology using a
challenging benchmark, designed to test compositionality capabilities. We show
that our Expert Composition method is able to achieve a much higher accuracy
than baseline algorithms while requiring less computational resources, hence

TL;DR: MicroRicci is a fast, self-tuning mesh smoothing algorithm suitable for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale is challenging due to the limitations of classical Ricci-flow solvers and greedy heuristics.

Method: A self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver using a greedy syndrome-decoding step augmented by two tiny neural modules.

Result: MicroRicci achieves 2.4x speedup in iteration counts, tightens curvature spread, achieves a UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93, and yields an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration.

Conclusion: MicroRicci achieves state-of-the-art mesh smoothing performance with linear-time updates and automatic hyperparameter adaptation, making it suitable for real-time, resource-limited applications.

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE: A memory-efficient DP training method using gradient random projection, achieving similar performance to DP-SGD with less memory overhead. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DP methods like DP-Adam have high memory overhead due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability.

Method: DP-GRAPE, which privatizes gradients after projection, uses random Gaussian matrices, and applies projection during backpropagation.

Result: DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large compared to DP-Adam, achieving similar performance.

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage significantly while maintaining utility comparable to DP-SGD. It scales to large models like OPT with up to 6.7 billion parameters.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GFLC, a graph-based method to correct label noise and preserve demographic parity in datasets, improving the balance between performance and fairness in ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in ML is critical, but training data often contains biased and noisy labels, affecting model performance and fairness during testing.

Method: The paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label Correction (GFLC), combining prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity incentives.

Result: GFLC improves the trade-off between performance and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The experimental results demonstrate GFLC's effectiveness, showing significant improvements in the trade-off between performance and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes.

Method: We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning.

Result: While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.

Conclusion: FL enables accurate age predictions without data centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors, and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的离线强化学习算法，用于解决由于次优离线数据中的不良探索而导致的过度保守问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习算法通常需要额外的约束或惩罚项来解决分布偏移问题，例如在策略优化过程中增加隐式或显式策略约束，以减少函数的估计偏差。本文重点关注优势加权回归系列 (AWR) 的一个局限性，即由于数据损坏（特别是次优离线数据中的不良探索）导致学习过度保守策略的潜力。

Method: 提出 Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR)，它在策略优化过程中加入了一组鲁棒的损失函数，并采用了一种基于优势的优先经验回放方法来过滤掉不良探索。

Result: 证明了这种过度保守主义主要是由策略优化损失函数对不良探索的敏感性以及离线数据集中不良探索的比例引起的。

Conclusion: Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR) 能在 D4RL 基准测试中学习到更好的策略， 显著提高策略优化的性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.
