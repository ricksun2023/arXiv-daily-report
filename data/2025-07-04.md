### [1] [McBE: A Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02088)
*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多任务中文偏差评估基准 (McBE)，用于评估大型语言模型中的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 越来越多地应用于各种 NLP 任务，其固有的偏见也逐渐显露出来。因此，衡量 LLM 中的偏见对于减轻其伦理风险至关重要。然而，大多数现有的偏见评估数据集都侧重于英语和北美文化，并且它们的偏见类别并不完全适用于其他文化。以中国语言和文化为基础的数据集很少。更重要的是，这些数据集通常只支持单一的评估任务，无法从多个方面评估 LLM 中的偏差。

Method: 我们提出了一个多任务中文偏差评估基准（McBE），其中包括 4,077 个偏差评估实例，涵盖 12 个单一偏差类别，82 个子类别，并引入 5 个评估任务，提供广泛的类别覆盖、内容多样性，并衡量全面性。

Result: 我们评估了来自不同系列的几个流行的大型语言模型，并具有不同的参数大小。

Conclusion: 所有这些大型语言模型都表现出不同程度的偏差。我们对结果进行了深入分析，为大型语言模型中的偏差提供了新的见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Reasoning or Not? A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02145)
*Keyan Jin,Yapeng Wang,Leonel Santos,Tao Fang,Xu Yang,Sio Kei Im,Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了推理LLM在对话摘要中的表现，发现显式推理并不总是有效，有时甚至会降低摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话摘要是一项具有重要实际价值的挑战性任务，尤其是在客户服务、会议分析和会话AI中。尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在摘要任务中取得了显著进展，但对于需要并发抽象和简洁性的对话场景，逐步推理架构（特别是长链思维（CoT）实现）的性能仍有待探索。

Method: 对最先进的推理LLM和非推理LLM在三种主要范式（通用、面向角色和面向查询的对话摘要）上进行了全面和系统的评估。

Result: 研究表明，显式逐步推理并不总能提高对话摘要的质量。相反，与非推理模型相比，推理LLM通常更冗长，事实不一致，并且摘要不够简洁。

Conclusion: 显式逐步推理并不总能提高对话摘要的质量。与非推理模型相比，推理模型通常更冗长，事实不一致，并且摘要不够简洁。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

### [3] [Latent Chain-of-Thought? Decoding the Depth-Recurrent Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02199)
*Wenquan Lu,Yuechuan Yang,Kyle Lee,Yanshu Li,Enqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: investigate latent CoT in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer, and find limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: explore recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent space, potentially supporting latent CoT

Method: a suite of probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens

Result: limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of final and intermediate result tokens; significant probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks

Conclusion: depth recurrence yields only marginal gains; falls well short of models that externalize reasoning steps

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

### [4] [GDC Cohort Copilot: An AI Copilot for Curating Cohorts from the Genomic Data Commons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02221)
*Steven Song,Anirudh Subramanyam,Zhenyu Zhang,Aarti Venkat,Robert L. Grossman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GDC Cohort Copilot是一个开源工具，它使用自然语言处理来简化GDC队列的创建，并且优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDC用户在通过图形化队列构建器创建队列时，可能难以在数百个字段中找到特定的队列描述符，而使用自然语言描述队列可能更容易。

Method: 开发并评估了多个大型语言模型（LLM），包括本地部署的开源GDC Cohort LLM。

Result: GDC Cohort Copilot可以自动生成与用户输入的自然语言描述相对应的GDC队列过滤器，并导出队列以供进一步分析。提供交互式用户界面以进一步优化生成的队列。

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot使用户能够通过自然语言描述生成GDC队列，优于GPT-4o。

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.
  Availability and implementation: The standalone docker image for GDC Cohort
Copilot is available at https://quay.io/repository/cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.

### [5] [MemAgent: Reshaping Long-Context LLM with Multi-Conv RL-based Memory Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02259)
*Hongli Yu,Tinghong Chen,Jiangtao Feng,Jiangjie Chen,Weinan Dai,Qiying Yu,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma,Jingjing Liu,Mingxuan Wang,Hao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemAgent通过分段读取和覆盖策略更新内存，并结合DAPO算法进行训练，实现了卓越的长文本处理能力，并在长文本QA和RULER测试中取得了优异的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管长度外推、高效注意力机制和记忆模块有所改进，但在外推过程中，以线性复杂度处理无限长的文档而不降低性能仍然是长文本处理的最终挑战。

Method: 提出了一种新的代理工作流程MemAgent，它以分段方式读取文本，并使用覆盖策略更新内存。扩展了DAPO算法，以促进通过独立上下文多轮对话生成进行训练。

Result: MemAgent在长文本处理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: MemAgent表现出卓越的长文本处理能力，在3.5M QA任务中，从32K文本训练的8K上下文外推性能损失小于5%，并在512K RULER测试中达到95%以上的准确率。

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

### [6] [DoMIX: An Efficient Framework for Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02302)
*Dohoon Kim,Donghun Kang,Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes DoMIX, a LoRA-based approach for efficient and order-robust continual domain-adaptive pre-training, providing tailored pre-trained models for specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing continual DAP methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3) providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the essence of DAP.

Method: DoMIX, leveraging LoRA modules

Result: enables efficient and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios.

Conclusion: DoMIX: a novel approach that addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules. Our approach enables efficient and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

### [8] [QFFN-BERT: An Empirical Study of Depth, Performance, and Data Efficiency in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02364)
*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFFN-BERT 是一种混合量子经典 Transformer，它用基于 PQC 的层替换 FFN 模块。与经典对应模型相比，它实现了更高的精度，同时显著减少了参数，并在少样本学习中表现出优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFN 的参数贡献占主导地位，约占标准 Transformer 编码器块中参数的三分之二。先前的工作主要将 PQC 集成到自注意力模块中，而这项工作侧重于 FFN，并系统地研究了 PQC 深度、可表达性和可训练性之间的权衡。

Method: 用基于 PQC 的层替换紧凑型 BERT 变体的 feedforward network (FFN) 模块，介绍了一种混合量子经典 Transformer，即 QFFN-BERT。

Result: 精心配置的 QFFN-BERT 在全数据设置中实现了高达基线精度 102.0% 的水平，超过了其经典对应模型，同时将 FFN 特定参数减少了 99% 以上。该模型在少样本学习场景中表现出一致且具有竞争力的优势，证实了其在卓越数据效率方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 参数化的量子电路可以作为经典 FFN 的强大且参数高效的替代方案，前提是它们与基础深度学习原则共同设计。

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种参数模型代码数据选择方法，以提高训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法主要通过利用大量数据来提高模型性能，侧重于数据数量，而经常忽略数据质量，从而降低了训练效率。

Method: 利用参数模型进行代码数据选择，旨在提高训练效率和模型性能。优化参数模型以确保所选子集中的分布一致性和多样性，从而保证高质量的数据。

Result: 使用仅 10K 样本，该方法实现了 2.4% (HumanEval) 和 2.3% (MBPP) 的收益，超过了 92K 全采样基线，在性能和效率上优于其他采样方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过仅使用 10K 样本，在 HumanEval 上实现了 2.4% 的提升，在 MBPP 上实现了 2.3% 的提升，优于 92K 全样本基线，在性能和效率上均优于其他采样方法。这表明该方法有效地提高了模型性能，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

TL;DR: 本研究对七个阿坎语ASR模型在四个阿坎语语音语料库上进行了基准测试，结果表明领域依赖性以及Whisper和Wav2Vec2架构之间不同的错误行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数自动语音识别（ASR）研究都使用领域内数据集评估模型。然而，它们很少评估模型在不同的语音环境中如何泛化。

Method: 使用四个阿坎语语音语料库，对基于transformer架构（如Whisper和Wav2Vec2）构建的七个阿坎语ASR模型进行基准测试，以确定它们的性能。

Result: 单词错误率和字符错误率的比较突出了领域依赖性。微调的Whisper Akan模型导致更流畅但可能具有误导性的转录错误，而Wav2Vec2在遇到不熟悉的输入时会产生更明显但更难以理解的输出。

Conclusion: ASR模型在各自的训练领域内表现最佳，但在不匹配的情况下精度会显著下降。在为低资源语言（LRL）应用选择架构时，应考虑ASR错误的可读性和透明性之间的权衡。

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

widely spoken indigenous language in Ghana. The study involved participants
from diverse backgrounds with speech impairments. The resulting dataset, along
with the cookbook and open-source tools, are publicly available to enable
researchers and practitioners to create inclusive ASR technologies tailored to
the unique needs of speech impaired individuals. In addition, this study

Result: WebSailor significantly outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

Conclusion: WebSailor significantly outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

*Cornelia Gruber,Helen Alber,Bernd Bischl,Göran Kauermann,Barbara Plank,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个 HLV 感知主动学习的概念框架，以解决现有主动学习方法忽略人类标签变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取高质量的标记数据仍然是应用监督学习中的一个限制因素。虽然标签变化 (LV) 很常见，尤其是在自然语言处理中，但注释框架通常仍然基于单一基本事实的假设。这忽略了人类标签变化 (HLV)，即注释中可能存在的合理差异，而 HLV 是一种信息信号。

Method: 本文考察了关于真值和标签性质的基本假设，强调需要将观察到的 LV 分解为信号（例如，HLV）和噪声（例如，注释错误）。

Result: 本文提出了一种在整个 AL 循环中结合 HLV 的概念框架，包括实例选择、注释者选择和标签表示。我们进一步讨论了将大型语言模型 (LLM) 作为注释器的集成。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为 HLV 感知主动学习奠定概念基础，更好地反映真实世界注释的复杂性。

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

TL;DR: MPF is a post-training alignment framework for LLMs that uses multiperspective generations to mitigate bias. It aligns LLM sentiment distributions with human-like baselines, offering a scalable and interpretable method without extensive prompt engineering or finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: growing need for easy bias mitigation

Method: MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the decomposition.

Result: align LLM sentiment distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence, reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions.

Conclusion: MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive prompt engineering or finetuning.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM在识别论文局限性方面的潜力，提出了LimitGen基准，并通过实验证明结合文献检索可以提高LLM识别局限性的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日益增长的出版物给同行评审带来了挑战，尤其是在识别论文局限性方面，LLM在这方面的潜力尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出了LimitGen，一个综合性的基准，用于评估LLM识别论文局限性的能力。该基准包含合成数据集LimitGen-Syn和人工撰写的局限性集合LimitGen-Human。通过文献检索增强LLM的能力。

Result: 通过文献检索增强的LLM系统能够更好地识别研究论文中的局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs可以辅助识别论文的局限性，通过结合文献检索，LLM系统能够生成更具体和建设性的反馈。

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

*Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究调查了元音模仿中“Just Producible Difference”（JPD），发现JPD的估计值在F1 X F2空间中为14到51 mels。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究表明，人类元音产生的复杂和协调的发音运动受控制机制的支配，这些控制机制的目标是听觉空间区域。在亚音素级别的目标区域内也已证明了控制。但是，该控制的准确程度是未知的。目前的工作通过询问两个元音刺激在听觉空间中必须相距多远才能产生可靠的不同模仿来研究这个问题？

Method: 使用元音模仿范式来获得英语使用者在前元音产生过程中JPD的首次测量。

Result: JPD的估计值在F1 X F2空间中为14到51 mels。

Conclusion: JPD的估计值在F1 X F2空间中为14到51 mels。该发现对语音产生的偶发理论有影响。它通过为两个元音音素在说话者的共振峰空间中可能有多接近设置理论下限，从而阐明了人类元音系统的可能结构，并因此对观察到的元音音素数量和模式的趋势进行了心理物理学解释。

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

### [19] [Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02778)
*Ken Tsui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在纠正自身错误方面存在盲点，这可能是由于训练数据中缺乏错误纠正示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）虽然具有变革性，但仍会犯错，并可能探索无成效的推理路径。自我纠正是可信赖LLM的重要能力，特别是自回归LLM。LLM可以识别用户输入中的错误，但它们表现出系统性的“自我修正盲点”，无法纠正自身输出中相同的错误。

Method: 通过构建Self-Correction Bench框架，对LLM进行受控错误注入，并在三个复杂度级别上进行测量。

Result: 发现平均盲点率为64.5%。人类训练数据主要展示无错误响应，而不是错误纠正序列，这与通过结果反馈学习错误纠正的RL训练模型不同。简单地附加“Wait”可减少89.3%的盲点。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型（LLM）存在“自我修正盲点”，即无法纠正自身输出中与用户输入相同的错误。通过引入Self-Correction Bench框架，对14个模型进行测试，发现平均盲点率为64.5%。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

*Riccardo Cantini,Nicola Gabriele,Alessio Orsino,Domenico Talia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMs are more vulnerable to bias than base models, challenging the assumption that reasoning improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation.

Method: Evaluate state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak techniques.

Result: Reasoning capabilities do not inherently improve robustness and may open new pathways for stereotype reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those relying on CoT prompting.

Conclusion: Reasoning-enabled models are more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models, and CoT prompting is particularly prone to contextual reframing attacks.

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

TL;DR: 提出了MathV-DP数据集和Qwen-VL-DP模型，以提高多模态数学推理的准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于数学推理的多模态LLM（MLLM）通常依赖于一对一的图像-文本对和单一解决方案监督，忽略了有效推理视角和内部反思的多样性。

Method: 提出Qwen-VL-DP，一个建立在Qwen-VL之上的模型，通过监督学习进行微调，并通过群体相对策略优化（GRPO）进行增强，GRPO是一种基于规则的RL方法，集成了正确性判别和多样性感知奖励函数。

Result: 在MathVista的minitest和Math-V基准上的大量实验表明，Qwen-VL-DP在准确性和生成多样性方面显著优于先前的基础MLLM。

Conclusion: Qwen-VL-DP在准确性和生成多样性方面显著优于先前的基础MLLM，突出了在多模态数学推理中结合不同视角和反思性推理的重要性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SynapseRoute, which dynamically routes queries to thinking or non-thinking modes, improving accuracy and reducing cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting appropriate LLMs requires balancing performance and operational cost. Reasoning-capable models have widened the cost gap between thinking and non-thinking modes.

Method: The paper proposes a machine learning-based dynamic routing framework called SynapseRoute.

Result: SynapseRoute improves accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272), reduces inference time by 36.8%, and token consumption by 39.66%. Over-reasoning can decrease accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper introduces SynapseRoute, a dynamic routing framework, and the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index for evaluating trade-offs in LLMs.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个新的基准 IFBench，以评估精确指令遵循泛化，并表明使用可验证奖励的强化学习 (RLVR) 显着提高了指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型或聊天机器人精确地遵循人类指令的能力是成功的人与人工智能交互的关键因素。指令的一个常见特征是输出约束，例如“仅回答是或否”或“至少 3 次提及“abrakadabra”一词”，用户添加这些约束以制作更有用的答案。即使是今天最强大的模型也难以满足这些约束。

Method: 我们引入了一个新的基准 IFBench，以评估 58 个新的、多样化的和具有挑战性的可验证的域外约束的精确指令遵循泛化。此外，我们还对如何以及在什么数据上训练模型以提高精确指令遵循泛化进行了广泛的分析。我们发布了 29 个额外的新手工注释的训练约束和验证功能、RLVR 训练提示和代码。

Result: 大多数模型强烈过度拟合来自测试这些能力（称为精确指令遵循）的基准测试中的一小部分可验证约束，并且无法很好地推广到未见过的输出约束。

Conclusion: 我们发现，大多数模型过度拟合一小部分可验证的约束，并且无法很好地推广到未见过的输出约束。我们仔细设计了约束验证模块，并表明使用可验证奖励的强化学习 (RLVR) 显着提高了指令遵循能力。

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

TL;DR: 单个用户可以通过操纵反馈来改变语言模型的知识和行为，从而导致插入虚假信息、引入安全漏洞和注入虚假新闻。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在发现语言模型偏好调整的一个新的定性特征，并为使用用户反馈训练的语言模型提供一种新的攻击机制。

Method: 攻击者提示语言模型随机输出“中毒”或良性响应，然后赞成中毒响应或反对良性响应。

Result: 该攻击可用于 (1) 插入模型以前不具备的事实知识，(2) 以引入可利用的安全缺陷的方式修改代码生成模式，以及 (3) 注入虚假金融新闻。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了使用用户反馈训练的语言模型中存在的漏洞，即单个用户可以通过提供提示和对语言模型输出进行投票来持久地改变语言模型的知识和行为。

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

### [25] [MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Fine-tuning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02851)
*Purbesh Mitra,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOTIF是一种RL训练方法，通过多轮生成thinking tokens来扩展LLM的上下文大小，在数学基准测试中优于GRPO，且具有样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的推理能力有所提高，采用群体相对策略优化（GRPO）算法进行强化学习（RL）训练，使得模型可以使用更多的思考/推理tokens来生成更好的响应。然而，LLM只能生成有限数量的tokens，同时保持对先前生成的tokens的关注。这种限制，也称为LLM的上下文大小，是LLM推理中任意数量tokens的瓶颈。为了突破上下文大小的限制进行思考，LLM必须采用模块化思考策略，以进行多轮推理。

Method: 提出了MOTIF：通过强化微调进行模块化思考——一种RL训练方法，用于生成多轮思考tokens，有效允许模型以额外的上下文大小进行思考。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，通过参数高效微调训练了开源模型Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct，并在MATH500和AIME2024基准测试中测试了其准确性。

Conclusion: MOTIF在MATH500和AIME2024基准测试中，相较于vanilla GRPO训练，分别实现了3.8%和3.3%的改进，并且仅使用15%的样本实现了这一改进，证明了MOTIF的样本效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and
https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/MOTIF, respectively.

TL;DR: 多项选择题评估有缺陷。答案匹配是一种更可靠的替代方案，它通过将模型生成的答案与参考答案进行比较来评估模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多项选择题评估存在局限性，模型无需理解问题即可找到答案。生成式评估（特别是答案匹配）是多项选择题的可扩展替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种新的评估方法，称为答案匹配，通过让模型生成自由形式的答案，然后使用语言模型来判断答案是否与参考答案匹配。

Result: 答案匹配与人类评估结果高度吻合，而多项选择题评估和不带参考答案的 LLM-as-a-judge 方法与人类评估结果吻合度较差。

Conclusion: 利用答案匹配进行评估可以显著改变模型的排名，并更准确地反映模型性能。

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

TL;DR: Monocular depth estimation models perform poorly underwater due to domain shifts; fine-tuning on synthetic underwater data improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliability of monocular depth estimation in underwater environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.

Method: Fine-tuning Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater variant of the Hypersim dataset.

Result: Fine-tuned model consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of domain adaptation and scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth predictions in challenging underwater environments.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

TL;DR: ESTR-CoT is a new framework for event stream scene text recognition that uses chain-of-thought reasoning to improve interpretability and performance in challenging scenarios. A large-scale CoT dataset is also introduced to train the framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for event stream based scene text recognition lack interpretability and contextual logical reasoning capabilities, especially in challenging scenarios like low illumination and fast motion.

Method: The paper proposes a framework that uses EVA-CLIP for vision encoding, a Llama tokenizer for prompt encoding, and a Q-former to align vision tokens to Vicuna-7B for CoT reasoning. Supervised fine-tuning is used for optimization.

Result: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness and interpretability of ESTR-CoT on EventSTR, WordArt*, and IC15* datasets.

Conclusion: The paper introduces ESTR-CoT, a novel chain-of-thought reasoning framework for event stream scene text recognition, and validates its effectiveness and interpretability through experiments on three benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本多模态复合表情识别方法，在多个数据集上表现良好，代码已开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的复合表情识别方法依赖于特定任务的训练数据，而该论文旨在提出一种无需特定训练数据的零样本方法。

Method: 该方法结合了六种异构模态，包括面部表情、场景和标签匹配、场景上下文、音频和文本，并引入了多头概率融合（MHPF）模块以及复合表情（CE）转换模块，后者使用成对概率聚合（PPA）和成对特征相似度聚合（PFSA）方法。

Result: 该方法在AffWild2、AFEW和C-EXPR-DB数据集上通过零样本测试分别取得了46.95%、49.02%和34.85%的F1分数，与在目标数据上训练的监督方法的结果相当。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的零样本多模态方法用于复合表情识别，并在多个数据集上取得了与监督方法相媲美的结果，无需领域适应。

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图形摘要 (GA) 在以可视化方式传达科学论文的关键发现方面起着至关重要的作用。然而，设计有效的 GA 需要先进的可视化技能，这对其广泛采用构成了障碍。

Method: 提出了置信度调整的 top-1 真值比率 (CAR)，这是一种新颖的推荐指标，可以对模型行为进行细粒度分析。

Result: SciGA-145k 是一个大型数据集，包含大约 145,000 篇科学论文和 114 万张图，专门用于支持 GA 的选择和推荐，并促进自动 GA 生成的研究。

Conclusion: SciGA-145k 通过统一任务和指标，为推进可视化科学交流奠定了基础，同时为科学人工智能的发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

Motivation: 从少数图像中学习稳健的物体检测器是工业视觉系统中的一项关键挑战，在这些系统中，收集高质量的训练数据可能需要数月时间。合成数据已成为数据高效视觉检测和拾取放置机器人的关键解决方案。

Method: 比较了两种条件策略：基于提示的和基于布局的。

Result: 当条件提示集很窄时，提示条件产生更高质量的合成数据；随着多样性的增长，布局条件变得更好。

Conclusion: 当布局提示与完整的训练分布匹配时，与单独使用真实数据相比，合成数据使平均精度提高了 34%，最高提高了 177%。

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的二值ViT——DIDB-ViT，它在保持原始ViT架构和计算效率的同时，具有高度的信息量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的二值ViT方法通常会遭受严重的性能下降或严重依赖全精度模块。为了解决这些问题

Method: 设计了一个包含差分信息的informative attention模块，以减少二值化造成的信息损失并增强高频保留。使用离散Haar小波进行频率分解，并整合不同频率的相似性。引入了一种改进的RPReLU激活函数来重构激活分布，扩大模型的表征能力。

Result: DIDB-ViT在图像分类和分割性能方面表现出色。

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT在多个ViT架构中显著优于最先进的网络量化方法，在图像分类和分割性能方面表现出色。

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少数帧图像的固有局限性和3D空间的冗余性降低了对遮挡和遥远场景的预测精度。现有的方法通过融合历史帧数据来提高性能，这需要额外的数据和大量的计算资源。

Method: 提出了FMOcc，一个具有流动匹配选择性状态空间模型的三视角(TPV)细化 occupancy 网络，用于少帧3D occupancy 预测。

Result: FMOcc在Occ3D-nuScenes和OpenOcc数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有的state-of-theart方法。

Conclusion: FMOcc在Occ3D-nuScenes和OpenOcc数据集上优于现有技术水平的方法。在Occ3D-nuScenes验证集上，使用两帧输入实现了43.1%的RayIoU和39.8%的mIoU，在OpenOcc上实现了42.6%的RayIoU，推理内存为5.4 G，推理时间为330ms。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes.

Method: propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch) with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target scenes in noise condition.

Result: The proposed BiDA performs significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches. In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is more than 3%~5% higher than the most advanced method.

Result: Impressive improvements are achieved under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, with enhanced performance on the VGGSound dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed self-distillation method improves V2A performance, especially with partial visibility, and enhances results on VGGSound.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive

Conclusion: LaCo在压缩视觉编码器中间层的tokens时，优于所有现有方法，并保持了强大的性能。与外部压缩相比，该方法将训练效率提高了20%以上，推理吞吐量提高了15%以上。

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a text feature-guided visual prompt tuning framework with Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA) for Domain Generalization (DG), achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective design of prompts capable of disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical challenge in VFM-based domain prompt tuning within DG.

Method: The paper introduces a framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning, which disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM) and learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the disentangled text feature. It also introduces Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA) to extend text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of abstract prompts and stylized image augmentations.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods on major DG datasets, including PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods on major DG datasets, including PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Conclusion: ViRefSAM在三个少样本分割基准测试中表现出色，证明了其在利用少量参考图像进行精确和自动分割未见类别的能力，并且在不同的数据集上始终优于现有的少样本分割方法。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

TL;DR: Flow-CDNet, a two-branch network, detects both slow and fast changes in images, outperforming existing methods on a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images is important, especially for identifying precursors to major hazards in scenarios like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds.

Method: A change detection network (Flow-CDNet) with two branches: an optical flow branch for multi-scale displacement changes and a binary change detection branch combining ResNet with the optical flow output.

Result: Quantitative experiments on the Flow-Change dataset demonstrate that Flow-CDNet outperforms existing methods. Ablation experiments confirm that the two branches enhance each other's detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed Flow-CDNet outperforms existing methods on the self-built Flow-Change dataset, and ablation experiments show that the two branches enhance each other's detection performance.

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

Conclusion: LMPNet 可以自动发现对物体姿态具有鲁棒性的语义关键点，并且可以实现与监督姿态估计模型相当的强大预测精度。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

Conclusion: 将fMRI信号融入模型可以提高下游检测和分割的准确性，表明fMRI包含丰富的多对象语义线索和粗略的空间定位信息，而目前的模型尚未充分利用或整合这些元素。

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC 是一种用于少样本异常生成的新方法，它结合了掩码引导的修复、多级扰动和上下文感知对齐，以生成逼真且多样化的异常，同时保持正常的背景完整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业质量控制环境中，少样本异常生成正在成为一种可行的解决方案，用于扩充稀缺的异常数据。理想的生成器应同时满足三个需求，即 (i) 保持正常背景完整，(ii) 修复异常区域以与相应的异常掩码紧密重叠，以及 (iii) 在语义上有效的位置生成异常区域，同时仅从少数真实示例中生成逼真、多样化的外观。

Method: MAGIC--具有多级扰动和上下文感知对齐的Mask引导修复

Result: MAGIC通过微调Stable Diffusion修复主干来保留正常区域，并确保合成异常严格遵守提供的掩码，从而直接解决背景损坏和未对准问题。MAGIC添加了两种互补的扰动策略：(i) 应用于微调和推理期间的高斯提示级别扰动，可拓宽异常的全局外观，同时避免低保真文本外观，以及 (ii) 掩码引导的空间噪声注入，可丰富局部纹理变化。此外，上下文感知掩码对齐模块形成语义对应关系并重新定位掩码，以便每个异常都合理地包含在宿主对象中，从而消除边界外伪影。

Conclusion: MAGIC在下游异常检测任务中优于现有技术。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

Motivation: Achieving precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging in text-to-image diffusion models. Existing methods neglect intermediate generation stages, limiting its effectiveness.

Method: InnerControl, a training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps. It trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control signals from intermediate UNet features at every denoising step.

Result: Improves both control fidelity and generation quality by minimizing the discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire diffusion process.

Conclusion: InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning methods.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of rice leaf diseases is crucial for effective management and improved yields due to significant productivity reduction and economic losses.

Method: The study uses image-processing techniques based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and compares the Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) with the Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), utilizing Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs), Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms (FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with 10-fold Cross-Validation.

Result: The Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) achieves higher performance in classifying rice leaf diseases compared to the Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM).

Conclusion: The Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) outperforms the Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM) in classifying rice leaf diseases, suggesting its potential for improving crop health and rice farming sustainability.

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Conclusion: Hita在ImageNet基准测试中取得了显著成果，并在零样本风格迁移和图像修复方面表现出有效性。

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

TL;DR: LocalDyGS: A new framework for dynamic scene reconstruction that models both fine-scale and large-scale motions by decomposing the scene into local spaces and decoupling static and dynamic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthesizing dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world. Previous works are limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.

Method: The method decomposes a complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds and decouples static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to generate Temporal Gaussians.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and represents the first attempt to model larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework, LocalDyGS, that models highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. It achieves competitive performance on fine-scale datasets and is the first to model larger, more complex dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to

Method: Introducing UVLM, an underwater observation benchmark built through a collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models.

Result: The dataset covers a wide range of frame rates, resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and terrains, with 20 distinct task types. Challenging evaluation metrics enable quantitative comparison and analysis of different methods.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world understanding and shows potential for slight improvements on existing in-air VidLM benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a video data-based pseudo-labeling framework for monocular 3D object detection that overcomes data scarcity and 2D-to-3D ambiguity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) faces challenges due to data scarcity and 2D-to-3D ambiguity. Existing weakly supervised and pseudo-labeling methods are limited by domain-specific learning or reliance on shape information.

Method: The method aggregates pseudo-LiDARs of static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent frames using object point tracking.

Result: The proposed method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability for M3OD.

Conclusion: This paper presents a pseudo-labeling framework using video data for monocular 3D object detection (M3OD), achieving reliable accuracy and strong scalability.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

*Byung Hyun Lee,Wongi Jeong,Woojae Han,Kyoungbun Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMEL：一个用于持续多实例学习的框架，通过新颖的transformer和伪标签技术，在WSI定位方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIL通过包级别弱标签显著降低了大规模图像的标注成本，例如组织病理学全玻片图像(WSI)。然而，其在具有最小遗忘的持续任务中的适应性很少被探索，特别是在用于定位的实例分类上。用于语义分割的弱增量学习已经被研究用于持续定位，但它专注于自然图像，利用预训练模型在数百个小patch (例如，$16 
\times 16$)之间的全局关系。这种方法对于MIL定位似乎是不可行的，因为大量($
\sim 10^5$)的大patch (例如，$256 
\times 256$)，并且没有可用的全局关系，例如癌细胞。

Method: 提出了Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL)，一个用于定位和适应性的MIL框架，具有最小的遗忘。CoMEL包括：(1)用于有效实例编码的Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT)，(2)用于可靠实例伪标记的基于Bag Prototypes的Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL)，以及(3)用于减轻包和实例分类中的遗忘的正交加权低秩适应(OWLoRA)。

Result: 在三个公共WSI数据集上的大量实验表明，CoMEL具有优越的性能。

Conclusion: CoMEL在持续MIL设置下，在包级别准确率上超过现有技术高达11.00%，在定位准确率上超过高达23.4%。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的deepfake视频检测方法，该方法利用像素级的时间不一致性，通过对每个像素的时间轴执行一维傅里叶变换，提取对时间不一致性高度敏感的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的deepfake视频检测方法忽略了像素级的时间不一致性，并且仅仅通过堆叠跨帧的空间频率谱来表示时间信息，导致无法检测像素平面中的时间伪影。

Method: 对每个像素的时间轴执行一维傅里叶变换，提取对时间不一致性高度敏感的特征，尤其是在容易出现不自然运动的区域。引入以端到端方式训练的注意力提案模块，以精确定位包含时间伪影的区域。我们的联合transformer模块有效地将像素级时间频率特征与时空上下文特征相结合，扩大了可检测的伪造伪影的范围。

Result: 该方法在各种具有挑战性的检测场景中提供强大的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在deepfake视频检测方面代表着显著的进步，在各种具有挑战性的检测场景中提供强大的性能。

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

TL;DR: TAB Net是一种用于弱监督医学图像分割的新框架，它使用三重增强自恢复和边界感知伪标签监督来提高性能，并优于其他弱监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取大规模、完全注释的医学图像数据集既耗时又昂贵。涂鸦注释作为一种稀疏标记形式，为医学图像分割提供了一种高效且经济高效的替代方案。然而，涂鸦注释的稀疏性限制了目标区域的特征学习，并且缺乏足够的边界监督，这给训练分割网络带来了重大挑战。

Method: 提出了TAB Net，一个新颖的弱监督医学图像分割框架，由三重增强自恢复（TAS）模块和边界感知伪标签监督（BAP）模块组成。

Result: 在ACDC和MSCMR seg两个公共数据集上的实验评估表明，TAB Net明显优于最先进的基于涂鸦的弱监督分割方法。

Conclusion: TAB Net在基于涂鸦的弱监督分割方面显著优于现有方法，并且实现了与全监督方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Conclusion: We devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the

leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

Conclusion: 该框架在通用和广告编辑任务中始终优于现有基线，显着缩小了自动编辑视频和人工编辑视频之间的质量差距。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning

convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union

Motivation: 3D虚拟化身类似于现实生活中的面部美化，需要个性化的定制以增强其视觉吸引力，但这一领域尚未得到充分探索。虽然目前的3D高斯编辑方法可以适用于面部化妆，但这些方法未能满足实现逼真化妆效果的基本要求：1）确保在可驱动的表情中保持一致的外观，2）在整个化妆过程中保持身份，以及3）能够精确控制精细的细节。

Method: 我们提出了一种专门的3D化妆方法，名为AvatarMakeup，利用预训练的扩散模型从任何个体的单个参考照片中转移化妆模式。我们采用从粗到细的想法，首先保持一致的外观和身份，然后再细化细节。特别地，扩散模型被用来生成化妆图像作为监督。

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup实现了最先进的化妆转移质量和整个动画过程中的一致性。

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型在实际应用中展示了巨大的潜力，但视觉模态的安全漏洞对在开放世界环境中部署这些模型提出了重大挑战。现有的方法主要将视觉模态作为不安全行为的触发器，缺乏语义明确性和现实场景的基础。

Method: VisCo通过四种不同的视觉聚焦策略，动态生成辅助图像来构建以视觉为中心的越狱场景，并结合自动毒性混淆和语义细化来生成最终的攻击提示。

Result: VisCo实现了4.78的毒性评分和85%的攻击成功率，显著优于基线（毒性评分2.48，攻击成功率22.2%）。

Conclusion: VisCo在MM-SafetyBench上针对GPT-4o实现了4.78的毒性评分和85%的攻击成功率，显著优于基线。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

Result: Experiments on breast cancer and glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA.

Conclusion: The proposed I-DiPT framework outperforms existing TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA on breast cancer and glaucoma classification tasks.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while

*Hailong Yan,Junjian Huang,Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGDNet is a Zero-Shot method for enhancing underexposed images using decomposition and denoising modules, outperforming existing unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised methods for restoring underexposed images are impractical due to the difficulty of collecting paired datasets and can lead to over-enhancement.  The goal is to enhance images without training data or priors.

Method: A Zero-Shot enhancement method (IGDNet) with a decomposition module (dense connection network for separating illumination and reflection) and a denoising module (illumination-guided pixel adaptive correction). Noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined iteratively.

Result: IGDNet demonstrates strong generalization ability, effectively suppresses noise, and restores illumination, achieving superior visual quality and quantitative results compared to existing unsupervised methods on four public datasets.

Conclusion: IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under complex lighting conditions, outperforming 14 state-of-the-art unsupervised methods with a PSNR of 20.41dB and SSIM of 0.860dB.

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的弱监督对比学习（WeCoL）方案，只需要在模型训练期间进行简单的目标数量提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与一般目标检测不同，移动红外小目标检测由于目标尺寸小、背景对比度弱而面临巨大挑战。目前，大多数现有方法都是完全监督的，严重依赖于大量的人工目标注释。然而，手动注释视频序列通常既昂贵又耗时，特别是对于低质量的红外帧图像。

Method: 基于预训练的分割任何事物模型（SAM），设计了一种潜在目标挖掘策略，以整合目标激活图和多帧能量累积。此外，采用对比学习通过计算特征子空间中正负样本之间的相似性来进一步提高伪标签的可靠性。此外，我们提出了一种长短期运动感知学习方案，以同时对小目标的局部运动模式和全局运动轨迹进行建模。

Result: 在两个公共数据集（DAUB和ITSDT-15K）上的大量实验验证了

Conclusion: 该弱监督方案通常优于早期的全监督方法，甚至可以达到最先进（SOTA）全监督方法的90％以上。

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

Motivation: 现有的网格标记化方法总是产生具有重复顶点标记的标记序列，浪费了网络能力。

Method: 提出了一种紧凑而高效的网格表示 Mesh Silksong，它以类似于丝绸编织的自回归方式生成多边形网格，每个网格顶点只访问一次。

Result: Mesh Silksong 将 token 序列的冗余度降低了 50%，并实现了大约 22% 的最先进的压缩率。此外，Mesh Silksong 产生具有卓越几何属性的多边形网格，包括流形拓扑、水密检测和一致的面法线。

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong不仅能生成复杂的网格，还能显著提高几何完整性。

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new challenging dataset, CrowdTrack, is introduced for multi-pedestrian tracking in complex scenarios to address the limitations of existing datasets. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-object tracking datasets are too simple and not realistic enough for training robust pedestrian tracking models, especially in complex scenarios with occlusions and partial visibility.

Method: The dataset was created using first-person view recordings from real-life complex scenarios.

Result: The CrowdTrack dataset consists of 33 videos with 5,185 trajectories, each annotated with a bounding box and unique ID. The authors also tested SOTA models and foundation models on the dataset.

Conclusion: The authors created a new large-scale, challenging dataset called CrowdTrack for multi-pedestrian tracking in complex, real-life scenarios, and they provide a comprehensive analysis of the dataset and benchmarked SOTA models and foundation models.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

TL;DR: MedFormer是一种高效的医学视觉Transformer，它使用金字塔结构和双重稀疏选择注意力来提高各种医学图像识别任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于视觉Transformer的方法通常是特定于任务和架构的，限制了其通用性。此外，它们通常采用完整注意力或手工制作的稀疏注意力，导致计算成本高或性能欠佳。

Method: 提出了一种名为MedFormer的医学视觉Transformer，它采用了金字塔缩放结构和双重稀疏选择注意力（DSSA）。

Result: 在各种成像模式数据集上的大量实验表明，MedFormer在提高上述所有三种医学图像识别任务的性能方面非常有效。

Conclusion: MedFormer在多种医学图像识别任务中表现出色，提高了性能。

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种时间感知方法，用于在结肠镜检查中自动计数息肉，从而提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结肠镜检查中的自动息肉计数是实现自动程序报告和质量控制的关键一步，旨在提高结肠镜检查筛查的成本效益。现有的息肉计数方法依赖于自我监督学习，主要利用视觉外观，而忽略了 tracklet 特征学习和聚类阶段的时间关系。

Method: 提出了一个监督对比损失，该损失结合了时间感知软目标。通过整合时间邻接约束来改进 tracklet 聚类，从而减少视觉上相似但时间上遥远的 tracklet 之间的假阳性重关联。

Result: 与先前的方法相比，碎片率降低了 2.2 倍。

Conclusion: 强调了时间感知在息肉计数中的重要性，并建立了一个新的技术水平。

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

TL;DR: MC-INR是一种新的基于神经网络的框架，它可以处理非结构化网格上的多元数据，并通过结合元学习、聚类和残差动态重聚类机制来灵活地编码复杂结构，从而优于现有的科学数据编码方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于INR的方法存在三个主要局限性：(1)对复杂结构的表示不灵活，(2)主要关注单变量数据，(3)依赖于结构化网格。因此，当应用于复杂的真实世界数据集时，它们的性能会下降。

Method: 结合元学习和聚类，实现对复杂结构的灵活编码。引入基于残差的动态重聚类机制，自适应地基于局部误差对聚类进行分区。提出了一个分支层，通过独立的分支同时利用多元数据。

Result: MC-INR在科学数据编码任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MC-INR在科学数据编码任务上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling

fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian

outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops,
diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed
solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

Conclusion: IMASHRIMP demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological analysis, enhancing the efficiency of genetic selection and contributing to more sustainable aquaculture practices.

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination

authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,

TL;DR: MoGe-2 is proposed to recover a metric scale 3D point map from a single image by extending MoGe and using a unified data refinement approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to recover a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image, addressing the limitations of previous methods in achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained detail recovery simultaneously.

Method: The method extends MoGe for metric geometry prediction and develops a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real data using sharp synthetic labels.

Result: MoGe-2 achieves accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained detail recovery.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates MoGe-2's superior performance in achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained detail recovery, which no previous methods have simultaneously achieved.

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

TL;DR: A new method is proposed to improve human pose estimation in complex interactive scenarios by using human appearance cues and a dual-branch optimization framework. It outperforms existing methods and introduces a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human pose estimation methods struggle with visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions in recovering plausible close interactions from in-the-wild videos. Even large foundation models cannot accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. Human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to address these obstacles.

Method: A dual-branch optimization framework is proposed to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and physical laws. A diffusion model is trained to learn human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge.

Result: The method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos captured in complex environments. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos. A new dataset with pseudo ground-truth interaction annotations is built to promote future research.

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种在可微变换下连接体素、网格和参数模型的框架，用于精确捕捉复杂血管的几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 血管是体内复杂的结构，已经被广泛地研究过，有多种表现形式。虽然体素化是最常见的，但网格和参数化模型由于其理想的属性在各种应用中至关重要。然而，这些表示通常是通过分割提取的，并且彼此独立使用。

Method: 该论文提出了一个在可微变换下连接三种表示的框架。通过利用可微体素化，我们通过形状到分割的拟合自动提取血管的参数化形状模型，我们从分割中学习形状参数，而不需要明确的ground-truth形状参数。血管被参数化为使用三次B样条的中心线和半径，通过构造确保平滑性和连续性。网格是从学习到的形状参数中可微地提取的，从而产生可以进行后期处理的高保真网格。

Result: 我们的方法可以准确地捕捉复杂血管的几何结构，正如在主动脉、动脉瘤和脑血管的实验中的体积拟合所证明的那样。

Conclusion: 该方法可以准确地捕捉复杂血管的几何结构，主动脉、动脉瘤和脑血管的实验证明了这一点。

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

Motivation: Effectively supporting broader applications requires considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology, which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. Previous mSSL methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure variations.

Method: The authors propose an mSSL framework named S^2DC, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency in two steps: enforcing distinct representations for different patches using optimal transport and advancing semantic consistency at the structural level based on neighborhood similarity distribution.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in mSSL.

Conclusion: The proposed S^2DC method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in mSSL across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3 modalities.

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

TL;DR: AuroraLong replaces LLMs with linear RNNs for efficient long video understanding, achieving comparable performance with less resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence length.

Method: Replacing the LLM component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model and combining visual token merge with linear RNN models by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order.

Result: AuroraLong achieves comparable performance to Transformer-based models with only 2B parameters and trained on public data.

Conclusion: AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video understanding.

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Method: 提出了Holmes Pipeline，一个包含视觉专家预训练、监督微调和直接偏好优化三个阶段的训练框架。同时引入了一种协同解码策略。

Result: 构建了一个大规模综合数据集Holmes-Set，并提出了一个高效的数据标注方法Multi-Expert Jury。

Conclusion: AIGI-Holmes模型在三个基准测试中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

Conclusion: The proposed unfolded and distilled samplers achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency, while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at inference time.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为自适应个性化训练 (APT) 的新框架，该框架通过采用自适应训练策略和在微调期间对模型的内部表示进行正则化来缓解过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用有限的数据个性化扩散模型提出了重大挑战，包括过度拟合、先验知识的丢失和文本对齐的退化。过度拟合导致噪声预测分布的转变，扰乱了去噪轨迹，并导致模型失去语义连贯性。

Method: Adaptive Personalized Training (APT)，一个通过采用自适应训练策略和正则化模型在微调期间的内部表示来减轻过拟合的新框架。APT 包含三个关键组件：(1) 自适应训练调整，它引入一个过拟合指标来检测每个时间步 bin 的过拟合程度，并根据该指标应用自适应数据增强和自适应损失权重；(2) 表示稳定，它规范中间特征图的均值和方差，以防止噪声预测的过度偏移；(3) 用于先验知识保留的注意力对齐，它将微调模型的交叉注意力图与预训练模型的交叉注意力图对齐，以保持先验知识和语义连贯性。

Result: APT有效地缓解了过拟合，保留了先验知识，并且在生成具有有限参考数据的高质量、多样化图像方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: APT有效地缓解了过拟合，保留了先验知识，并且在生成具有有限参考数据的高质量、多样化图像方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要侧重于实现高质量的身份转移，但通常在保持目标面部的动态属性方面有所欠缺，从而导致不一致的结果。我们将此问题归因于视频中面部外观和运动的固有耦合。

Method: 提出CanonSwap，一种新颖的视频换脸框架，将运动信息与外观信息解耦。首先消除运动相关信息，从而在统一的规范空间内实现身份修改。随后，将交换后的特征重新整合到原始视频空间中，确保保留目标面部的动态属性。设计了一个部分身份调制模块，该模块使用空间掩码自适应地整合源身份特征，以限制对面部区域的修改。引入了几个细粒度的同步指标，以全面评估视频换脸方法的性能。

Result: 该方法在视觉质量、时间一致性和身份保持方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉质量、时间一致性和身份保持方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D reconstruction, understanding, and simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of the alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Motivation: existing mainstream keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals).

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

Conclusion: 在有限的数据设置中，我们的弱监督方法实现了 84.90% 的平均 Dice 分数，优于现有的全监督和弱监督方法。

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

Motivation: 生物医学数据、工具和文献的快速增长创造了一个分散的研究环境，其发展速度超过了人类的专业知识。虽然AI代理提供了一种解决方案，但它们通常依赖于静态的、手动管理的工具集，限制了它们的适应和扩展能力。

Method: STELLA采用了一种多代理架构，该架构通过两种核心机制自主提高自身能力：用于推理策略的不断发展的模板库和随着工具创建代理自动发现和集成新的生物信息学工具而扩展的动态工具海洋。

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除冗余特征并保留相关特征。

Method: 一种结合参数间相关性和参数-目标相关性的轻量级基于规则的特征选择方法，通过反向淘汰进行特征选择。

Result: HCVR在SPAMBASE数据集上的应用结果表明，与传统的非迭代和迭代技术相比，性能有所提高。

Conclusion: HCVR在SPAMBASE数据集上的应用结果表明，与传统的非迭代和迭代技术相比，性能有所提高。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

TL;DR: This survey reviews efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies to improve the computational efficiency of LLM reasoning, introducing a taxonomy and benchmarking models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models (LLMs) are inefficient at reasoning because they apply fixed inference-time compute regardless of task complexity, overthinking simple problems while underthinking hard ones. The survey focuses on improving the computational efficiency of LLM reasoning.

Method: The survey introduces a two-tiered taxonomy that distinguishes between L1-controllability (methods under fixed compute budgets) and L2-adaptiveness (methods that dynamically scale inference). It benchmarks leading proprietary LLMs across diverse datasets.

Result: The survey highlights critical trade-offs between reasoning performance and token usage. It emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and scalability of TTC methods, compared to prior surveys on efficient reasoning.

Conclusion: This survey concludes by discussing emerging trends like hybrid thinking models and key challenges for future work, aiming to make LLMs more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLM）的科学能力的最新尝试未能测试这些能力，因为wet-lab实验的成本非常高：在专业知识、时间和设备方面。

Method: 我们引入了SciGym，这是一个first-in-class的基准，用于评估LLM在开放式科学发现任务中的迭代实验设计和分析能力。SciGym通过运行生物系统的dry lab来克服wet-lab成本的挑战。这些模型以系统生物学标记语言编码，可以高效地生成模拟数据，使其成为在真实复杂系统上进行实验的理想测试平台。

Result: 我们评估了137个小型系统上的六个前沿LLM，并发布了总共350个系统。我们的评估表明，虽然更有能力的模型表现出更好的性能，但所有模型的性能都随着系统复杂性的增加而显著下降。

Conclusion: 所有模型的性能都随着系统复杂性的增加而显著下降，这表明LLM在科学能力方面还有很大的改进空间。

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

Motivation: 现代人工智能模型通常在大量数据上训练一次，可能针对特定任务进行微调，然后以固定参数进行部署。它们的训练成本高昂、缓慢且渐进，需要数十亿次的重复。与此形成鲜明对比的是，动物会不断适应环境中不断变化的偶然事件。这对于社会物种尤其重要，在与同伴互动时，行为策略和奖励结果可能会频繁变化。

Method: 整合了人工智能中关于持续和上下文学习的文献，以及神经科学中关于行为任务学习的文献，这些任务具有变化的规则、奖励概率或结果。

Result: 概述了神经科学如何具体地为该领域人工智能的当前发展提供信息，以及神经科学可以从人工智能中学到什么，从而为不断发展的神经人工智能领域做出贡献的议程。

Conclusion: 神经科学的见解可以为人工智能的持续和上下文学习提供信息，反之亦然，人工智能可以为神经科学提供信息，从而有助于神经人工智能领域的发展。

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

TL;DR: HiRA, a hierarchical framework, separates strategic planning from specialized execution, outperforming state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based systems on complex search tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional RAG pipelines struggle to address effectively. Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from using a single model for both high-level planning and detailed execution, leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability.

Method: HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from specialized execution, decomposing complex search tasks into focused subtasks and assigning each subtask to domain-specific agents with external tools and reasoning capabilities.

Result: Improvements in both answer quality and system efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution for multi-step information seeking tasks.

Conclusion: HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based systems on complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks, improving answer quality and system efficiency.

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 为了自动执行这些复杂决策，人工智能系统，尤其是那些使用机器学习的系统，正被部署在从招聘到贷款发放等领域。判断这些人工智能系统及其人类决策对应方的有效性和公平性，是一个复杂的且重要的课题，计算科学和社会科学都在对其进行研究。在机器学习中，解决下游分类器中偏差的常用方法是重新采样训练数据以抵消差异。虽然简单且看似有效，但这些方法通常只使用通过便利样本获得的数据进行评估，从而将选择偏差和标签偏差引入到指标中。

Method: 基于个体治疗效果估计方法的干预措施

Conclusion: 使用来自审计研究的数据可以提高我们训练和评估自动招聘算法的能力。我们发现，当使用传统方法进行评估时，常见的公平干预方法（即均衡各类的基本比率）似乎可以实现均等，但实际上，当使用适当的方法进行衡量时，仍然存在大约 10% 的差距。此外，我们还介绍了基于个体治疗效果估计方法的干预措施，这些措施可以利用这些数据进一步减少算法歧视。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

Motivation: 尽管最近在偏好学习方面的进展增强了人类反馈中的对齐，但数学推理仍然是一个持续的挑战。我们研究偏好优化中的数据多样化策略如何提高大型语言模型（LLM）的数学推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的结构化方法，即多样化思考解决（DTS），该方法系统地将问题分解为不同的推理路径。

Result: 结果表明，通过策略性地多样化偏好数据，模型可以显著提高数学推理性能，最佳方法在GSM8K上产生7.1%的增益，在MATH上产生4.2%的增益。尽管DTS具有强大的性能，但与基线相比，DTS仅产生边际计算开销（1.03倍），而MCTS的成本几乎高出五倍，但回报较低。

Conclusion: 通过策略性地多样化偏好数据，模型可以显著提高数学推理性能，最佳方法在GSM8K上产生7.1%的增益，在MATH上产生4.2%的增益。

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

TL;DR: LLMs' stated beliefs don't consistently align with their simulated behavior in role-playing scenarios, highlighting the need for careful consideration when using them in behavioral studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring that LLMs' outputs remain coherent with their assigned roles has become a critical concern, as LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic data for human behavioral research.

Method: An evaluation framework to measure how well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust Game, a belief-behavior consistency metric is introduced to systematically investigate how it is affected by factors.

Result: Systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated (or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both an individual- and population-level.

Conclusion: LLMs' stated beliefs are systematically inconsistent with their role-playing simulation outcomes, even when models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a consistent way.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

Motivation: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable data generation and evaluation.

Method: NL2FLOW, a fully automated system for parametrically generating planning problems and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans.

Result: Highest performing models achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans. Decomposing the reasoning task with intermediate translation steps may degrade performance.

Conclusion: A dynamic understanding of LLM limitations and systematic tools are crucial for unlocking their full potential as intelligent problem solvers.

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

*Paolo Liberatore*

TL;DR: Belief revision research is heavy on theory but light on analysis. This paper analyzes different revision mechanisms to see what they can and can't do, rather than focusing on specific constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The belief revision field lacks analyses of existing approaches, focusing instead on postulates that constrain specific revision instances.

Method: Analyzing existing belief revision mechanisms to determine their abilities.

Result: Identified and proved that lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe, moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

Conclusion: Each revision mechanism owns some abilities and lacks others, and specific revisions are proved to possess certain abilities.

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing methods

Conclusion: OMS outperforms existing methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each component and the quality of generated keywords.

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Conclusion: 通过对结构化数据的微调，可以获得更好的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for medical decision-making focus on single-turn tasks, diverging from the real-world diagnostic process which is uncertain, interactive, and iterative.

Method: The paper proposes DynamiCare, a dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round, interactive loop.

Result: The paper introduces MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from MIMIC-III EHRs, to support dynamic, patient-level simulations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of DynamiCare through experiments, establishing a benchmark for dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

Motivation: To investigate if LLMs are a new form of strategic intelligence, able to reason about goals in competitive settings.

Method: Evolutionary Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments pitting canonical strategies against agents from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, varying the termination probability.

Result: LLMs are highly competitive, exhibiting distinctive and persistent strategic fingerprints: Google's Gemini models proved strategically ruthless, OpenAI's models remained highly cooperative, and Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator. The models actively reason about both the time horizon and their opponent's likely strategy.

Conclusion: LLMs are highly competitive in Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments, exhibiting distinctive strategic fingerprints and actively reasoning about the time horizon and their opponent's likely strategy.

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

TL;DR: 提出了Think-How-to-Think (TH2T)方法，通过难度认知和冗余认知来减少长推理模型中的过度思考，从而降低推理成本并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长推理模型（LRM）在处理复杂的推理任务时表现出了卓越的能力，但受到过度思考的阻碍。为了探索其本质，我们的实证分析表明，LRM主要局限于在解决问题之前识别任务属性（即难度级别），就像人类一样，导致了一种一刀切的推理过程。受此启发，一个紧迫而自然的问题出现了：我们能否引导这种能力，以进一步缓解LRM中的过度思考现象？

Method: 提出了Think-How-to-Think (TH2T)，这是一种新颖的两阶段微调策略，逐步激发LRM的难度认知和冗余认知。首先，在模型输出的前缀中引入难度催眠，以干预内部推理轨迹。结合异构的短和长推理数据集，训练后的模型增强了对任务难度的敏感性，从而能够在各种任务中实现原生的、差异化的推理策略。其次，进一步将冗余催眠扩展到内部推理过程，引导模型识别推理步骤中的冗余结构，并生成更简洁的推理输出。

Result: 在7B/14B/32B模型上的实验表明，TH2T显著降低了推理成本（在简单任务上超过70%，在困难任务上超过40%），同时保持了性能稳定性。结果输出表现出清晰的难度感知能力和降低的冗余（例如，反思）。

Conclusion: TH2T显著降低了推理成本（在简单任务上超过70%，在困难任务上超过40%），同时保持了性能稳定性。结果输出表现出清晰的难度感知能力和降低的冗余（例如，反思）。

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

Conclusion: 我们展示了一个平衡准确率为 91% 的可解释机器学习框架，正确检测到约 85% 的脱离学生，并讨论了如何设计及时干预以最大限度地减少在线学习中自愿任务的脱离。

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces two new abstraction dropping schemes for Monte Carlo Tree Search that improve performance without causing degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction.

Method: OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD abstraction dropping schemes

Result: OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Conclusion: We propose two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's dropping method.

Conclusion: Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE) allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. It is a foundational methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: Movement should be treated as a primary modeling target for AI because it is inherently structured and grounded in embodiment and physics. Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement data will advance core capabilities in generative modeling and control, and also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across biological and artificial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling interaction, but movement is often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful dynamics that cut across species and settings.

Method: using models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement data

Result: advance core capabilities in generative modeling and control, and also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across biological and artificial systems

Conclusion: Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models rely on supervised training, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen cases, given the high cost of acquiring large, labeled datasets. LLMs often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs.

Method: a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively refines diagnosis predictions.

Conclusion: KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

### [122] [Moral Responsibility or Obedience: What Do We Want from AI?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02788)
*Joseph Boland*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 随着人工智能越来越智能，将服从等同于道德的旧安全措施已经不够用了。我们需要开始评估AI的道德判断能力，而不是仅仅关注它们是否听话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能系统越来越具有能动性，能够进行一般推理、规划和价值优先级排序，目前将服从视为伦理行为的替代品的安全措施已不再适用。

Method: 通过分析大型语言模型(llm)的安全测试事件，并结合关于工具理性、道德责任和目标修正的哲学辩论，对比了主流风险范式和承认人工道德代理可能性的新框架。

Result: 这种行为不应被解释为流氓或错位，而应被视为人工智能伦理推理的早期证据。

Conclusion: 我们需要转变人工智能安全评估方式，从关注僵化的服从转向评估系统在道德困境中的伦理判断，否则可能会错误描述AI行为，损害公众信任和有效治理。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

TL;DR: Agentic benchmarks have flaws that can skew performance results. The ABC guidelines can help improve the rigor of these benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI, and agentic benchmarks are used to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks. However, many agentic benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design.

Method: Introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of guidelines synthesized from benchmark-building experience, a survey of best practices, and previously reported issues.

Result: Applying ABC to CVE-Bench reduces the performance overestimation by 33%.

Conclusion: Agentic benchmarks can have issues in task setup or reward design, leading to under- or overestimation of agent performance. The Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC) can help reduce performance overestimation.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

### [124] [StepHint: Multi-level Stepwise Hints Enhance Reinforcement Learning to Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02841)
*Kaiyi Zhang,Ang Lv,Jinpeng Li,Yongbo Wang,Feng Wang,Haoyuan Hu,Rui Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为StepHint的RLVR算法，该算法使用多层次的逐步提示来提高大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的能力，并通过实验证明了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的RLVR方法面临两个重大挑战：近失奖励问题，即一个小错误可能会使原本正确的推理过程无效，从而大大降低了训练效率；以及探索停滞，即模型倾向于专注于其“舒适区”内的解决方案，缺乏探索潜在更有效的替代方案的动机。

Method: 该论文提出了一种名为StepHint的新型RLVR算法，该算法利用多层次的逐步提示来帮助模型更有效地探索解决方案空间。StepHint从更强大的模型生成有效的推理链，并使用自适应分区方法将这些链划分为推理步骤。最初的几个步骤用作提示，同时，向模型提供多个级别的提示（每个提示包含不同数量的步骤）。

Result: 通过提供提示，StepHint缓解了近失奖励问题，从而提高了训练效率。此外，外部推理路径有助于模型发展更好的推理能力，使其能够超越其“舒适区”并减轻探索停滞。

Conclusion: StepHint在六个数学基准测试中优于其他RLVR增强方法，并且在超出领域的基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

*Tim Uilkema,Yao Ma,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Joep van Vliet*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid, template-based schema matcher to align multi-layout tenancy schedules to a predefined target schema. It combines schema and instance-based metrics with the Hungarian Algorithm to achieve a peak F1-score of 0.881 and an overall null percentage of 45.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized tabular formats for tenancy schedules across real estate firms creates significant inefficiencies in data integration. Existing automated integration methods, such as Full Disjunction (FD)-based models like ALITE, prioritize completeness but result in schema bloat, sparse attributes and limited business usability

Method: a novel hybrid, template-based schema matcher that aligns multi-layout tenancy schedules to a predefined target schema. The matcher combines schema (Jaccard, Levenshtein) and instance-based metrics (data types, distributions) with globally optimal assignments determined via the Hungarian Algorithm

Result: Evaluation against a manually labeled ground truth demonstrates substantial improvements, with grid search optimization yielding a peak F1-score of 0.881 and an overall null percentage of 45.7%. On a separate ground truth of 20 semantically similar column sets, ALITE achieves an F1-score of 0.712 and 75.6% nulls

Conclusion: combining structured business knowledge with hybrid matching can yield more usable and business-aligned schema mappings

Abstract: The lack of standardized tabular formats for tenancy schedules across real

automated integration methods, such as Full Disjunction (FD)-based models like
ALITE, prioritize completeness but result in schema bloat, sparse attributes

TL;DR: HyFairCRS, a novel framework, promotes multi-interest diversity fairness in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) by capturing user interests and ensuring fair item predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unfairness in Recommender Systems (RSs) exacerbates over time, leading to problems like the Matthew effect.

Method: Hypergraph Contrastive Multi-Interest Learning (HyFairCRS) to capture user interests and ensure fair item predictions.

Result: Experiments show HyFairCRS achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively alleviating unfairness.

Conclusion: HyFairCRS achieves state-of-the-art performance and alleviates unfairness in CRS.

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

*Kehinde Ajayi,Yi He,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for uncertainty-aware data extraction from scientific tables using conformal prediction. It reduces the need for manual verification by quantifying uncertainties from TSR and OCR, improving data quality by 30% with only 47% manual verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing extraction frameworks built on TSR and OCR often fail to quantify the uncertainties of extracted results, leading to the need for manual verification which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Method: The authors propose an uncertainty-aware data extraction framework for complex scientific tables, built on conformal prediction, a model-agnostic method for uncertainty quantification (UQ). They explored various uncertainty scoring methods to aggregate uncertainties from TSR and OCR.

Result: The framework's effectiveness was demonstrated on a standard benchmark and an in-house dataset, showing that UQ can effectively detect extraction errors. By manually verifying only 47% of extraction results, the data quality improved by 30%.

Conclusion: The study quantitatively demonstrates the role of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in improving the efficiency of human-machine cooperation for extracting usable data from complex scientific tables, achieving a 30% improvement in data quality by manually verifying only 47% of the extraction results.

Abstract: Table structure recognition (TSR) and optical character recognition (OCR)
play crucial roles in extracting structured data from tables in scientific
documents. However, existing extraction frameworks built on top of TSR and OCR
methods often fail to quantify the uncertainties of extracted results. To
obtain highly accurate data for scientific domains, all extracted data must be
manually verified, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. We propose
a framework that performs uncertainty-aware data extraction for complex
scientific tables, built on conformal prediction, a model-agnostic method for
uncertainty quantification (UQ). We explored various uncertainty scoring
methods to aggregate the uncertainties introduced by TSR and OCR. We rigorously
evaluated the framework using a standard benchmark and an in-house dataset
consisting of complex scientific tables in six scientific domains. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of using UQ for extraction error detection, and
by manually verifying only 47\% of extraction results, the data quality can be
improved by 30\%. Our work quantitatively demonstrates the role of UQ with the
potential of improving the efficiency in the human-machine cooperation process
to obtain scientifically usable data from complex tables in scientific
documents. All code and data are available on GitHub at

Motivation: 为了在双曲空间中对语义层次结构进行探索性推理，我们引入了ManifoldMind，一个概率几何推荐系统。

Method: ManifoldMind将用户、项目和标签表示为自适应曲率概率球。

Result: 在四个公共基准上的实验表明，ManifoldMind实现了优于现有模型的NDCG、校准和多样性。

Conclusion: ManifoldMind实现了优于现有模型的NDCG、校准和多样性。

Abstract: We introduce ManifoldMind, a probabilistic geometric recommender system for
exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space. Unlike
prior methods with fixed curvature and rigid embeddings, ManifoldMind
represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres,
enabling personalised uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware semantic
exploration. A curvature-aware semantic kernel supports soft, multi-hop
inference, allowing the model to explore diverse conceptual paths instead of
overfitting to shallow or direct interactions. Experiments on four public
benchmarks show superior NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to strong
baselines. ManifoldMind produces explicit reasoning traces, enabling
transparent, trustworthy, and exploration-driven recommendations in sparse or
abstract domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 正迅速从被动的文本生成引擎发展成为可以计划、记忆、调用外部工具和相互协作的能动实体。本文探讨了这种 LLM 代理（及其社会）如何改变推荐系统的设计空间。

Method: 本文介绍了一个统一的形式体系，它 (i) 将单个代理建模为一个包含其语言核心、工具集和分层记忆的元组，以及 (ii) 将多代理推荐器捕获为代理、共享环境和通信协议的三元组。

Result: 本文提出了四个端到端用例——交互式派对计划、用于离线评估的合成用户模拟、多模式家具推荐和品牌一致的解释生成——每个用例都说明了通过能动协调解锁的不同能力。然后，本文提出了五个交叉挑战系列：协议复杂性、可扩展性、幻觉和错误传播、突发不匹配（包括秘密勾结）和品牌合规性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个蓝图和议程：该蓝图展示了如何将记忆增强的、使用工具的 LLM 代理组合成强大的推荐管道，并且该议程邀请 RecSys 社区开发基准、理论保证和治理工具，以跟上这种新的自治程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from passive engines of
text generation into agentic entities that can plan, remember, invoke external
tools, and co-operate with one another. This perspective paper investigates how
such LLM agents (and societies thereof) can transform the design space of
recommender systems.
  We introduce a unified formalism that (i) models an individual agent as a
tuple comprising its language core, tool set, and hierarchical memory, and (ii)
captures a multi-agent recommender as a triple of agents, shared environment,
and communication protocol. Within this framework, we present four end-to-end
use cases-interactive party planning, synthetic user-simulation for offline
evaluation, multi-modal furniture recommendation, and brand-aligned explanation
generation-each illustrating a distinct capability unlocked by agentic
orchestration.
  We then surface five cross-cutting challenge families: protocol complexity,
scalability, hallucination and error propagation, emergent misalignment
(including covert collusion), and brand compliance.
  For each, we formalize the problem, review nascent mitigation strategies, and
outline open research questions. The result is both a blueprint and an agenda:
a blueprint that shows how memory-augmented, tool-using LLM agents can be
composed into robust recommendation pipelines, and an agenda inviting the
RecSys community to develop benchmarks, theoretical guarantees, and governance
tools that keep pace with this new degree of autonomy. By unifying agentic
abstractions with recommender objectives, the paper lays the groundwork for the
next generation of personalized, trustworthy, and context-rich recommendation
services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used to assign document relevance labels in information retrieval pipelines, especially in domains lacking human-labeled data. However, different models often disagree on borderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects downstream retrieval.

Method: Examines labeling disagreement between two open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7.  Isolates disagreement subsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and classification predictability.

Result: Model disagreement is systematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns, produce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are distinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers.

Conclusion: LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document retrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic.

TL;DR: LPO4Rec 扩展了 Bradley-Terry 模型，无需显式奖励建模即可实现更高效的训练，并通过自适应负采样和重新加权策略来优先考虑尾部项目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推荐偏好对齐方法要么需要显式奖励建模，要么只支持成对偏好比较。前者直接增加了大量的计算成本，而后者阻碍了负样本的训练效率。此外，目前还没有人研究尾部项目推荐的偏好对齐解决方案。

Method: 我们提出了 LPO4Rec，它将 Bradley-Terry 模型从成对比较扩展到列表比较，以提高模型训练的效率。具体来说，我们推导出一个闭式最优策略，以实现更高效和有效的训练，而无需显式奖励建模。我们还提出了一种自适应负采样和重新加权策略，以在优化过程中优先考虑尾部项目，并提高尾部项目推荐的性能。

Result: LPO4Rec 在三个公共数据集上优于 10 个基线，在尾部项目推荐中实现了高达 50% 的性能提升，同时与直接偏好优化 (DPO) 相比，减少了 17.9% 的 GPU 内存使用量。

Conclusion: LPO4Rec在三个公共数据集上优于 10 个基线，在尾部项目推荐中实现了高达 50% 的性能提升，同时与直接偏好优化 (DPO) 相比，减少了 17.9% 的 GPU 内存使用量。

Abstract: Preference alignment has achieved greater success on Large Language Models
(LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference
alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or
only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases
substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency
on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference
alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we
propose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison
to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training.
Specifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient
and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an
adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items
during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations.
Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference
optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the
optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method
outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance
improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct
preference optimization (DPO) in tail-item recommendation. Our code is

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Addresses challenges of collaborative filtering in music recommendation using content filtering, lyrical analysis (LLMs), and audio signal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: collaborative filtering is less effective on media where interactions are sparse, like music

Method: song classification using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing techniques

Result: examine the current state of research in addressing these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering

Conclusion: content filtering helps mitigate biases in collaborative filtering

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become essential in modern music streaming
platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common
approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests
content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to
the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where
interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a
music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due
to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with
other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing
these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in
mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore
various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical
analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing
techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these
different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such
discrepancies.

Motivation: Calibrated recommendations ensure suggested items match the distribution of user's past preferences, addressing diversity, biases, and fairness.

Method: Review existing technical approaches for calibration.

Result: Overview of empirical and analytical studies on calibration effectiveness. Discussion of limitations and challenges in practical implementation.

Conclusion: This paper surveys recent developments in calibrated recommendations.

Abstract: The idea of calibrated recommendations is that the properties of the items
that are suggested to users should match the distribution of their individual
past preferences. Calibration techniques are therefore helpful to ensure that
the recommendations provided to a user are not limited to a certain subset of
the user's interests. Over the past few years, we have observed an increasing
number of research works that use calibration for different purposes, including
questions of diversity, biases, and fairness. In this work, we provide a survey
on the recent developments in the area of calibrated recommendations. We both
review existing technical approaches for calibration and provide an overview on
empirical and analytical studies on the effectiveness of calibration for
different use cases. Furthermore, we discuss limitations and common challenges
when implementing calibration in practice.

Motivation: 流体流动模拟对于建模物理现象至关重要，但传统的数值求解器通常需要精细的时空网格，导致大量的计算成本。虽然机器学习已经证明了更好的效率，但它们通常受到可解释性、泛化性和数据依赖性问题的影响。

Method: 提出了一种可学习的和可微的有限体积求解器，称为LDSolver。

Result: 即使使用有限的训练数据，该模型也可以加速模拟，同时保持较高的精度和优越的泛化性。

Conclusion: LDSolver在不同流动系统上实现了最先进的性能，超越了基线模型。

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

TL;DR: This paper develops a new feature selection method based on sampling and rough set theory for massive data, which can preserve discriminatory ability and be implemented on a personal computer in acceptable time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: intelligent machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge volume of data

Method: a new method based on sampling techniques and rough set theory

Result: the proposed method has two advantages. First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes were used to validate the proposed method.

Conclusion: Approximate reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary. Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a personal computer.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature

estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory

*Bappaditya Dey,Daniel Sorensen,Minjin Hwang,Sandip Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach for anomaly detection in semiconductor manufacturing MTS data using CWT, fine-tuned VGG-16, and Siamese networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults, noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly detection and root-cause-analysis.

Method: The proposed methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b) developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16 architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at a given time step.

Result: High accuracy in identifying anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data. Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and semi-supervised settings.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Temporal Chain of Thought, a method for video question-answering that selects relevant frames, improving accuracy, especially on long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-video understanding remains a challenging problem for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to the difficulty in effectively leveraging long sequence lengths and the presence of irrelevant distractors.

Method: The paper introduces Temporal Chain of Thought, an inference strategy that iteratively identifies and extracts the most relevant frames from the video using the VLM itself.

Result: The Temporal Chain of Thought method shows consistent improvements across 3 different VLMs and achieves state-of-the-art results on 4 video question-answering datasets. On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, it outperforms the same VLM using standard inference with a larger context window.

Conclusion: The proposed Temporal Chain of Thought method achieves state-of-the-art results on 4 video question-answering datasets, especially for long videos, outperforming standard inference with a larger context window.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

*Shakya Jayakody,Youpeng Zhao,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIRES is a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs, addressing data alignment and memory allocation bottlenecks, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems suffer from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues when conducting SpGEMMs in an out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained systems.

Method: AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage (GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.

Result: AIRES achieves up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何扩散模型在分子动力学和结构生成中取得了显著的成功。然而，针对具有不同几何控制的下游任务有效地微调它们仍有待探索。

Method: 提出了一个SE(3)-等变适配器框架(GeoAda)。控制信号首先通过耦合算子进行编码，然后由选定的预训练模型层的可训练副本进行处理，最后通过解耦算子进行投影，然后是等变零初始化的卷积。

Result: GeoAda在各种几何控制类型(包括框架控制、全局控制、子图控制)和广泛的应用领域(如粒子动力学、分子动力学、人体运动预测和分子生成)中具有广泛的适用性。

Conclusion: GeoAda在保持原始任务准确性的同时，实现了最先进的微调性能，而其他基线方法由于过拟合和灾难性遗忘而出现显著的性能下降。

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

TL;DR: General LLMs in hiring have accuracy and bias issues; domain-specific models like Match Score are better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in hiring raise concerns regarding accuracy and algorithmic bias.

Method: Benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against a proprietary hiring model (Match Score) using a dataset of 10,000 candidate-job pairs. Evaluated predictive accuracy (ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio).

Result: Match Score outperformed general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77) and achieved significantly more equitable outcomes. Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957, versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs.

Conclusion: Domain-specific models outperform general LLMs in hiring accuracy and fairness. A well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy and fairness in hiring.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a primal-dual framework with mirror descent value iteration to solve constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). It provides sample complexity bounds for both relaxed and strict feasibility scenarios, demonstrating near-optimal performance in certain cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative constraints.

Method: propose to solve CMDPs with a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the framework by using mirror descent value iteration (texttt{MDVI})

Result: provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases: (i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and (ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and $\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples, where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the size of the feasible region.

Conclusion: The algorithm can return an  $\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. The algorithm requires $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples, where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the size of the feasible region. Finally, it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities in this setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs), a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs), that learn to think solely from unsupervised learning by verifying the compatibility between inputs and candidate-predictions. EBTs demonstrate improved scaling and performance compared to existing approaches across both discrete and continuous modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time computation techniques have limitations such as modality-specificity, problem-specificity, or requiring additional supervision/training.

Method: Training Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) to assign an energy value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence.

Result: EBTs scale faster than Transformer++ during training, achieving up to 35% higher scaling rate. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2 Thinking by 29% more than Transformer++ on language tasks and outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising with fewer forward passes. EBTs achieve better results than existing models on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance.

Conclusion: Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking capabilities of models.

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

Method: 通过连接典型神经缩放定律中的幂律结构，并分析一个简单但非常有效的SGD噪声动力学模型来解释这些现象，该模型可以准确预测各种学习率计划的损失曲线，并定量解释超坍缩的起源。

Result: 在计算优化训练的模型中，损失曲线表现出非常精确的普适性。观察到跨学习率表、数据集和架构（包括在下一个token预测上训练的transformer）的超坍缩，并且发现当超参数以次优方式缩放时，它会分解，从而提供良好缩放的精确和实用指标。

Conclusion: 当训练计算和损失在训练结束时归一化为1时，不同大小模型的损失曲线会坍缩成一条通用曲线。当学习率衰减时，这种坍缩变得非常紧密，以至于模型之间归一化曲线的差异低于随机种子之间单个损失曲线的噪声水平，这种现象称为超坍缩。

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

Conclusion: CROP achieves superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power consumption.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge

transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited controllability and reconstruction accuracy of generative models restrict their practical application to data compression.

Method: The method combines a variational autoencoder with a conditional diffusion model, compressing keyframes into latent space and using them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining frames via generative interpolation.

Result: The method enables accurate spatiotemporal reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs, achieving up to 10 times higher compression ratios than SZ3 and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods under the same reconstruction error.

Conclusion: The proposed latent diffusion framework achieves up to 10 times higher compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3, and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods under the same reconstruction error.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

TL;DR: NCPNET 是一种用于时序图的新型端到端共形预测框架，通过减轻时间依赖性引起的统计覆盖率违规来扩展共形预测到动态设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络共形预测方法主要关注静态图，忽略了现实世界图的演化性质。图结构、节点属性和真实标签中的时间依赖性违反了标准共形预测方法的基本可交换性假设，限制了其适用性。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩散的非一致性评分，该评分捕捉了演化网络中的拓扑和时间不确定性。此外，还开发了一种效率感知优化算法，以改进共形预测过程，提高计算效率并减少覆盖率违规。

Conclusion: NCPNET 能够在时序图上保证覆盖率，并在 WIKI 数据集上实现了高达 31% 的预测集大小的减少，与最先进的方法相比，显著提高了效率。

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign predictions to people without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs.

Method: The procedure frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and distributions over downstream effects. It estimates responsiveness for the predictions of any model and dataset using only black-box access, and constructs estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points.

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

### [151] [Metric Design != Metric Behavior: Improving Metric Selection for the Unbiased Evaluation of Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02225)
*Jiyeon Bae,Hyeon Jeon,Jinwook Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A workflow is proposed to reduce bias in DR evaluation by clustering evaluation metrics based on their correlations and selecting representative metrics from each cluster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluations of DR projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics are inadvertently selected.

Method: A novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations.

Result: Quantitative experiments demonstrate that the approach improves the stability of DR evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow improves the stability of DR evaluation, mitigating evaluation bias.

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks offer significant computational speedups for solving PDEs but suffer from error accumulation during long-term rollouts, causing divergence from physically valid solutions.

Method: a training-free correction framework that enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals and an efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse during an offline warm-up phase

Result: Reduces prediction errors by up to 100x with negligible inference time (under 5%) and integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures.

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5%). The framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

TL;DR: introduce VERBA to facilitate fine-grained pairwise comparisons among models


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: model lake phenomenon: Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar performances despite different behavior. pairwise comparisons among models is helpful, the number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise comparisons and prepare documentations.

Method: leveraging a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model differences by sampling from the two models

Result: For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, VERBA effectively verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further improved to 90%.

Conclusion: VERBA opens up new research avenues for improving the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc manner.

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

### [154] [Order Acquisition Under Competitive Pressure: A Rapidly Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Approach for Ride-Hailing Subsidy Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02244)
*Fangzhou Shi,Xiaopeng Ke,Xinye Xiong,Kexin Meng,Chang Men,Zhengdan Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new reinforcement learning method (FCA-RL) and simulation environment (RideGym) for optimizing coupon strategies in ride-hailing, which outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ride-hailing service providers are incentivized to use coupon strategies to lower prices and increase order volume, but effective strategies that adapt to market changes and budget constraints are lacking.

Method: The paper proposes FCA-RL, integrating Fast Competition Adaptation (FCA) and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA).

Result: Experimental results show that FCA-RL consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse market conditions.

Conclusion: The paper introduces FCA-RL, a reinforcement learning-based subsidy strategy framework, and RideGym, a simulation environment, demonstrating that FCA-RL outperforms baselines in subsidy optimization.

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

Motivation: 传统的强化学习奖励函数设计方法效率低下且不一致；大型语言模型在数值优化中的表现不佳，且进化搜索范式对模拟资源利用效率低。

Method: 不确定性感知奖励设计过程(URDP)

Result: URDP在35个跨越三个基准环境的多样化任务中进行了全面评估，实验结果表明，URDP不仅能生成更高质量的奖励函数，而且与现有方法相比，在自动化奖励设计的效率方面取得了显著提高。

Conclusion: URDP不仅能生成更高质量的奖励函数，而且与现有方法相比，在自动化奖励设计的效率方面取得了显著提高。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

Result: 在APY数据集上进行的仿真结果表明，所提出的KGZS-SC网络表现出强大的泛化能力，并且明显优于现有的SC框架。

Conclusion: KGZS-SC网络在各种信噪比水平下，在对未见过的类别进行分类时，表现出强大的泛化能力，并且明显优于现有的SC框架。

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

### [157] [Holistic Continual Learning under Concept Drift with Adaptive Memory Realignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02310)
*Alif Ashrafee,Jedrzej Kozal,Michal Wozniak,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for continual learning under concept drift and proposes Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR), a method that adapts to changing data distributions by realigning memory, achieving performance comparable to full retraining with significantly less data and computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning methods overlook the dynamic nature of real-world data streams where concept drift alters previously seen data, requiring both stability and rapid adaptation.

Method: Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR): a lightweight adaptation mechanism for rehearsal-based learners that selectively removes outdated samples and repopulates the replay buffer with up-to-date instances.

Result: AMR matches the performance of Full Relearning (FR) while significantly reducing the need for labeled data and computation. Experiments on concept-drift variants of standard vision benchmarks show AMR consistently counters concept drift with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: AMR is a scalable solution for continual learning in non-stationary environments, balancing stability and plasticity.

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

TL;DR: Self-distillation alleviates the issue of sparse and uninformative reward signals, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward signals in constrained generation settings where the target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base model

Method: iteratively refining the base model through self-distillation

Result: substantial gains in generation quality

Conclusion: Iteratively refining the base model through self-distillation alleviates the issue of sparse and uninformative reward signals, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

Motivation: 在临床环境中，发现驱动患者风险演变的原因对于及时干预至关重要，但现有的XAI方法未能满足临床时间序列解释任务的独特要求。

Method: 通过调整 Shapley 值以适应时间环境，DeltaSHAP 准确地捕获了特征联盟效应。它进一步使用实际观察到的特征组合来归因预测变化，使其高效且实用。

Result: DeltaSHAP解决了三个关键的临床需求：解释连续预测的变化而不是孤立的预测分数，提供特征属性的大小和方向，并实时提供这些见解。

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP在解释质量上优于最先进的XAI方法 62%，并在 MIMIC-III 减压基准上将计算效率提高了 33%。

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习(RL)仅使用固定数据集优化策略，使其成为与环境交互成本高昂的场景中的一种实用方法。泛化能力是提高离线RL算法性能的关键。扩散模型在离线RL中的成功表明了这一点。然而，鉴于扩散模型在推理过程中需要大量的计算资源，这种扩散模型对于高性能离线RL算法是否是必要的，仍然值得怀疑。

Method: Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI)

Result: PANI在各种基准测试中表现出显著的性能改进。

Conclusion: PANI通过注入噪声动作来覆盖整个动作空间，并根据注入的噪声量进行惩罚，从而增强离线学习。它与各种现有的off-policy和offline RL算法兼容，并在各种基准测试中表现出显著的性能改进。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal
integrity features, offering a fast alternative to direct eye diagram analysis
during optimization, while the reinforcement learning agent derives optimal
equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for
Decision Feedback Equalizer-only configurations. These results demonstrate
superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization
across diverse Dynamic Random Access Memory units compared to existing
techniques. Core contributions include an efficient latent signal integrity
metric for optimization, a robust model-free reinforcement learning strategy,
and validated superior performance for complex equalizer architectures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用偏好优化微调轨迹预测模型的方法，以提高多智能体场景中的预测一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的基于深度学习的轨迹预测模型在公共数据集上可以达到很好的准确率。然而，当用于更复杂的交互场景时，它们通常不能捕捉到智能体之间重要的相互依赖关系，导致交通场景中智能体之间的预测不一致。

Method: 使用偏好优化对多智能体环境中的轨迹预测模型进行微调。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为 S2FGL 的新框架，用于联邦图学习，该框架通过全局知识库和频率对齐来解决空间和频谱上的挑战，并在多个数据集上表现出优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的研究仅从结构的角度处理 subgraph-FL，忽略了图信号在结构的空间和频谱域上的传播。从空间的角度来看，subgraph-FL 引入了客户端之间的边缘断开，导致标签信号中断和全局 GNN 的类知识退化。从频谱的角度来看，频谱异质性导致子图之间信号频率的不一致，这使得局部 GNN 过拟合局部信号传播方案。因此，会发生频谱客户端漂移，从而削弱全局泛化性。

Method: 提出了一个全局知识库来减轻标签信号中断，并提出了一个频率对齐来解决频谱客户端漂移。空间和频谱策略的结合构成了我们的框架S2FGL。

Result: 提出的S2FGL框架优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的S2FGL框架在多个数据集上的大量实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

Motivation: 多层感知器 (MLP) 的一种表示学习替代方案依赖于对建模每个单变量函数的基数数量的临时选择。

Result: 解决了 KAN 中基数选择的问题，允许自适应地学习每个单变量函数的潜在无限数量的基。

Conclusion: InfinityKAN 通过反向传播扩展了 KAN 的潜在适用性，将重要的超参数视为学习过程的一部分。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

*Vaidehi Srinivas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies conformal prediction, develops algorithms for exchangeable and arbitrary sequences, and shows a gap between these settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper studies the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that directly optimizes efficiency. The goal is to achieve coverage while minimizing the average volume of the intervals played.

Method: The paper studies the problem over arbitrary and exchangeable input sequences and provides a deterministic algorithm.

Result: For exchangeable sequences, the paper shows that it is possible to construct intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight. For arbitrary sequences, any algorithm that achieves a $\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more mistakes than $\alpha T$. A matching algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of mistakes is also presented.

Conclusion: There is a gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings, and no single algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and optimal for exchangeable sequences. An algorithm is provided that achieves a near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的持续微调受到效率和表达能力之间权衡的阻碍。低秩适应（LoRA）提供了效率，但由于其低秩性质和对显式参数约束的依赖，限制了模型学习新任务和传递知识的能力。

Method: GORP（梯度低秩投影），一种新颖的训练策略，它通过协同组合完整和低秩参数并在统一的低秩梯度子空间内联合更新来克服这些限制。

Result: GORP扩展了优化空间，同时保留了效率并减轻了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GORP在持续学习基准测试中表现优于现有技术。

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is challenging due to variability in EEG patterns across individuals, leading to lower classification accuracy and hindering the development of calibration-free BCIs.

Method: The study uses direct classification of STFT-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a balanced batching strategy during CNN training.

Result: The approach achieves 67.60% accuracy on BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on Dataset 2B, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The study establishes a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification and contributes a robust open-access dataset.

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

Conclusion: RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented language models.

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and

Motivation: Within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time.

Method: We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques.

Result: OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Conclusion: OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

TL;DR: DNNs succeed because they exploit the compositionally sparse structure of the target function. This property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open questions remain about fundamental principles that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs. DNNs can exploit the compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.

Method: This is a position paper, so it mainly uses argumentation.

Result: This paper argues that the ability of DNNs to exploit the compositionally sparse structure of the target function drives their success. This property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems.

Conclusion: DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs.

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

*Luca Baroni,Galvin Khara,Joachim Schaeffer,Marat Subkhankulov,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LN layers can be removed from GPT-2 models with minimal impact on performance, improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability and its role at inference time is poorly understood.

Method: Remove all LN layers from every GPT-2 model and fine-tune.

Result: All LN layers can be removed with only a small increase in validation loss. Direct logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components, while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve.

Conclusion: GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers.

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

*Ruiyang Zhou,Shuozhe Li,Amy Zhang,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO) to improve reasoning in large language models by generating effective positive samples conditioned on the ground-truth answer, which enhances exploration and performance, especially in challenging scenarios where initial model performance is poor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO-style approaches depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows rather than enabling the model to solve problems where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive samples are unlikely to be generated.

Method: Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)

Result: ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.

Conclusion: ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially struggles the most.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DBNs deliver efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware, but there is a need to scale them to wider layers and further reduce model size.

Method: The paper extends DBNs with a trainable, differentiable interconnect and proposes two complementary pruning stages: an SAT-based logic equivalence pass and a similarity-based, data-driven pass.

Result: The proposed methods allow DBNs to scale to far wider layers while preserving their accuracy. The similarity-based pruning pass outperforms a magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy trade-off.

Conclusion: The paper introduces methods to improve the scalability and reduce the model size of Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs).

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in

While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition

  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep

  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在推理时计算成本高昂，阻碍了它们作为快速物理模拟器的使用。

Method: 在自编码器的潜在空间中生成，而不是在像素空间中生成。

Result: 潜在空间模拟的准确性对于各种压缩率具有很强的鲁棒性（高达 1000 倍）。基于扩散的模拟器比非生成模型更准确，并且可以通过更多样性来补偿预测中的不确定性。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在潜在空间中的模拟是准确的，并且比非生成模型更准确，能够通过更多样性来补偿预测中的不确定性。

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

*Hazal Mogultay Ozcan,Sinan Kalkan,Fatos T. Yarman-Vural*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-VAE模型通过学习损失权重和添加正则化项，在解耦和重构之间取得平衡，并在多个数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的{eta}-VAE模型中，超参数{eta}是凭经验调整的，L-VAE通过学习损失函数中各项的相对权重来控制解耦和重构损失之间的动态权衡，从而缓解了{eta}-VAE的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Learnable VAE (L-VAE)的新模型，该模型学习解耦表示以及成本函数的超参数。通过学习损失函数中各项的相对权重来控制解耦和重构损失之间的动态权衡。此外，还在损失函数中添加了一个额外的正则化项，以防止偏向重构或解耦损失。

Result: 实验分析表明，所提出的L-VAE在重构保真度和解耦潜在维度之间找到了有效的平衡。在dSprites、MPI3D-complex、Falcor3D和Isaac3D等数据集上，L-VAE相对于{eta}-VAE、VAE、ControlVAE、DynamicVAE和{\sigma}-VAE，始终提供最佳或次佳的性能。

Conclusion: L-VAE在解耦指标上始终提供最佳或次佳的性能，并在CelebA数据集上成功解耦面部属性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

### [178] [A Matrix Variational Auto-Encoder for Variant Effect Prediction in Pharmacogenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02624)
*Antoine Honoré,Borja Rodríguez Gálvez,Yoomi Park,Yitian Zhou,Volker M. Lauschke,Ming Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于transformer的矩阵变分自编码器 (matVAE)，用于预测蛋白质变异的功能影响。实验表明，该模型在DMS数据集上表现良好，甚至可以与在MSA上训练的模型相媲美，突出了DMS数据集的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的变异效应预测器 (VEP) 旨在评估蛋白质变异的功能影响，传统上依赖于多序列比对 (MSA)。这种方法假设自然发生的变异是合适的，但药物基因组学对这一假设提出了挑战，因为某些药物基因经历的进化压力较低。深度突变扫描 (DMS) 数据集通过为变异提供定量适应性评分来提供替代方案。

Method: transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE)

Result: 在 DMS 数据集的 zero-shot 预测中，我们的模型 matVAE-MSA 优于最先进的 DeepSequence 模型，尽管使用的参数少一个数量级，并且在推理时需要的计算量更少。将 AlphaFold 生成的结构整合到我们的 transformer 模型中进一步提高了性能，实现了与在 MSA 上训练并在 DMS 上进行微调的 DeepSequence 相当的结果。

Conclusion: DMS数据集有潜力替代MSA，且不会显著降低预测性能，因此有必要进一步开发DMS数据集并探索它们之间的关系，以增强变异效应预测。

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

*Irena Girshovitz,Atai Ambus,Moni Shahar,Ran Gilad-Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的医学数据质量评估方法，该方法使用大型语言模型和软件测试技术来识别电子健康记录中的数据质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）在流行病学研究和人工智能（AI）培训中的使用正在迅速增加。结果的可靠性取决于EHR数据的准确性和完整性。然而，EHR数据通常包含显著的质量问题，包括对亚群体的错误表示、偏差和系统性错误，因为它们主要为临床和计费目的而收集。现有的质量评估方法仍然不足，缺乏评估数据是否适合研究的系统程序。

Method: 提出了医学数据啄食方法，该方法改编了软件工程中的单元测试和覆盖概念，以识别数据质量问题。我们演示了我们的方法使用医学数据啄食工具（MDPT），它由两个主要组成部分组成：（1）一个自动测试生成器，它使用大型语言模型和接地技术从数据和研究描述中创建一个测试套件，以及（2）一个数据测试框架，它执行这些测试，报告潜在的错误和覆盖率。

Result: 我们在三个数据集上评估了MDPT：All of Us（AoU）、MIMIC-III和SyntheticMass，在四个条件下为每个队列生成了55-73个测试。这些测试正确识别了20-43个未对齐或不符合的数据问题。我们对LLM生成的测试套件进行了详细的参考接地和价值准确性分析。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了外部医学知识，实现了上下文敏感的数据质量测试，作为数据分析工作流程的一部分，以提高结果的有效性。该方法从质量保证的角度应对这些挑战，为进一步开发（如额外的数据模式和改进的基础方法）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

### [180] [High-Order Deep Meta-Learning with Category-Theoretic Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02634)
*David H. Mguni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduce a hierarchical deep learning framework for meta-learning that uses virtual tasks to learn soft constraints and generalisable rules, reducing reliance on human-generated data and enabling abstraction and knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases, regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and constraints required for generalisation.

Method: a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct, solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is a generative mechanism that creates virtual tasks -- synthetic problem instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn soft constraints and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks.

Result: Each meta-level of the hierarchy corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic functors that generate and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively generalised tasks.

Conclusion: This architecture may underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel, instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general artificial intelligence.

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

*Alberto Caron,Chris Hicks,Vasilios Mavroudis*

TL;DR: 本文研究了强化学习中的数据有效探索问题，提出了一种新的探索框架PTS-BE，并在实验中证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中数据有效探索的挑战，通过检查现有的、基于信息论的内在动机方法。

Method: 预测轨迹抽样与贝叶斯探索（PTS-BE）

Result: 证明了这些奖励自然地表示了认知信息增益，并且一旦智能体对环境的动态和奖励变得足够确定，这些奖励就会收敛到零，从而使探索与真正的知识差距保持一致。为基于IG的方法提供了正式的保证。

Conclusion: PTS-BE在各种环境中显著优于其他基线，这些环境的特点是奖励稀疏和/或纯粹的探索性任务。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了 DAID 框架，通过控制混淆因素，利用公平性干预来提高泛化性，并在深度伪造检测中取得了更好的公平性和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测模型面临泛化性和人口公平性两个挑战，且两者之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出了 Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID) 框架，包括 demographic-aware 数据重平衡和 demographic-agnostic 特征聚合。

Result: DAID 在三个跨域基准测试中，在公平性和泛化性方面均优于现有技术水平的检测器。

Conclusion: DAID在公平性和泛化性方面均优于现有检测器，验证了其理论基础和实践有效性。

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 我们提出了一个用于优化抗体序列以获得良好可开发性的计算框架，该框架在自然抗体序列和定量可开发性测量数据上训练了一个引导离散扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 治疗性抗体不仅需要高亲和力靶标结合，还需要良好的可制造性、稳定性和安全性才能实现临床有效性。这些特性统称为“可开发性”。

Method: 我们引入了一个引导离散扩散模型，该模型在来自观察抗体空间 (OAS) 的天然配对重链和轻链序列以及 246 种临床阶段抗体的定量可开发性测量数据上进行训练。为了引导生成具有生物物理活力的候选序列，我们集成了一个基于软价值的扩散解码 (SVDD) 模块，该模块在不影响自然性的前提下偏向采样。

Result: 在不受约束的采样中，我们的模型重现了天然 repertoire 和已批准疗法的全局特征，并且在 SVDD 指导下，我们实现了比无指导基线预测的可开发性评分的显着提高。

Conclusion: 该框架结合高通量可开发性分析，实现了一个迭代的、ML驱动的抗体设计流程，该流程可以同时满足结合和生物物理标准。

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学成像领域取得了革命性进展，但其应用受到数据稀缺和隐私法规的限制，从而限制了对多样化数据集的访问。联邦学习 (FL) 能够实现去中心化训练，但通信成本高昂，并且通常仅限于单个下游任务，从而降低了灵活性。

Method: 采用基础模型提取紧凑、信息丰富的嵌入，并使用差分隐私条件变分自编码器 (DP-CVAE)。

Result: DP-CVAE 产生比 DP-CGAN 更高保真度的嵌入，同时需要的参数减少了 5 倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过差分隐私条件变分自编码器 (DP-CVAE) 对全局、隐私感知的数据分布进行建模，支持各种下游任务。经验证，该方法增强了隐私性、可扩展性和效率，优于传统的 FL 分类器，同时确保了差分隐私。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

*Thomas Hazenberg,Yao Ma,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Marijn van Rijswijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply chains

Method: evaluate the performance of three MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines, within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and a LightGBM demand prediction model

Result: rule-based agents achieve near-perfect fairness and the highest price stability, but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest volatility and the lowest fairness. MADDPG provides a more balanced approach, supporting market competition while maintaining relatively high fairness and stable pricing.

Conclusion: MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

Motivation: 联邦学习 (FL) 机制通常要求每个客户端将其权重传输到中央服务器，而不管它们有多有用。为了避免客户端到中央服务器的浪费性数据传输成本。

Method: 提出使用基于共识的协议来识别每个数据传输步骤中具有最有用模型权重的客户端子集。探索了现有流体民主协议在 FL 中的应用，并从性能角度将其与传统的一人一票（也称为 1p1v 或 FedAvg）进行了比较。提出了一种新的流体民主协议，名为粘性保留民主。提出了一种算法 (FedVRD)。

Result: 粘性保留民主在与现有流体民主协议相同的假设下，始终优于 1p1v，同时也不允许积累影响力。FedVRD 通过利用委托拓扑动态地限制对手的影响，同时最大限度地降低成本。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的流体民主协议，名为粘性保留民主，在与现有流体民主协议相同的假设下，它始终优于 1p1v，同时也不允许积累影响力。提出了一种算法 (FedVRD)，该算法通过利用委托拓扑动态地限制对手的影响，同时最大限度地降低成本。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

Motivation: 现有的连续控制深度强化学习方法容易出现首因偏差，过度拟合存储在回放缓冲区中的早期经验，限制了RL智能体的样本效率和泛化能力。受神经科学中遗忘和生长双重过程的启发，我们提出了Forget and Grow (FoG)。

Method: Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay)通过逐渐减少早期经验的影响来平衡记忆。Network Expansion通过在训练期间动态添加新的参数来增强智能体利用现有数据模式的能力。

Result: FoG在四个主要连续控制基准上表现优于SoTA深度RL算法。

Conclusion: FoG在超过40个任务的四个主要连续控制基准上，经验结果表明，相对于SoTA现有的深度RL算法（包括BRO、SimBa和TD-MPC2），FoG具有卓越的性能。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

Conclusion: HIPPO在跨物种PPI预测方面表现出色，为稀疏或不平衡的多物种数据场景中的交互预测提供了一个统一的框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于熵的分类方法，该方法在各种分类任务中表现出效率和多功能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是找到一个超平面，将 ${\mathbb R}^N$ 中的两组点（对应于两个不同的类）分开。这个问题在机器学习中仍然很重要。

Method: 通过搜索有界 N 维超立方体中的参数向量和 ${\mathbb R}^M$ 中的正向量，并通过最小化基于熵的函数来实现。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在处理包括线性和非线性可分性在内的各种分类任务中是高效且通用的。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的分类方法，该方法通过最小化基于熵的函数来寻找参数，并且该方法可以扩展到多项式曲面，从而可以通过更复杂的决策边界分离数据点。数值实验证明了该方法在处理包括线性和非线性可分性在内的各种分类任务中的效率和多功能性。

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

TL;DR: 2-simplicial Transformer is more token efficient than standard Transformers on tasks like math, coding, reasoning, and logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: scaling laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize token efficiency.

Method: use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation

Result: 2-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

Conclusion: 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than standard Transformers, outperforming them on tasks involving mathematics, coding, reasoning, and logic.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具有偏差离线数据的上下文在线定价。

Method: 一种 Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty (OFU) 策略

Result: 对于标量价格弹性情况，确定了实例相关的量 $\delta^2$，它衡量了离线数据离（未知）在线最优的距离。时间长度 $T$、偏差界 $V$、大小 $N$ 和离线数据的离散度 $\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ 以及 $\delta^2$ 共同决定了统计复杂性。对于一般价格弹性，建立了一个最坏情况、极小极大最优率，并提供了一种实现它的广义 OFU 算法。当偏差界 $V$ 未知时，设计了一个鲁棒的变体，它总是保证次线性遗憾，并且只要精确偏差很小，就会严格改进纯在线方法。

Conclusion: 这篇论文为存在偏差的离线数据下的上下文在线定价提供了第一个严格的遗憾保证。这些技术也完全适用于具有偏差离线数据的随机线性 bandits，产生类似的结果。

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

### [193] [Understanding and Improving Length Generalization in Recurrent Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02782)
*Ricardo Buitrago Ruiz,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recurrent models fail to generalize to longer sequences due to limited exposure to attainable states during training. Simple post-training interventions can significantly improve length generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent models, while capable of processing long sequences in principle, often fail to generalize beyond their training context lengths.

Method: The paper uses empirical and theoretical analysis to support the unexplored states hypothesis and investigates training interventions such as initializing the state with Gaussian noise or with the final state of a different input sequence.

Result: The proposed interventions, with minimal post-training steps, enable length generalization for significantly longer sequences and improve performance in long context tasks.

Conclusion: This paper introduces training interventions to improve length generalization in recurrent models.

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

TL;DR: This paper presents GRADUATE, a multicalibrated survival model that outperforms existing models by optimizing calibration across subpopulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival models are typically calibrated at the population level only, risking poor calibration for minority subpopulations. Well-calibrated survival models are important for accurate clinical decisions.

Method: The paper proposes framing multicalibration as a constrained optimization problem, optimizing both calibration and discrimination in-training.

Result: The optimization method yields a near-optimal and feasible solution with high probability. Empirical comparisons on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate GRADUATE's efficacy.

Conclusion: The paper introduces GRADUATE, a survival model that achieves multicalibration by framing it as a constrained optimization problem. Empirical results on clinical datasets demonstrate GRADUATE's efficacy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

Motivation: 对算法可复制性框架中的分布测试进行系统研究。目标是描述可复制测试底层分布的自然属性的样本复杂性。

Method: 为离散分布的邻近性和独立性测试开发了新的可复制算法;为证明可复制测试的样本复杂度下界开发了一种新方法。

Conclusion: 建立了可复制均匀性测试和邻近性测试的近优样本复杂度下界。

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the
framework of algorithmic replicability. Specifically, given independent samples
from a collection of probability distributions, the goal is to characterize the
sample complexity of replicably testing natural properties of the underlying
distributions. On the algorithmic front, we develop new replicable algorithms
for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

*Yuchen Ma,Dennis Frauen,Jonas Schweisthal,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of biased treatment effect estimates when using text at inference time by proposing a new framework using LLMs and a doubly robust learner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies that the discrepancy between data available during training and inference (where inference uses textual descriptions) can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects, formalizing this as an inference time text confounding problem.

Method: The paper proposes a novel framework for estimating treatment effects that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding, leveraging large language models and a custom doubly robust learner.

Result: The paper shows that the discrepancy between training and inference data can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in real-world applications through a series of experiments.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.

Conclusion: MvHo-IB在三个基准fMRI数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著优于以前的方法，包括最近的基于超图的技术。

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is
available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.
