To resolve\nthese challenges, we introduce BridgeScope, a universal toolkit bridging LLMs\nand databases through three key innovations.

However, their growing openness and\ninteraction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial\nattacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as\ndedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this\nparadigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,\nand (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,\nsystem-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents\nfurther raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose\nEvo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that\nenables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than\nrelying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to\nsimultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,\nensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.\nFurthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing\nreinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial\ntraining paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS\nperformance under co-evolving threats.

Existing methods typically leverage either global\nlow-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers\nfrom notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and\nmay disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often\nrequire extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)\nmodel that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker\ndecomposition.

Existing studies show that incorporating search signals boosts\nrecommendation performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods relies\nheavily on rich search interactions. They primarily benefit a small subset of\nusers with abundant search behavior, while offering limited improvements for\nthe majority of users who exhibit only sparse search activity. To address the\nproblem of sparse search data in search-enhanced recommendation, we face two\nkey challenges: (1) how to learn useful search features for users with sparse\nsearch interactions, and (2) how to design effective training objectives under\nsparse conditions. Our idea is to leverage the features of users with rich\nsearch interactions to enhance those of users with sparse search interactions.\nBased on this idea, we propose GSERec, a method that utilizes message passing\non the User-Code Graphs to alleviate data sparsity in Search-Enhanced\nRecommendation. Specifically, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) with\nvector quantization to generate discrete codes, which connect similar users and\nthereby construct the graph. Through message passing on this graph, embeddings\nof users with rich search data are propagated to enhance the embeddings of\nusers with sparse interactions. To further ensure that the message passing\ncaptures meaningful information from truly similar users, we introduce a\ncontrastive loss to better model user similarities.

Consequently, LLMs can\ngenerate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review\nsystematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual\naccuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset\nlimitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes\nthe need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting\nstrategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of\nthe recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and\nmitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction\ntuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG\nframeworks.

Intuitively, it has been established that the most recent\ninteractions are more indicative of future preferences than older interactions.\nMany recommendation algorithms use this notion to either drop older\ninteractions or to assign them a lower weight, so the model can focus on the\nmore informative, recent information. However, very few approaches model the\nflow of time explicitly.\n  This paper analyzes how time can be encoded in factorization-style\nrecommendation models. By including absolute time as a feature, our models can\nlearn varying user preferences and changing item perception over time. In\naddition to simple binning approaches, we also propose a novel, fully\ncontinuous time encoding mechanism. Through the use of a polynomial fit inside\nthe loss function, our models completely avoid the need for discretization, and\nthey are able to capture the time dimension in arbitrary resolution.\n  We perform a comparative study on three real-world datasets that span\nmultiple years, where long user histories are present, and items stay relevant\nfor a longer time. Empirical results show that, by explicitly modeling time,\nour models are very effective at capturing temporal signals, such as varying\nitem popularities over time. Despite this however, our experiments also\nindicate that a simple post-hoc popularity adjustment is often sufficient to\nachieve the best performance on the unseen test set. This teaches us that, for\nthe recommendation task, predicting the future is more important than capturing\npast trends. As such, we argue that specialized mechanisms are needed for\nextrapolation to future data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5206\u89e3\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b\u7edd\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u548c\u5546\u54c1\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u3002\u76f4\u89c2\u5730\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6bd4\u65e7\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u66f4\u80fd\u6307\u793a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u63a8\u8350\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u5220\u9664\u65e7\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6216\u7ed9\u5b83\u4eec\u5206\u914d\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u66f4\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u3001\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u660e\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6d41\u901d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5206\u89e3\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7edd\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u548c\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5546\u54c1\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5206\u7bb1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u5168\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7684\u9700\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u957f\u671f\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5546\u54c1\u5728\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5546\u54c1\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e8b\u540e\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u901a\u5e38\u8db3\u4ee5\u5728\u770b\u4e0d\u89c1\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5546\u54c1\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e8b\u540e\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u901a\u5e38\u8db3\u4ee5\u5728\u770b\u4e0d\u89c1\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u6bd4\u6355\u6349\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u672a\u6765\u6570\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u3002"}}

To achieve robust performance in\nmissing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i)\ncross-modal preference invariance, which ensures consistent user preference\nmodeling across varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective\nmodality representation, which filters out task-irrelevant modality information\nwhile maximally preserving essential features relevant to recommendation. By\ntreating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs\ninvariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn modality-specific item\nrepresentations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module grounded in the\nInformation Bottleneck (IB) principle extracts compact and effective item\nembeddings by suppressing modality noise and preserving core user preference\nsignals. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nMRS methods across various modality-missing scenarios, highlighting its\neffectiveness and robustness in practical applications.

While effective in low-dimensional settings,\nBO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large\nnumber of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP\nmodels. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can\nmodel complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO\napproaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model\nuncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally\nintensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these\nlimitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox\noptimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty\nestimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for\nexploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region\nto ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization\nproblems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four\nstate-of-the-art baseline algorithms.

Recently, generative recommendation\nhas emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional\nretrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic\ngeneration. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained\nby their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from\ntwo critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking\na coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement\n(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that\nlearns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core\ninnovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict\nhierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for\neach recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE\nincorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space\noverlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but\nalso promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive\nutilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled\nIDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models.

Using shape representation data with correspondences derived\nfrom Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our\ncorrespondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal\nshape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.\nWe further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream\ntasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting\nmorphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u578b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u70b9\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u65e0\u5e8f\u70b9\u4e91\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7528\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6ca1\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5f62\u72b6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u70b9\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u7684\u6d77\u9a6c\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u975e\u5e38\u903c\u771f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5065\u5eb7\u548cAD\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine\nlearning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions\nalong with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation\nperformance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists\ntumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the\nspecific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained\nsegmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable\ncombinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the\npolicy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next\nstep, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best\nlocalised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled\nmultiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its\npotential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,\nespecially when challenging pathology is present.

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate.

Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment\nPolicy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control\nbehavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.\nExperiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained\nwith MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "MERA \u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b (LRM) \u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u53d1\u5730\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8bf8\u5982\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u56de\u6eaf\u7b49\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u987f\u609f\u65f6\u523b\u201d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6d8c\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5f97\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u540e\u4ecd\u4f1a\u7ee7\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86 LRM \u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u7ee7\u7eed\u3001\u56de\u6eaf\u6216\u7ec8\u6b62\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6 (MERA)\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u660e\u786e\u5730\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0cMERA \u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a5\u7ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9\u8f85\u52a9\u6cd5\u5b66\u7855\u58eb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u663e\u5f0f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u521d\u59cb\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0cMERA \u91c7\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316 (CSPO)\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5206\u6bb5\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316 (GRPO) \u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u853d\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528 MERA \u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 MERA \u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

In these domains,\nfairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a\ncommon challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade\nAUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional\nOptimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework\nthat strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups\nusing optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable\nproportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged\ngroup. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between\nreducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance.

By selecting\npreference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are\nindicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model\nalignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across\nmultiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only\n10\\% of the original data.

Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language\nmodels to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile\nreasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether\nLMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains\nunexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability\nEvaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed\npremises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced\nLMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect\nflawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on\nexplicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects\nperformance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with\nsurface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided\nJoint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce\na Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous\nguidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors\nand thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference\nspeed.

However, existing\nbenchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and\nincomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first\ncomprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world\nhuman-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically\ndiverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential\nreasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6\nwell-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended\ncounting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction\npipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task\nselection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large\nmultimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification\nensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations\nof various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in\nstatic spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,\nmulti-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state\nrecognition and transformation sequence planning.

Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated\nremarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains\nunder-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual\nquestion answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion\nperception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically\ncoherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon\nthis foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five\ntailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive\nevaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a\nsignificant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,\ncannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process.
