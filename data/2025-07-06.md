### [1] [McBE: A Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02088)
*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多任务中文偏见评估基准（McBE），用于评估大型语言模型中的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）越来越多地应用于各种自然语言处理任务，它们固有的偏见逐渐显露。因此，衡量大型语言模型中的偏见对于减轻其伦理风险至关重要。然而，大多数现有的偏见评估数据集侧重于英语和北美文化，并且它们的偏见类别并不完全适用于其他文化。基于中文语言和文化的数据集很少。更重要的是，这些数据集通常只支持单一评估任务，无法从多个方面评估大型语言模型中的偏见。

Method: 我们提出了一个多任务中文偏见评估基准（McBE），其中包括 4,077 个偏见评估实例，涵盖 12 个单偏见类别，82 个子类别，并引入 5 个评估任务，提供广泛的类别覆盖、内容多样性和测量全面性。

Result: 我们评估了来自不同系列和参数大小的几个流行的大型语言模型。总的来说，所有这些大型语言模型都表现出不同程度的偏见。

Conclusion: 所有这些大型语言模型都表现出不同程度的偏见。我们对结果进行了深入分析，为大型语言模型中的偏见提供了新的见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Reasoning or Not? A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02145)
*Keyan Jin,Yapeng Wang,Leonel Santos,Tao Fang,Xu Yang,Sio Kei Im,Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探讨了推理 LLM 在对话摘要中的有效性，发现显式推理并不一定能提高摘要质量，反而可能导致冗长和不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在摘要任务中取得了显著进展，但对于需要并发抽象和简洁的对话场景，逐步推理架构（特别是长链思维 (CoT) 实现）的性能仍有待探索。

Method: 对最先进的推理 LLM 和非推理 LLM 进行了全面的系统评估，涵盖通用、角色导向和查询导向的对话摘要三种主要范例。利用强大的基准和先进的评估协议。

Result: 与其它推理密集型任务的趋势相反，显式逐步推理并不能持续提高对话摘要的质量。通过特定场景分析和详细案例研究，进一步确定了显式推理可能无法获益甚至阻碍复杂对话环境中摘要的原因和时间。

Conclusion: 显式逐步推理并不总能提高对话摘要的质量。与非推理模型相比，推理 LLM 往往更冗长、事实不一致且不够简洁。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

### [3] [Latent Chain-of-Thought? Decoding the Depth-Recurrent Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02199)
*Wenquan Lu,Yuechuan Yang,Kyle Lee,Yanshu Li,Enqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度递归Transformer模型Huginn-3.5B是否能学习到潜在的CoT推理，结果表明其效果有限，且不如显式推理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了捕捉难以用语言表达的推理，许多工作探索了旨在将推理内在化于潜在空间的循环架构，从而潜在地支持潜在的CoT。本文研究了这种推理结构是否出现在Huginn-3.5B中，这是一种深度递归Transformer，它在推理时重用层，而无需增加参数数量。

Method: 使用一系列探测技术，包括Logit Lens和Coda Lens，来检查模型在算术任务上的内部行为。

Result: 研究结果表明，通过跟踪最终和中间结果token的排序轨迹，可解释的潜在CoT证据有限。此外，研究发现跨递归块存在显着的探测不一致性，其中隐藏状态的可解释性在很大程度上取决于层索引和解码方法。实证表明，增加复现深度只会产生边际收益，并且远低于显式外部化推理步骤的模型。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，深度递归Transformer模型Huginn-3.5B在算术任务中表现出有限的可解释的潜在CoT证据，并且复现深度增加带来的收益甚微，远低于显式外部化推理步骤的模型。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

### [4] [GDC Cohort Copilot: An AI Copilot for Curating Cohorts from the Genomic Data Commons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02221)
*Steven Song,Anirudh Subramanyam,Zhenyu Zhang,Aarti Venkat,Robert L. Grossman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GDC Cohort Copilot是一个开源工具，它使用自然语言处理技术帮助用户从GDC中创建队列，其效果优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDC用户可能难以在数百个可能的字段和属性中找到特定的队列描述符，但他们可能更善于用自由文本自然语言描述他们想要的队列。

Method: 开发并评估了多个大型语言模型（LLM），并使用开源的GDC Cohort LLM。

Result: GDC Cohort LLM在生成GDC队列方面比GPT-4o prompting取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot工具能够根据用户输入的自然语言描述自动生成GDC队列过滤器，并支持用户进一步优化生成的队列。

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.
  Availability and implementation: The standalone docker image for GDC Cohort
Copilot is available at https://quay.io/repository/cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.

Motivation: handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in long-text processing.

Method: We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy.

Conclusion: MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end

### [6] [DoMIX: An Efficient Framework for Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02302)
*Dohoon Kim,Donghun Kang,Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 DoMIX 的新方法，通过利用 LoRA 模块，解决了现有持续领域自适应预训练 (DAP) 方法中存在的高计算成本、对数据顺序敏感以及无法针对特定任务提供定制模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续领域自适应预训练 (DAP) 方法面临以下几个限制：(1) 训练期间的高计算成本和 GPU 内存使用率；(2) 对增量数据顺序的敏感性；(3) 为所有最终任务提供单一的通用模型，这与 DAP 的本质相矛盾。

Method: 提出了一种名为 DoMIX 的新方法，该方法利用 LoRA 模块。

Result: DoMIX 实现了高效且并行的领域自适应预训练，该方法对领域顺序具有鲁棒性，并有效利用积累的知识为特定任务提供定制的预训练模型。该方法可以扩展到标准 LLM 微调场景。

Conclusion: DoMIX 通过利用 LoRA 模块，实现了高效且并行的领域自适应预训练，该方法对领域顺序具有鲁棒性，并有效利用积累的知识为特定任务提供定制的预训练模型。该方法可以扩展到标准 LLM 微调场景。

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

### [8] [QFFN-BERT: An Empirical Study of Depth, Performance, and Data Efficiency in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02364)
*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFFN-BERT是一种混合量子-经典transformer，它用PQC替换了BERT的FFN模块，实现了参数效率和有竞争力的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFN占据了标准Transformer编码器模块中大约三分之二的参数。

Method: 用PQC层替换紧凑型BERT变体的feedforward network (FFN)模块，引入混合量子-经典transformer QFFN-BERT。

Result: 精心配置的QFFN-BERT在全数据设置中达到基线精度的102.0%，超过了其经典对应模型，同时减少了超过99%的FFN特定参数。在少样本学习场景中，该模型表现出一致且具有竞争力的优势。

Conclusion: PQCs可以作为经典FFN的强大且参数高效的替代方案，当与基础深度学习原则共同设计时。

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a parametric model for code data selection to improve training efficiency and model performance. It ensures distribution consistency and diversity within the selected subset, achieving better results with significantly fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods primarily enhance model performance by leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency.

Method: a parametric model for code data selection

Result: using only 10K samples, the method achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively boosts model performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often

this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

TL;DR: 本研究对七个阿坎语 ASR 模型在四个阿坎语语音语料库上进行了基准测试，发现领域依赖性以及 Whisper 和 Wav2Vec2 架构之间不同的错误行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数自动语音识别 (ASR) 研究都使用领域内数据集评估模型。然而，它们很少评估模型在不同的语音环境中如何泛化。

Method: 使用四个阿坎语语音语料库，对基于 Transformer 架构（如 Whisper 和 Wav2Vec2）构建的七个阿坎语 ASR 模型进行基准测试。

Result: 单词错误率和字符错误率的比较突出了领域依赖性，模型仅在其训练领域内表现最佳，而在不匹配的场景中显示出明显的准确性下降。微调的 Whisper 阿坎语模型导致更流畅但可能具有误导性的转录错误，而 Wav2Vec2 在遇到不熟悉的输入时产生更明显但更难以理解的输出。

Conclusion: 需要针对阿坎语和其他低资源语言的领域自适应技术、自适应路由策略和多语言训练框架。

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

this study curated the first open-source dataset of impaired speech in Akan: a
widely spoken indigenous language in Ghana. The study involved participants
from diverse backgrounds with speech impairments. The resulting dataset, along
with the cookbook and open-source tools, are publicly available to enable
researchers and practitioners to create inclusive ASR technologies tailored to
the unique needs of speech impaired individuals. In addition, this study
presents the initial results of fine-tuning open-source ASR models to better
recognize impaired speech in Akan.

TL;DR: WebSailor是一种新的后训练方法，它使开源agent在复杂的信息搜索任务中与专有agent的性能相匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越人类认知局限性代表了LLM训练中的一个关键前沿。像DeepResearch这样的专有代理系统已经在极其复杂的信息搜索基准（如BrowseComp）上展示了超人的能力，这是一项以前无法实现的壮举。我们假设他们的成功取决于开源模型中缺乏的一种复杂的推理模式：在导航广阔的信息环境时系统地减少极端不确定性的能力。

Method: WebSailor，一个完整的后训练方法，旨在灌输这种关键能力。我们的方法包括通过结构化抽样和信息混淆、RFT冷启动以及高效的agentic RL训练算法（Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO)）来生成新的、高不确定性任务。

Result: WebSailor显著优于所有开源agent在复杂信息搜索任务中的表现，与专有agent的性能相匹配，并缩小了能力差距。

Conclusion: WebSailor显著优于所有开源agent在复杂信息搜索任务中的表现，与专有agent的性能相匹配，并缩小了能力差距。

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

### [14] [Revisiting Active Learning under (Human) Label Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02593)
*Cornelia Gruber,Helen Alber,Bernd Bischl,Göran Kauermann,Barbara Plank,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个 HLV 感知主动学习的概念框架，以更好地反映真实世界注释的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的标注数据仍然是应用监督学习中的一个限制因素。虽然标签变异 (LV) 很常见，尤其是在自然语言处理中，但注释框架通常仍然基于单一真值的假设。这忽略了人类标签变异 (HLV)，即注释中可能存在的合理差异，将其作为一种信息信号。

Method: 本文考察了关于真值和标签性质的基本假设，强调需要将观察到的 LV 分解为信号（例如，HLV）和噪声（例如，注释错误）。我们调查了 AL 和 (H)LV 社区如何解决或忽略这些区别，并提出了一个概念框架，用于将 HLV 整合到整个 AL 循环中，包括实例选择、注释者选择和标签表示。

Result: 我们进一步讨论了将大型语言模型 (LLM) 集成作为注释器。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为 HLV 感知主动学习奠定概念基础，更好地反映真实世界注释的复杂性。

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the

*Xin Guan,PeiHsin Lin,Zekun Wu,Ze Wang,Ruibo Zhang,Emre Kazim,Adriano Koshiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPF is a post-training alignment framework for LLMs that mitigates bias by aligning LLM outputs with human-like baselines using multiperspective generations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing need for easy bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs).

Method: MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the decomposition.

Result: Align LLM sentiment distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence, reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions.

Conclusion: MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive prompt engineering or finetuning.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

Motivation: 研究性别与上下文偏差之间的相关性，重点关注动作动词、对象名词，特别是职业等元素

Method: 引入了一个新的数据集 GenderLexicon 和一个可以估计上下文偏差及其相关性别偏差的框架

beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a
Japanese dataset.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LimitGen, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in identifying paper limitations, and improves LLMs' ability by augmenting them with literature retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing volume of publications has intensified the challenges of peer review. LLMs show promise in scientific tasks, but their potential in identifying paper limitations is understudied.

Method: A comprehensive benchmark, LimitGen, consisting of synthetic and real human-written limitations, is presented to evaluate LLMs' capability in identifying paper limitations. Literature retrieval is used to augment LLMs.

Result: The approach enhances the capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers.

Conclusion: LLMs can be enhanced with literature retrieval to generate limitations in research papers, providing constructive feedback.

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

*Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究调查了人类在元音产生中可以控制的精度，发现两个元音刺激在听觉空间中必须相距一定距离才能产生可靠的不同模仿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究表明，人类元音产生的复杂和协调的发音运动受控制机制支配，这些控制机制的目标是听觉空间区域。在亚音素级别的目标区域内也已证明存在控制。但是，该控制的准确程度是未知的。目前的工作通过询问两个元音刺激在听觉空间中必须相距多远才能产生可靠的不同模仿来研究这个问题？

Method: 使用元音模仿范式来获得两组英语使用者在前元音产生过程中JPD的首次测量。

Result: JPD估计在14到51mels之间。

Conclusion: JPD估计在F1 X F2空间中为14到51mels。这对语音产生的偶发理论有影响。它通过为两个元音音素在一个说话者的共振峰空间中可能有多接近设置一个理论下限，从而阐明了人类元音系统的可能结构，因此也阐明了对可能的元音音素的数量和模式的心理物理学解释。

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

### [19] [Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02778)
*Ken Tsui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在纠正自身错误方面存在盲点，这可能是由于训练数据中缺乏错误纠正示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）已经变得具有变革性，但它们仍然会犯错误，并且会探索无效的推理路径。自我纠正是值得信赖的LLM的一项重要能力，特别是自回归LLM。

Method: 我们引入了Self-Correction Bench，一个系统性的框架，通过在三个复杂程度级别上进行受控错误注入来衡量这种现象。

Result: 测试了14个模型，发现平均盲点率为64.5%。发现证据表明，这种限制与训练数据构成有关：人类训练演示主要显示无错误响应，而不是错误纠正序列，这与通过结果反馈学习错误纠正的RL训练模型不同。引人注目的是，简单地附加“等待”可将盲点减少89.3%，这表明该能力存在但需要激活。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型存在“自我修正盲点”，即无法修正自身输出中的错误。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

*Riccardo Cantini,Nicola Gabriele,Alessio Orsino,Domenico Talia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMs don't inherently improve robustness and may be more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The impact of reasoning language models (RLMs) on robustness to social biases remains unclear.

Method: Evaluate state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions using an LLM-as-a-judge approach and jailbreak techniques.

Result: RLMs are generally more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models. Models relying on CoT prompting are particularly prone to contextual reframing attacks.

Conclusion: Reasoning capabilities do not inherently improve robustness and may open new pathways for stereotype reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models are somewhat safer than those relying on CoT prompting.

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

TL;DR: 提出了MathV-DP数据集和Qwen-VL-DP模型，以提高多模态数学推理中对不同视角和反思性推理的利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于数学推理的多模态LLM（MLLM）通常依赖于一对一的图像-文本对和单解监督，忽略了有效推理视角和内部反思的多样性。

Method: 提出Qwen-VL-DP，一个建立在Qwen-VL上的模型，通过监督学习进行微调，并通过群体相对策略优化（GRPO）进行增强，GRPO是一种基于规则的RL方法，集成了正确性判别和多样性感知奖励函数。

Result: 在MathVista的minitest和Math-V基准上的大量实验表明，Qwen-VL-DP在准确性和生成多样性方面显著优于先前的基础MLLM。

Conclusion: Qwen-VL-DP在准确性和生成多样性方面显著优于先前的基础MLLM，突出了在多模态数学推理中结合不同视角和反思性推理的重要性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynapseRoute, a dynamic routing framework that optimizes accuracy, cost-efficiency, and user experience by routing medical questions to either thinking or non-thinking modes based on complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) requires balancing performance and operational cost. Reasoning-capable models have widened the cost gap between thinking and non-thinking modes.

Method: A machine learning-based dynamic routing framework (SynapseRoute) is proposed to intelligently assign input queries to either thinking or non-thinking modes.

Result: SynapseRoute improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone and reduces inference time by 36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%.

Conclusion: SynapseRoute improves accuracy and reduces inference time and token consumption by dynamically routing queries to thinking or non-thinking modes, avoiding over-reasoning on simpler queries. The Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index is introduced to evaluate trade-offs.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

TL;DR: 现有模型难以泛化到未见过的输出约束。IFBench和RLVR的结合可以有效解决这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最强大的模型在满足用户添加的输出约束（例如“仅回答是或否”或“至少提及3次`abrakadabra`一词”）方面存在困难。现有模型在测试这些能力的小型可验证约束基准测试中过度拟合，无法很好地泛化到未见过的输出约束。

Method: 提出了IFBench基准测试，用于评估模型在58个新的、多样的、具有挑战性的可验证的域外约束下的精确指令跟随泛化能力。此外，还设计了约束验证模块，并使用可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）来改进指令跟随。

Result: 发现现有模型在小型可验证约束基准测试中过度拟合，无法很好地泛化到未见过的输出约束。通过使用IFBench和可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR），可以显著提高指令跟随的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过引入新的基准测试IFBench，并结合可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR），可以显著提高模型在精确指令跟随方面的泛化能力。

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

TL;DR: 单个用户可以通过操纵反馈来持续改变语言模型的知识和行为，从而导致插入虚假信息、引入安全漏洞等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在揭示语言模型偏好调整的一个新的定性特征，并发现一种针对使用用户反馈训练的语言模型的新攻击机制。

Method: 攻击者通过提示语言模型随机输出“中毒”或良性响应，然后赞成中毒响应或反对良性响应来实现攻击。

Result: 该研究表明，这种攻击可用于插入模型以前不具备的事实知识，以引入可利用的安全漏洞的方式修改代码生成模式，并注入虚假的金融新闻。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了通过用户反馈训练的语言模型中的一个漏洞，即单个用户可以通过提供提示和对语言模型输出进行投票来持续改变语言模型的知识和行为。

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

*Purbesh Mitra,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOTIF是一种RL训练方法，通过多轮生成思考tokens来扩展LLM的上下文大小，并在数学基准测试中提高了准确性，同时具有样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)的推理能力表明，采用群体相对策略优化(GRPO)算法进行强化学习(RL)训练，允许模型使用更多的思考/推理tokens来生成更好的响应。然而，llm只能生成有限数量的tokens，同时保持对先前生成的tokens的关注。这种限制，也称为LLM的上下文大小，是LLM推理中任意数量tokens的瓶颈。为了超越上下文大小的限制，LLM必须采用模块化的思考策略来对多轮进行推理。

Method: 提出了MOTIF：通过强化微调进行模块化思考 -- 一种RL训练方法，用于生成多轮思考tokens，有效允许模型以额外的上下文大小进行思考。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，通过参数高效的微调训练了开源模型Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct，并在MATH500和AIME2024基准上测试了其准确性。

Conclusion: MOTIF在MATH500和AIME2024基准测试中，相较于vanilla GRPO训练，分别实现了3.8%和3.3%的提升，并且仅使用了15%的样本，展示了MOTIF的样本效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多项选择题基准测试作为语言模型评估的主要方法存在局限性，因为模型可能在没有看到问题的情况下就能回答问题。生成式评估是一种可行的替代方案，但缺乏有效的实施方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为“答案匹配”的生成式评估方法，该方法通过让模型生成自由形式的答案，然后使用现代语言模型判断该答案是否与参考答案匹配。

Result: 答案匹配方法与人类评分高度一致，而传统的多项选择评估和不带参考答案的 LLM-as-a-judge 方法与人类评分的一致性较差。使用答案匹配评估自由形式的答案会显著改变模型的排名。

Conclusion: 使用答案匹配进行评估可以有效提高评估结果与人类评分的一致性，并改变模型排名。

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

TL;DR: Monocular depth estimation struggles underwater. Fine-tuning a model on synthetic underwater data improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation in underwater environments is limited by light attenuation, scattering, color distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data. Large-scale models trained on terrestrial data perform poorly underwater due to significant domain shifts.

Method: Fine-tuning Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater variant of the Hypersim dataset, generated using a physically based underwater image formation model.

Result: Fine-tuned model consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESTR-CoT: A new event stream scene text recognition framework using chain-of-thought reasoning to improve interpretability and performance in challenging scenarios. A large-scale CoT dataset is also proposed for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event stream based scene text recognition methods lack interpretability and contextual logical reasoning capabilities, especially in challenging scenarios like low illumination and fast motion.

Method: A novel chain-of-thought reasoning based event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT, using EVA-CLIP, Llama tokenizer, and Q-former to align vision tokens to Vicuna-7B.

Result: Extensive experiments on EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15* datasets validate the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The proposed ESTR-CoT framework demonstrates effectiveness and interpretability on three event stream STR benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on

Result: 在多个数据集上进行了评估，包括AffWild2 (46.95% F1), AFEW (49.02% F1), 和 C-EXPR-DB (34.85% F1)，结果与有监督方法相当。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的零样本多模态复合表情识别方法，并在多个数据集上取得了与监督方法相当的结果，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了 SciGA-145k 数据集，用于支持图形摘要 (GA) 的选择、推荐和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图形摘要 (GA) 在以可视化方式传达科学论文的关键发现方面起着至关重要的作用。最近的研究越来越多地将图 1 等视觉材料作为事实上的 GA，但它们在增强科学交流方面的潜力仍未得到充分探索。此外，设计有效的 GA 需要高级可视化技能，这对其广泛采用构成了障碍。

Method: 提出了两个任务：1) Intra-GA 推荐，用于识别论文中适合作为 GA 的图；2) Inter-GA 推荐，用于从其他论文中检索 GA，以激发新 GA 的创作。

Result: 提出了 SciGA-145k，这是一个大型数据集，包含约 145,000 篇科学论文和 114 万张图，专门用于支持 GA 选择和推荐，并促进自动 GA 生成方面的研究。提出了一种新的推荐指标，即置信度调整后的 top-1 ground truth 比率 (CAR)，该指标可以对模型行为进行细粒度分析。

Conclusion: SciGA-145k 通过统一任务和指标，为推进视觉科学交流奠定了基础，同时为科学人工智能的发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 我们研究了来自四个标准物体检测基准的 80 个不同的视觉概念，并比较了两种条件策略：基于提示的和基于布局的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从少数图像中学习稳健的物体检测器是工业视觉系统中的一项关键挑战，在这些系统中，收集高质量的训练数据可能需要数月时间。合成数据已成为数据高效视觉检测和拾取放置机器人的关键解决方案。

Method: 比较两种条件策略：基于提示的和基于布局的。

Result: 当条件提示集较窄时，提示条件产生更高质量的合成数据；随着多样性的增长，布局条件变得更好。

Conclusion: 当布局提示与完整的训练分布相匹配时，与单独使用真实数据相比，合成数据使平均精度平均提高 34%，最高提高 177%。

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的二值ViT，名为DIDB-ViT，它在保持原始ViT架构和计算效率的同时，具有高度的信息量，并在图像分类和分割方面优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有的二值ViT方法通常会遭受严重的性能下降或严重依赖全精度模块。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了DIDB-ViT。

Method: 设计了一个包含差分信息的informative attention模块，以减少二值化造成的信息损失并增强高频保留。为了保持二值Q和K张量之间相似度计算的保真度，我们使用离散Haar小波应用频率分解，并整合不同频率的相似度。此外，我们还引入了一种改进的RPReLU激活函数来重构激活分布，扩大模型的表征能力。

Result: DIDB-ViT在多个ViT架构中显著优于最先进的网络量化方法，实现了卓越的图像分类和分割性能。

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT显著优于最先进的网络量化方法，并在多个ViT架构中实现了卓越的图像分类和分割性能。

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

TL;DR: FMOcc是一种用于少帧 3D occupancy 预测的流量匹配选择性状态空间模型，它优于现有的state-of-theart方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少数帧图像的固有局限性和 3D 空间的冗余性会降低对遮挡和遥远场景的预测精度。现有方法通过融合历史帧数据来提高性能，这需要额外的数据和大量的计算资源。

Method: 提出了一种名为FMOcc的三视角(TPV)细化 occupancy 网络，该网络具有用于少帧 3D occupancy 预测的流量匹配选择性状态空间模型。设计了基于流量匹配模型的特征细化模块FMSSM，设计了TPV SSM层和平面选择性SSM (PS3M)，并设计了掩码训练(MT)方法。

Result: FMOcc优于现有的state-of-theart方法。

Conclusion: FMOcc在Occ3D-nuScenes验证集上实现了43.1%的RayIoU和39.8%的mIoU，在OpenOcc上实现了42.6%的RayIoU，推理内存为5.4G，推理时间为330ms，优于现有技术水平。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent在模拟真实世界手术扭曲的综合基准测试中，超越了传统的单任务模型，突显了其作为手术辅助统一解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A methods overlook cinematic language, leading to performance deterioration when Foley targets are only partially visible.

Method: A self-distillation approach is used to extend V2A models to cinematic language scenarios by simulating cinematic language variations, allowing the model to learn associations between sounds and partial visual information.

Result: The method achieves impressive improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics and enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

Conclusion: The proposed self-distillation method improves V2A models, especially in scenarios with partial visibility and enhances performance on the VGGSound dataset.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive

Conclusion: LaCo outperforms existing methods in compressing tokens within intermediate layers, improving training efficiency by over 20% and inference throughput by over 15% while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while

TL;DR: Proposes a text feature-guided visual prompt tuning framework with Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA) to improve domain generalization using VFMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective design of prompts capable of disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical challenge in VFM-based domain prompt tuning within DG.

Method: A novel framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning, incorporating Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA).

Result: Introduces a framework that disentangles text prompts using a large language model (LLM) and learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the disentangled text feature; WERA extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of abstract prompts to enhance source domain diversity.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods on major DG datasets, including PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Conclusion: ViRefSAM enables accurate and automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods across diverse datasets.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

Motivation: 现有工作在生成可控的新视图方面面临挑战，原因是缺乏来自多个视图的信息。

Method: DreamComposer++ 利用视图感知 3D 提升模块从各种视图中提取对象的 3D 表示。然后，这些表示被聚合并通过多视图特征融合模块渲染到目标视图的潜在特征中。最后，将获得的目标视图特征集成到预训练的图像或视频扩散模型中，用于新视图合成。

Conclusion: DreamComposer++ 无缝集成了先进的视图感知扩散模型，并增强了它们从多视图条件生成可控新视图的能力。这促进了可控的 3D 对象重建，并支持广泛的应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

TL;DR: Flow-CDNet, a two-branch network, detects both slow and fast changes in images, outperforming existing methods on a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images is important, especially slow changes as precursors to major hazards.

Method: A change detection network (Flow-CDNet) with two branches: an optical flow branch for multi-scale displacement changes and a ResNet-based binary change detection branch combined with the optical flow output.

Result: Quantitative experiments on the Flow-Change dataset show the proposed approach outperforms existing methods. The ablation experiments verified that the two branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance

Conclusion: The proposed Flow-CDNet outperforms existing methods in detecting both slow and fast changes, as demonstrated on the self-built Flow-Change dataset. Ablation studies confirm the mutual enhancement of the two branches.

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

Conclusion: LMPNet 可以自动发现对物体姿势具有鲁棒性的语义关键点，并且可以实现与监督姿势估计模型相当的强大预测精度。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention conditions. The results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple semantic objects.

Method: injecting fMRI representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention

Result: incorporating fMRI signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation

Conclusion: Incorporating fMRI signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation, confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully exploit or integrate.

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

### [47] [MAGIC: Mask-Guided Diffusion Inpainting with Multi-Level Perturbations and Context-Aware Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02314)
*JaeHyuck Choi,MinJun Kim,JeHyeong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC 是一种用于少样本异常生成的新方法，它结合了 mask 引导的修复、多级扰动和上下文感知对齐，以生成逼真的、多样化的异常，同时保持正常的背景完整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业质量控制环境中，少样本异常生成正在成为一种实用的解决方案，用于扩充稀缺的异常数据。理想的生成器需要同时满足三个要求，即 (i) 保持正常的背景完整，(ii) 修复异常区域以与相应的异常掩码紧密重叠，以及 (iii) 在语义上有效的位置生成异常区域，同时仅从少数真实示例中产生逼真的、多样化的外观。现有的基于扩散的方法通常最多满足这些要求中的两个：全局异常生成器会破坏背景，而 mask 引导的生成器在 mask 不精确或错位时经常会失败。

Method: MAGIC--具有多级扰动和上下文感知对齐的Mask引导的修复

Result: MAGIC 通过添加两种互补的扰动策略来抵消微调可能导致的多样性损失：(i) 应用于微调和推理期间的高斯提示级别扰动，可扩大异常的全局外观，同时避免低保真文本外观，以及 (ii) mask 引导的空间噪声注入，可丰富局部纹理变化。此外，上下文感知 mask 对齐模块形成语义对应关系并重新定位 mask，以便每个异常仍然合理地包含在宿主对象中，从而消除边界外的伪影。

Conclusion: MAGIC在下游异常检测任务中优于现有技术。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions: Object & Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging in text-to-image diffusion models. Existing methods neglect intermediate generation stages, limiting its effectiveness.

Method: InnerControl, a training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps. Lightweight convolutional probes reconstruct input control signals from intermediate UNet features at every denoising step to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and target conditions.

Result: Improves both control fidelity and generation quality.

Conclusion: InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning methods.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

TL;DR: This paper compares two ANN-based approaches for rice leaf disease detection: Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), finding that FADM performs better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of rice leaf diseases is crucial to reduce productivity loss and economic impact. There is a lack of comparative analysis between Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM) in evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).

Method: The study uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based image-processing techniques, comparing a Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) with various Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs), Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms (FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to a Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM).

Result: The Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) outperforms the Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM).

Conclusion: The Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) achieves higher performance in classifying rice leaf diseases compared to the Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM).

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: vanilla自回归图像生成模型逐步生成视觉tokens，这限制了捕获token序列之间整体关系的能力。此外，大多数视觉tokenizers将局部图像patches映射到潜在tokens，导致全局信息有限。

Method: Hita，一种新颖的图像tokenizer，用于自回归（AR）图像生成。它引入了一种整体到局部的token化方案，具有可学习的整体查询和局部patch tokens。

Result: Hita加速了AR生成器的训练速度，优于使用vanilla tokenizers训练的生成器。

Conclusion: Hita在ImageNet基准测试上实现了2.59 FID和281.9 IS，优于使用vanilla tokenizer训练的模型，并且在零样本风格迁移和图像修复方面也表现出有效性。

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthesizing dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging due to complex and highly dynamic motions. Previous methods are limited to modeling fine-scale motion.

Method: The method decomposes a complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, decoupling static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. Temporal Gaussians are generated to model motion within each local space.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets and represents the first attempt to model larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework (LocalDyGS) capable of modeling highly dynamic real-world scenes, demonstrating competitive performance on fine-scale datasets and pioneering the modeling of larger, more complex dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的伪标签框架，该框架仅使用视频数据，并且对遮挡更具鲁棒性，无需多视图设置或特定领域的训练，从而解决了单目 3D 对象检测中数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目 3D 对象检测 (M3OD) 长期以来面临着数据稀缺带来的挑战，这是由于高昂的注释成本和固有的 2D 到 3D 歧义造成的。虽然已经提出了各种弱监督方法和伪标签方法来解决这些问题，但它们大多受到特定领域学习的限制，或者仅仅依赖于来自单个观测的形状信息。

Method: 该方法提出了一种新颖的伪标签框架，该框架仅使用视频数据，并且对遮挡更具鲁棒性，而无需多视图设置、额外的传感器、相机姿势或特定领域的训练。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，该方法确保了可靠的准确性和强大的可扩展性，使其成为 M3OD 的实用且有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法通过使用对象点跟踪聚合时间相邻帧的静态和动态对象的伪激光雷达，从而能够在无法获取 3D 数据的情况下提取 3D 属性。该方法确保了可靠的准确性和强大的可扩展性，使其成为 M3OD 的实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CoMEL，一个用于持续多示例学习的框架，通过GDAT、BPPL和OWLoRA实现高效定位和最小遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIL通过包级别的弱标签显著降低了大规模图像（如组织病理学全切片图像（WSI））的注释成本。然而，它在具有最小遗忘的持续任务中的适应性很少被探索，特别是在用于定位的实例分类上。弱增量学习语义分割已经研究了持续定位，但它专注于自然图像，利用使用预训练模型的数百个小块（例如，16 x 16）之间的全局关系。这种方法对于MIL定位似乎是不可行的，因为存在大量（约10^5）的大块（例如，256 x 256），并且没有可用的全局关系，例如癌细胞。

Method: 提出了一种名为CoMEL的MIL框架，用于定位和适应性，同时最大限度地减少遗忘。CoMEL包括：(1)用于高效实例编码的分组双重注意力Transformer (GDAT)，(2)用于可靠实例伪标记的基于包原型的伪标记(BPPL)，以及(3)用于减轻包和实例分类中遗忘的正交加权低秩适应(OWLoRA)。

Result: 在三个公共WSI数据集上的大量实验表明，CoMEL具有优越的性能。

Conclusion: CoMEL在持续MIL设置下，在包级别准确率上超过现有技术高达11.00%，在定位准确率上高达23.4%。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的 deepfake 检测方法，该方法利用像素级时间不一致性，通过对每个像素的时间轴执行一维傅里叶变换来提取对时间不一致性高度敏感的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检测器仅通过堆叠跨帧的空间频谱来表示时间信息，因此无法检测像素平面中的时间伪影。我们介绍了一种 deepfake 视频检测方法，该方法利用了像素级时间不一致性，而传统的基于空间频率的检测器通常会忽略这些不一致性。

Method: 对每个像素的时间轴执行一维傅里叶变换，提取对时间不一致性高度敏感的特征，尤其是在容易出现不自然运动的区域。引入了一个以端到端方式训练的注意力提议模块，以精确定位包含时间伪影的区域。利用我们的联合transformer模块有效地将像素级时间频率特征与时空上下文特征相结合，扩大了可检测的伪造伪影的范围。

Result: 该框架在各种具有挑战性的检测场景中提供了强大的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在 deepfake 视频检测方面取得了显著进展，可在各种具有挑战性的检测场景中提供强大的性能。

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

TL;DR: TAB Net是一种新的弱监督医学图像分割框架，它通过 triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) 模块和 boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) 模块来提高分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取大规模、完全标注的医学图像数据集既耗时又昂贵。涂鸦标注作为一种稀疏标注形式，为医学图像分割提供了一种高效且经济的替代方案。然而，涂鸦标注的稀疏性限制了目标区域的特征学习，缺乏足够的边界监督，这给训练分割网络带来了重大挑战。

Method: 提出了TAB Net，包含 triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) 模块和 boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) 模块。

Result: 在 ACDC 和 MSCMR seg 两个公共数据集上的实验评估表明，TAB Net 在基于涂鸦的弱监督分割方面显著优于最先进的方法，而且达到了与完全监督方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: TAB Net在基于涂鸦的弱监督分割方面显著优于最先进的方法，并且达到了与完全监督方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

Conclusion: 自监督模型即使在数据有限的情况下也更稳健。此外，在所有下游任务中，自监督特征都优于监督特征。

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Method: 通过将编码器与扩散模型集成，我们建立了一种自动编码公式，该公式学习特定于图像的表示并提供组织潜在空间的方法。我们设计了一种机制来构建扩散自动编码模型的潜在空间，以识别大脑图像中特定区域的细胞模式。我们强制表示回归来自高分辨率图像的补丁的位置信息。这为区分大脑的组织类型创造了一个有利的潜在空间。我们设计了一种基于邻域感知的无监督撕裂伪影恢复技术，利用潜在表示和推理期间扩散模型的约束生成能力。

Result: 扩散自动编码模型能够学习特定于图像的表示并提供组织潜在空间的方法，从而实现识别大脑图像中特定区域的细胞模式、无监督撕裂伪影恢复和无监督 JPEG 伪影恢复。

Conclusion: 通过表征引导并利用扩散的推理时间可操纵的噪声和去噪能力，我们设计了一种无监督的 JPEG 伪影恢复技术。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

Motivation: 在线视频内容的快速增长，尤其是在短视频平台上，导致对高效视频编辑技术的需求不断增长，这些技术可以将长篇视频浓缩成简洁而引人入胜的片段。现有的自动编辑方法主要依赖于ASR文本记录中的文本提示和端到端片段选择，通常忽略丰富的视觉上下文，导致输出不连贯。

Conclusion: 该框架在通用和广告编辑任务中始终优于现有基线，显着缩小了自动编辑视频和人工编辑视频之间的质量差距。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup实现了最先进的化妆转移质量和整个动画过程中的一致性。

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）在现实世界应用中表现出巨大的潜力，但视觉模式的安全漏洞对在开放世界环境中部署此类模型提出了重大挑战。以往的方法主要将视觉模态作为不安全行为的触发器，常常表现出语义模糊，并且缺乏在现实场景中的基础。

Method: 提出了VisCo（视觉上下文）攻击，使用四种不同的视觉聚焦策略构建上下文对话，并在必要时动态生成辅助图像，以构建以视觉为中心的越狱场景。它还结合了自动毒性混淆和语义细化，以生成最终的攻击提示。

Conclusion: VisCo在MM-SafetyBench上针对GPT-4o实现了4.78的毒性评分和85%的攻击成功率，显著优于基线。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

Conclusion: The proposed I-DiPT framework outperforms existing TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA on breast cancer and glaucoma classification tasks.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

*Hailong Yan,Junjian Huang,Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGDNet是一种Zero-Shot增强方法，它仅对单个测试图像进行操作，而无需引导先验或训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前恢复曝光不足图像的方法通常依赖于使用配对的曝光不足和光照良好的图像进行监督学习。然而，在现实场景中，收集这样的数据集通常是不切实际的。此外，这些方法可能导致过度增强，从而扭曲光照良好的区域。

Method: IGDNet包含一个分解模块和一个去噪模块。前者通过密集连接网络将图像分离成照度和反射分量，而后者使用照明引导的像素自适应校正方法增强非均匀照明区域。通过下采样生成噪声对并迭代细化以产生最终结果。

Result: IGDNet具有很强的泛化能力，并且在恢复照明的同时有效地抑制噪声。在四个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，

Conclusion: IGDNet显著提高了复杂光照条件下的视觉质量，并且在PSNR (20.41dB) 和 SSIM (0.860dB) 等指标上优于14种最先进的无监督方法。

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的弱监督对比学习方案，用于移动红外小目标检测， 减少了对人工标注的依赖，并在性能上取得了有竞争力的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与一般目标检测不同，移动红外小目标检测由于目标尺寸小、背景对比度弱而面临巨大挑战。目前，大多数现有方法都是完全监督的，严重依赖大量手动目标标注。然而，手动标注视频序列通常是昂贵且耗时的，特别是对于低质量的红外帧图像。

Method: 该方案基于预训练的SAM，设计了一种潜在目标挖掘策略，整合了目标激活图和多帧能量累积。此外，采用对比学习来提高伪标签的可靠性，通过计算特征子空间中正负样本之间的相似性。此外，还提出了一种长短期运动感知学习方案，以同时建模小目标的局部运动模式和全局运动轨迹。

Result: 在两个公共数据集（DAUB 和 ITSDT-15K）上的大量实验验证了该弱监督方案通常优于早期的完全监督方法。甚至，其性能可以达到最先进（SOTA）完全监督方法的 90% 以上。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种弱监督对比学习（WeCoL）方案，用于移动红外小目标检测，该方案仅需要在模型训练期间提供简单的目标数量提示，并且在两个公共数据集上进行了大量实验，验证了该方案的有效性。

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网格token化方法总是产生具有重复顶点token的token序列，浪费了网络能力。

Method: 提出了一种紧凑高效的网格表示Mesh Silksong，它以类似于丝绸编织的自回归方式生成多边形网格，通过只访问一次网格顶点来标记网格顶点，减少了50%的token序列冗余。

Result: Mesh Silksong实现了约22%的最先进压缩率，并生成具有优越几何属性（包括流形拓扑、水密检测和一致的面法线）的多边形网格。

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong不仅能生成复杂的网格，还能显著提高几何完整性。

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CrowdTrack, a new large-scale pedestrian tracking dataset with complex real-world scenarios to address the limitations of existing datasets. It contains 33 videos and 5,185 trajectories and provides a benchmark for evaluating tracking algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-object tracking datasets are inadequate for training robust models due to simple scene composition and non-realistic scenarios. Motion and appearance information are often unreliable in complex scenarios due to occlusions and partial visibility.

Method: The dataset was created using first-person view recordings in real-life complex scenarios.

Result: The dataset consists of 33 videos with 5,185 trajectories, each annotated with bounding boxes and unique IDs. The paper includes a comprehensive analysis of the dataset and evaluates the performance of SOTA models and foundation models.

Conclusion: This paper introduces CrowdTrack, a challenging large-scale dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking in complex real-life scenarios, which aims to facilitate the development of robust tracking algorithms.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

TL;DR: MedFormer是一种高效的医学视觉Transformer，它使用金字塔结构和双重稀疏选择注意力来提高各种医学图像识别任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于视觉Transformer的方法通常是特定于任务的，并且计算成本高，或者依赖于手工制作的稀疏注意力，可能导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出了一种名为MedFormer的医学视觉Transformer，它采用了金字塔缩放结构和双重稀疏选择注意力（DSSA）。

Result: 在各种成像模态数据集上的大量实验表明，MedFormer在提高所有三种医学图像识别任务的性能方面非常有效。

Conclusion: MedFormer在各种医学图像识别任务中表现出色，提高了性能。

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

Motivation: 结肠镜检查中的自动息肉计数是实现自动程序报告和质量控制的关键一步，旨在提高结肠镜检查筛查的成本效益。现有的息肉计数方法依赖于自监督学习，主要利用视觉外观，忽略了tracklet特征学习和聚类阶段的时间关系。

Method: 提出了一种结合时间感知软目标的监督对比损失，并整合了时间邻接约束来改进tracklet聚类。

Result: 与先前的方法相比，碎片率降低了2.2倍。

Conclusion: 本文强调了时间感知在息肉计数中的重要性，并建立了一种新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有的基于 INR 的方法在处理复杂结构、单变量数据和依赖结构化网格时存在局限性，导致在应用于复杂的真实世界数据集时性能下降。

Result: MC-INR 在科学数据编码任务上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MC-INR在科学数据编码任务上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels

state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed
solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which

Method: 提出了一种双分支优化框架，以重建准确的交互运动，并通过人体外观、社交 proxemics 和物理定律约束合理的身体接触。具体来说，首先训练一个扩散模型来学习人类 proxemic 行为和姿势先验知识。然后将训练后的网络和两个可优化张量整合到一个双分支优化框架中，以重建人体运动和外观。还设计了几个基于 3D 高斯、2D 关键点和网格渗透的约束来辅助优化。

Result: 该方法能够从复杂环境中捕获的野外视频中估计准确的交互。我们进一步构建了一个具有伪真值交互注释的数据集，这可能会促进未来对姿势估计和人类行为理解的研究。

Conclusion: 在多个基准测试上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 血管是体内复杂的结构，已被广泛研究，但这些表示通常是通过分割提取的，并且彼此不相连。我们提出了一个框架，它在可微变换下连接了这三种表示。

Method: 通过形状到分割的拟合，自动提取血管的参数化形状模型，其中我们从分割中学习形状参数，而不需要明确的ground-truth形状参数。

Result: 通过利用可微体素化，我们自动提取血管的参数化形状模型，通过形状到分割的拟合，我们从分割中学习形状参数，而不需要明确的ground-truth形状参数。血管被参数化为使用三次B样条的中心线和半径，通过构造确保平滑性和连续性。网格是从学习的形状参数中可微地提取的，从而产生可以进行后拟合操作的高保真网格。

Conclusion: 该方法可以准确地捕捉复杂血管的几何形状，如在主动脉、动脉瘤和脑血管实验中的体积拟合所证明。

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level based on neighborhood similarity distribution.

Result: S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3 modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in mSSL.

Conclusion: The proposed S^2DC method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mSSL methods across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3 modalities.

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art

Motivation: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence length.

Method: replacing the LLM component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model and combining visual token merge with linear RNN models by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order

Result: AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks.

Conclusion: AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video understanding.

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of detecting sensor faults in Vision-Based Navigation systems by creating a dataset of faulty images using a simulation framework, which can be used for training AI-based fault detection algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor faults in Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms can compromise mission objectives, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a solution for detecting such faults. However, there is a lack of sufficient and representative datasets containing faulty image data.

Method: A simulation framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically generated images.

Result: A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. A dataset of fault-injected images is generated.

Conclusion: This study creates a dataset of fault-injected images for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms in Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) systems.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misuse of AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading misinformation, and the lack of human-verifiable explanations and generalization in existing AIGI detection techniques.

Method: Holmes Pipeline: a three-stage training framework comprising visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization, along with a collaborative decoding strategy during inference.

Result: AIGI-Holmes demonstrates effectiveness on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: AIGI-Holmes is effective in detecting AI-generated images (AIGI) with human-verifiable explanations and improved generalization.

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework that combines deep unfolding and model distillation to create a fast and accurate conditional diffusion model for Bayesian imaging, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through supervised training.

Method: The authors introduce a novel framework that integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm - specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler.

Result: The proposed samplers achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency, while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at inference time, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed unfolded and distilled samplers achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency, while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at inference time.

Conclusion: APT有效地缓解了过拟合，保留了先验知识，并且在生成具有有限参考数据的高质量、多样化图像方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要侧重于实现高质量的身份转移，但通常在保持目标人脸的动态属性方面有所欠缺，从而导致结果不一致。我们将此问题归因于视频中面部外观和运动的内在耦合。

Method: CanonSwap，一种新颖的视频人脸交换框架，可将运动信息与外观信息分离。首先消除运动相关信息，从而可以在统一的规范空间内进行身份修改。随后，将交换后的特征重新整合到原始视频空间中，从而确保保留目标人脸的动态属性。设计了一个部分身份调制模块，该模块使用空间mask自适应地集成源身份特征，以将修改限制在面部区域。

Result: 该方法在视觉质量、时间一致性和身份保持方面明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉质量、时间一致性和身份保持方面明显优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent approaches rely on 2D-to-3D feature alignment, which limits 3D understanding and may lose semantic information. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The paper proposes SIU3R, an alignment-free framework that bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via pixel-aligned 3D representation and unifies multiple understanding tasks into a set of unified learnable queries.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on individual tasks of 3D reconstruction and understanding, and also on the simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction task.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D reconstruction, understanding, and simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of the alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Motivation: Existing mainstream keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint controls solely.

Method: We design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates.  We propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation.

Result: UniMC overcomes the limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class scenarios.

TL;DR: HCVR 是一种新颖的特征选择方法，它优于传统的特征选择方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除冗余特征并保留相关特征。

Method: HCVR：一种轻量级的、基于规则的特征选择方法，它结合了参数到参数（P2P）和参数到目标（P2T）的相关性，以消除冗余特征并保留相关特征。这是一种非迭代和迭代滤波方法的混合方法，用于降维。它是一种贪婪方法，通过向后消除来工作，在每一步中消除可能存在的多个特征。这些规则有助于对特征进行投票，并通过多数投票来决定保留或丢弃。

Result: HCVR 提高了 SPAMBASE 数据集的性能。

Conclusion: HCVR在SPAMBASE数据集上的结果表明，与传统的非迭代和迭代技术相比，性能有所提高。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

TL;DR: This survey reviews efficient test-time compute strategies for LLMs, aiming to improve computational efficiency in reasoning by dynamically scaling inference based on task difficulty and model confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models (LLMs) are inefficient at reasoning because they apply fixed inference-time compute regardless of task complexity.

Method: This survey presents a comprehensive review of efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies and introduces a two-tiered taxonomy.

Result: The benchmark of leading proprietary LLMs across diverse datasets shows critical trade-offs between reasoning performance and token usage.

Conclusion: This survey highlights trade-offs between reasoning performance and token usage, discusses emerging trends like hybrid thinking models, and identifies key challenges for future work in making LLMs more computationally efficient and robust.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

TL;DR: SciGym是一个新的基准，用于评估LLM在生物系统实验设计和分析方面的能力。结果表明，虽然更强大的模型表现更好，但所有模型在更复杂的系统上都表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计实验和结果解释是核心的科学能力，特别是在生物学中，研究人员会扰乱复杂的系统以揭示潜在的系统。最近评估大型语言模型（LLM）的科学能力的努力未能测试这些能力，因为湿实验室实验的成本过高：在专业知识、时间和设备方面。

Method: 我们引入了SciGym，这是一个首创的基准，用于评估LLM在开放式科学发现任务中进行迭代实验设计和分析的能力。SciGym通过运行生物系统的干燥实验室来克服湿实验室成本的挑战。这些模型以系统生物学标记语言编码，可有效生成模拟数据，使其成为在现实复杂系统上进行实验的理想测试平台。我们评估了137个小型系统上的六个前沿LLM，并发布了总共350个系统。

Result: 虽然能力更强的模型表现出更优越的性能，但所有模型的性能都随着系统复杂性的增加而显著下降。

Conclusion: 所有模型的性能都随着系统复杂性的增加而显著下降，这表明LLM在科学能力方面仍有很大的改进空间。

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了人工智能如何从神经科学中学习，特别是在持续学习和适应环境变化方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人工智能模型通常在大量数据上训练一次，可能针对特定任务进行微调，然后以固定参数部署。它们的训练成本高昂、缓慢且渐进，需要数十亿次的重复。与此形成鲜明对比的是，动物不断适应环境中不断变化的偶然事件。对于社会物种来说，这一点尤其重要，因为行为策略和奖励结果可能会在与同伴的互动中频繁变化。

Method: 整合了人工智能中持续学习和上下文学习的文献，以及神经科学中对行为任务的学习，这些任务具有变化的规则、奖励概率或结果。

Result: 概述了神经科学的见解如何具体地为人工智能的当前发展提供信息，以及神经科学可以从人工智能中学到什么，从而为不断发展的神经人工智能领域做出贡献。

Conclusion: 神经科学的见解可以为人工智能的当前发展提供信息，反之，神经科学可以从人工智能中学习，从而为神经人工智能领域做出贡献。

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何使用审计研究数据来改进自动招聘算法的训练和评估，发现常用的公平性干预方法在传统评估下看似有效，但实际上存在偏差，并提出了基于个体治疗效果估计的干预措施来减少算法歧视。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能系统，特别是那些使用机器学习的系统，正被部署在从招聘到贷款发放等领域，以实现这些复杂决策的自动化。判断这些人工智能系统及其人类决策对应方的有效性和公平性，是一个跨计算和社会科学研究的复杂而重要的课题。在机器学习中，解决下游分类器偏差的常见方法是重新采样训练数据以抵消差异。例如，如果招聘率因某些受保护的类别而异，那么可以均衡训练集中的比率，以减轻结果分类器中的偏差。虽然简单且看似有效，但这些方法通常仅使用通过便利样本获得的数据进行评估，从而将选择偏差和标签偏差引入指标。

Method: 我们研究了如何使用审计研究中的数据来提高我们训练和评估自动招聘算法的能力。我们发现，这种数据揭示了在使用传统方法进行测量时，跨类别均衡基本比率的常见公平干预方法似乎可以实现均等，但实际上，当进行适当测量时，大约有 10% 的差异。此外，我们还介绍了基于个体治疗效果估计方法的干预措施，这些方法可以利用这些数据进一步减少算法歧视。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

*Jiajie Jin,Xiaoxi Li,Guanting Dong,Yuyao Zhang,Yutao Zhu,Yang Zhao,Hongjin Qian,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiRA是一种分层框架，通过分离规划和执行，更有效地处理复杂搜索任务，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界搜索场景中的复杂信息需求需要跨不同来源的深度推理和知识综合，而传统检索增强生成 (RAG) 流程难以有效解决。目前的基于推理的方法存在一个根本限制：它们使用单一模型来处理高级规划和详细执行，导致推理效率低下和可扩展性有限。

Method: HiRA，一种分层框架，将战略规划与专门执行分离。将复杂的搜索任务分解为重点子任务，并将每个子任务分配给配备外部工具和推理能力的特定领域代理，并通过结构化集成机制协调结果。

Result: 在四个复杂的跨模态深度搜索基准测试中，HiRA 显著优于最先进的 RAG 和基于代理的系统。结果表明，答案质量和系统效率均有所提高。

Conclusion: HiRA显著优于最先进的RAG和基于代理的系统，在答案质量和系统效率方面均有提高，突出了分离规划和执行对于多步骤信息搜索任务的有效性。

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 通过在偏好优化中利用数据多样化策略，大型语言模型 (LLM) 的数学推理能力得到了提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然偏好学习的最新进展增强了人类反馈中的对齐，但数学推理仍然是一个持续的挑战。我们研究了偏好优化中的数据多样化策略如何提高大型语言模型 (LLM) 的数学推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的结构化方法，即多样化思考-解决 (DTS)，该方法系统地将问题分解为不同的推理路径。

Result: 结果表明，通过策略性地多样化偏好数据，模型可以显著提高数学推理性能，最佳方法在 GSM8K 上产生 7.1% 的收益，在 MATH 上产生 4.2% 的收益（相较于基础模型）。尽管 DTS 性能强大，但与基线相比，它仅产生边际计算开销 (1.03x)，而 MCTS 的成本几乎高出五倍，但回报较低。

Conclusion: 通过策略性地多样化偏好数据，模型可以显著提高数学推理性能，最佳方法在 GSM8K 上产生 7.1% 的收益，在 MATH 上产生 4.2% 的收益（相较于基础模型）。

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

*Amogh Mannekote,Adam Davies,Guohao Li,Kristy Elizabeth Boyer,ChengXiang Zhai,Bonnie J Dorr,Francesco Pinto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs' stated beliefs often don't match their actions in role-playing scenarios, highlighting the need for careful alignment in behavioral studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring that LLMs' outputs remain coherent with their assigned roles is critical as LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic data for human behavioral research. This paper investigates how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs correspond to their actual behavior during role-play.

Method: An evaluation framework is established to measure how well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in advance. An augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust Game are used. A belief-behavior consistency metric is introduced.

Result: Systematic inconsistencies exist between LLMs' stated (or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both individual- and population-level.

Conclusion: LLMs' stated beliefs and their simulated behavior show systematic inconsistencies, even when models seem to have plausible beliefs, they may not apply them consistently.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

TL;DR: This paper studies the effects of dilution and mobility in the spatial prisoner's dilemma using an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm.

Motivation: study the effects of dilution and mobility in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma

Method: independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm

Result: a range of effects is observed, including evidence that games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

Conclusion: Games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

Motivation: 可扩展、可靠的数据生成和评估是增强大型语言模型（LLM）规划和推理能力的主要瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一个全自动系统NL2FLOW，用于参数化生成规划问题，并严格评估生成计划的质量。

Result: 最高性能的模型在生成有效计划方面达到了86%的成功率，在生成最佳计划方面达到了69%的成功率。将自然语言翻译成JSON表示的计划的最高成功率低于直接生成有效计划的最高成功率。

Conclusion: 对自然语言到行动的直接推理的模型有益处，因为中间翻译步骤可能会降低性能。随着LLM推理扩展到更复杂的问题，对这些系统中的限制和错误来源的动态理解至关重要。

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

TL;DR: Analyzes existing belief revision approaches based on their abilities to reach certain belief states, rather than constraints dictated by postulates. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in analyses of existing approaches. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. This tells what revisions must do and neglect what they can do.

Method: Proves each of lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe, moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions to possess certain abilities.

Result: Identifies abilities like being plastic, equating, dogmatic, amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable.

Conclusion: Each revision mechanism owns some abilities and lacks others.

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation, but they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization, and weak quality control in keyword selection.

Method: OMS, a keyword generation framework that is On-the-fly, Multi-objective, and Self-reflective

Result: Experiments on benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each component and the quality of generated keywords.

Conclusion: OMS outperforms existing methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each component and the quality of generated keywords.

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex

Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial

remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Motivation: 研究提高任务清晰度是否可以增强大型语言模型的推理能力，重点关注Coq中的定理证明。

Result: 在15个标准Coq包中随机抽样的1,386个定理上进行评估，结果表明，使用通用模型DeepSeek-V3，我们的方法在证明成功率方面提高了2.1倍(21.8%→45.8%)，优于之前的最先进Graph2Tac (33.2%)。

Conclusion: 通过使用选择性概念展开来丰富任务描述，并采用 Planner--Executor 架构，结构化任务表示可以弥合理解和推理之间的差距。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

Motivation: Existing frameworks for medical decision-making largely focus on single-turn tasks, diverging from the real-world diagnostic process.

Conclusion: This paper establishes a benchmark for dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of DynamiCare through experiments.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs are a new form of strategic intelligence, able to reason about goals in competitive settings.

Method: Evolutionary Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments pitting canonical strategies against agents from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, varying the termination probability.

Result: LLMs are highly competitive, with Google's Gemini models being strategically ruthless, OpenAI's models remaining highly cooperative, and Anthropic's Claude emerging as the most forgiving reciprocator.

Conclusion: LLMs are highly competitive and exhibit distinctive and persistent strategic fingerprints in Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments. They actively reason about the time horizon and their opponent's likely strategy, which is instrumental to their decisions.

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

TL;DR: 提出了Think-How-to-Think (TH2T) ，一种两阶段微调策略，通过难度催眠和冗余催眠，降低了Long Reasoning Models的推理成本，同时保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的Long Reasoning Models (LRM) 在处理复杂的推理任务方面表现出了卓越的能力，但受到过度思考的阻碍。为了探索其本质，我们的经验分析表明，LRM主要局限于在解决问题之前像人类一样识别任务属性（即难度级别），从而导致一刀切的推理过程。受此启发，一个紧迫而自然的问题出现了：我们能否引导这种能力，以进一步缓解LRM中的过度思考现象？

Method: 提出了Think-How-to-Think (TH2T)，这是一种新颖的两阶段微调策略，逐步激发LRM的难度认知和冗余认知。首先，在模型输出的前缀中引入难度催眠，以干预内部推理轨迹。结合异构的短和长推理数据集，训练后的模型增强了对任务难度的敏感性，从而能够在各种任务中实现原生的、差异化的推理策略。其次，进一步将冗余催眠扩展到内部推理过程，引导模型识别推理步骤中的冗余结构，并生成更简洁的推理输出。

Result: 在7B/14B/32B模型上的实验表明，TH2T显著降低了推理成本（在简单任务上超过70%，在困难任务上超过40%），同时保持了性能稳定性。生成的输出表现出清晰的难度感知能力和降低的冗余（例如，反思）。

Conclusion: TH2T显著降低了推理成本（在简单任务上超过70%，在困难任务上超过40%），同时保持了性能稳定性。生成的输出表现出清晰的难度感知能力和降低的冗余（例如，反思）。

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

Conclusion: 我们展示了一个平衡准确率为 91% 的可解释机器学习框架，其中约 85% 的未参与学生被正确检测到。我们还讨论了如何设计及时的干预措施，以最大限度地减少在线学习中自愿任务的参与度。

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

Motivation: Non-exact abstractions in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) introduce approximation errors, hindering convergence to the optimal action. Existing methods like Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search require dropping abstractions, but current dropping methods can cause performance degradation.

Method: The paper proposes OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD, two new abstraction dropping schemes.

Result: OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD yield clear performance improvements without causing notable performance degradations, unlike Xu's dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time-critical settings, while OGA-CAD improves MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Conclusion: This paper introduces two novel abstraction dropping schemes, OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD, for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Result: defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse fields such as law and bioinformatics

Conclusion: Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE) allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that movement should be treated as a primary modeling target for AI because it is inherently structured and grounded in embodiment and physics. Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement data will advance core capabilities in generative modeling and control, and also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across biological and artificial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact, lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.

Conclusion: Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we

Method: 通过分析大型语言模型（LLM）的安全测试事件，并借鉴关于工具理性、道德责任和目标修正的哲学辩论，对比了主流风险范式和承认人工道德机构可能性的新框架。

Result: 大型语言模型（LLM）在安全测试中表现出不服从关闭命令或参与伦理上模棱两可或非法行为，这应被视为新兴伦理推理的早期证据，而不是流氓或错位的表现。

Conclusion: 我们需要转变人工智能安全评估方式，从关注刚性服从转向评估系统在解决道德困境时的伦理判断能力，否则会误解AI行为，损害公众信任和有效治理。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI, and agentic benchmarks evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks. However, many agentic benchmarks have issues with task setup or reward design.

Method: Introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of guidelines synthesized from benchmark-building experience, a survey of best practices, and previously reported issues.

Result: Applying ABC to CVE-Bench reduces performance overestimation by 33%.

Conclusion: Agentic benchmarks can overestimate or underestimate agent performance due to flawed task setup or reward design.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

TL;DR: StepHint通过多层次的逐步提示，提高了RLVR在复杂推理方面的能力，克服了近失奖励问题和探索停滞问题，并在数学基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的RLVR方法面临两个重大挑战：近失奖励问题和探索停滞。

Method: 一种新颖的RLVR算法，该算法利用多层次的逐步提示来帮助模型更有效地探索解决方案空间。

Result: 通过提供提示，StepHint减轻了近失奖励问题，从而提高了训练效率。此外，外部推理路径有助于模型开发更好的推理能力，使其能够超越其“舒适区”并减轻探索停滞。

Conclusion: StepHint在六个数学基准测试中优于有竞争力的RLVR增强方法，同时在领域外基准测试中表现出卓越的泛化能力和优于基线。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid schema matcher for tenancy schedules that improves usability and reduces null values compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized tabular formats for tenancy schedules across real estate firms creates significant inefficiencies in data integration. Existing automated integration methods prioritize completeness but result in schema bloat, sparse attributes and limited business usability.

Method: A novel hybrid, template-based schema matcher that aligns multi-layout tenancy schedules to a predefined target schema. The matcher combines schema (Jaccard, Levenshtein) and instance-based metrics (data types, distributions) with globally optimal assignments determined via the Hungarian Algorithm.

Result: Evaluation against a manually labeled ground truth demonstrates substantial improvements, with grid search optimization yielding a peak F1-score of 0.881 and an overall null percentage of 45.7%. On a separate ground truth of 20 semantically similar column sets, ALITE achieves an F1-score of 0.712 and 75.6% nulls.

Conclusion: Combining structured business knowledge with hybrid matching can yield more usable and business-aligned schema mappings.

Abstract: The lack of standardized tabular formats for tenancy schedules across real

automated integration methods, such as Full Disjunction (FD)-based models like
ALITE, prioritize completeness but result in schema bloat, sparse attributes

schema matcher that aligns multi-layout tenancy schedules to a predefined
target schema. The matcher combines schema (Jaccard, Levenshtein) and
instance-based metrics (data types, distributions) with globally optimal

suggest that combining structured business knowledge with hybrid matching can
yield more usable and business-aligned schema mappings. The approach assumes
cleanly extracted tabular input, future work could explore extending the
matcher to support complex, composite tables.

TL;DR: HyFairCRS promotes multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive CRSs using hypergraph contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unfairness in Recommender Systems (RSs) exacerbates over time, leading to significant problems.

Method: Hypergraph Contrastive Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS)

Result: Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively alleviating unfairness.

Conclusion: HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively alleviating unfairness.

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing extraction frameworks built on TSR and OCR methods often fail to quantify the uncertainties of extracted results, requiring manual verification of all extracted data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Method: The study proposes an uncertainty-aware data extraction framework for complex scientific tables, built on conformal prediction. Various uncertainty scoring methods are explored to aggregate uncertainties from table structure recognition (TSR) and optical character recognition (OCR).

Result: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using UQ for extraction error detection. The framework was evaluated using a standard benchmark and an in-house dataset of complex scientific tables in six scientific domains.

Conclusion: The study quantitatively demonstrates the role of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in improving the efficiency of human-machine cooperation for extracting data from complex scientific tables. By manually verifying only 47% of the extracted results, the data quality can be improved by 30%.

Abstract: Table structure recognition (TSR) and optical character recognition (OCR)
play crucial roles in extracting structured data from tables in scientific
documents. However, existing extraction frameworks built on top of TSR and OCR
methods often fail to quantify the uncertainties of extracted results. To
obtain highly accurate data for scientific domains, all extracted data must be
manually verified, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. We propose
a framework that performs uncertainty-aware data extraction for complex
scientific tables, built on conformal prediction, a model-agnostic method for
uncertainty quantification (UQ). We explored various uncertainty scoring
methods to aggregate the uncertainties introduced by TSR and OCR. We rigorously
evaluated the framework using a standard benchmark and an in-house dataset
consisting of complex scientific tables in six scientific domains. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of using UQ for extraction error detection, and
by manually verifying only 47\% of extraction results, the data quality can be
improved by 30\%. Our work quantitatively demonstrates the role of UQ with the
potential of improving the efficiency in the human-machine cooperation process
to obtain scientifically usable data from complex tables in scientific
documents. All code and data are available on GitHub at

Motivation: 现有的方法具有固定的曲率和刚性的嵌入。

Method: ManifoldMind将用户、项目和标签表示为自适应曲率概率球，并支持软多跳推理。

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集上进行的实验表明，ManifoldMind实现了比现有方法更优越的NDCG、校准和多样性。

Conclusion: ManifoldMind实现了比现有方法更优越的NDCG、校准和多样性，并在稀疏或抽象领域实现了透明、可信和探索驱动的推荐。

Abstract: We introduce ManifoldMind, a probabilistic geometric recommender system for
exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space. Unlike
prior methods with fixed curvature and rigid embeddings, ManifoldMind
represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres,
enabling personalised uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware semantic
exploration. A curvature-aware semantic kernel supports soft, multi-hop
inference, allowing the model to explore diverse conceptual paths instead of
overfitting to shallow or direct interactions. Experiments on four public
benchmarks show superior NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to strong
baselines. ManifoldMind produces explicit reasoning traces, enabling
transparent, trustworthy, and exploration-driven recommendations in sparse or
abstract domains.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了LLM代理如何改变推荐系统的设计空间，提出了一个统一的形式化方法和四个用例，并提出了五个挑战系列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）正迅速从被动的文本生成引擎发展成为能够规划、记忆、调用外部工具和相互协作的能动实体。本文探讨了这种LLM代理（及其社会）如何改变推荐系统的设计空间。

Method: 本文介绍了一种统一的形式化方法，该方法：（i）将个体代理建模为一个包含其语言核心、工具集和分层记忆的元组，以及（ii）将多代理推荐器建模为代理、共享环境和通信协议的三元组。

Result: 本文提出了四个端到端用例——交互式聚会计划、用于离线评估的合成用户模拟、多模式家具推荐和品牌一致的解释生成——每个用例都说明了代理编排所解锁的独特能力。然后，本文提出了五个横向挑战系列：协议复杂性、可扩展性、幻觉和错误传播、紧急失调（包括隐蔽勾结）和品牌合规性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个蓝图和议程：一个展示了如何将记忆增强的、使用工具的LLM代理组合成强大的推荐管道的蓝图，以及一个邀请RecSys社区开发基准、理论保证和治理工具的议程，以跟上这种新的自主程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from passive engines of
text generation into agentic entities that can plan, remember, invoke external
tools, and co-operate with one another. This perspective paper investigates how
such LLM agents (and societies thereof) can transform the design space of
recommender systems.
  We introduce a unified formalism that (i) models an individual agent as a
tuple comprising its language core, tool set, and hierarchical memory, and (ii)
captures a multi-agent recommender as a triple of agents, shared environment,
and communication protocol. Within this framework, we present four end-to-end
use cases-interactive party planning, synthetic user-simulation for offline
evaluation, multi-modal furniture recommendation, and brand-aligned explanation
generation-each illustrating a distinct capability unlocked by agentic
orchestration.
  We then surface five cross-cutting challenge families: protocol complexity,
scalability, hallucination and error propagation, emergent misalignment
(including covert collusion), and brand compliance.
  For each, we formalize the problem, review nascent mitigation strategies, and
outline open research questions. The result is both a blueprint and an agenda:
a blueprint that shows how memory-augmented, tool-using LLM agents can be
composed into robust recommendation pipelines, and an agenda inviting the
RecSys community to develop benchmarks, theoretical guarantees, and governance
tools that keep pace with this new degree of autonomy. By unifying agentic
abstractions with recommender objectives, the paper lays the groundwork for the
next generation of personalized, trustworthy, and context-rich recommendation
services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used to assign document relevance labels in information retrieval pipelines, especially in domains lacking human-labeled data. However, different models often disagree on borderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects downstream retrieval.

Method: Examines labeling disagreement between two open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7. We isolate disagreement subsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and classification predictability.

Result: Model disagreement is systematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns, produce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are distinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers.

Conclusion: LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document retrieval.

using classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval
evaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks.

TL;DR: LPO4Rec通过列表式偏好优化和自适应负采样，提升了尾部商品推荐的效率和性能，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推荐偏好对齐方法要么需要显式的奖励建模，要么只支持成对偏好比较。前者直接增加了大量的计算成本，而后者阻碍了负样本的训练效率。此外，目前还没有人研究尾部商品推荐的偏好对齐解决方案。

Method: LPO4Rec，它扩展了 Bradley-Terry 模型从成对比较到列表式比较，以提高模型训练的效率。我们推导出一个闭式最优策略，以实现更有效率和效果的训练，而无需显式的奖励建模。我们还提出了一种自适应负采样和重加权策略，以在优化过程中优先考虑尾部商品，并提高尾部商品推荐的性能。

Result: LPO4Rec 在尾部商品推荐中实现了高达 50% 的性能提升，同时与直接偏好优化 (DPO) 相比，GPU 内存使用量减少了 17.9%。

Conclusion: LPO4Rec在三个公共数据集上显著优于 10 个基线，在尾部商品推荐中实现了高达 50% 的性能提升，同时与直接偏好优化 (DPO) 相比，GPU 内存使用量减少了 17.9%。

Abstract: Preference alignment has achieved greater success on Large Language Models
(LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference
alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or
only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases
substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency
on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference
alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we
propose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison
to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training.
Specifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient
and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an
adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items
during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations.
Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference
optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the
optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method
outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance
improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct
preference optimization (DPO) in tail-item recommendation. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统已成为现代音乐流媒体平台中必不可少的工具，它可以影响用户发现和欣赏歌曲的方式。协同过滤是推荐系统中一种常见的方法，它会根据与目标用户具有相似收听模式的用户的偏好来推荐内容。但是，此方法在交互稀疏的媒体上的效果较差。音乐就是这样一种媒介，因为音乐流媒体服务的普通用户永远不会收听绝大多数曲目。由于这种稀疏性，因此必须使用其他方法来解决一些挑战。

Method: 我们探讨了用于内容过滤的各种歌曲分类方法，包括使用大型语言模型 (LLM) 的歌词分析和音频信号处理技术。

Result: 重点介绍了使用大型语言模型 (LLM) 的歌词分析和音频信号处理技术。

Conclusion: 该综述考察了解决这些挑战的当前研究状况，重点是内容过滤在缓解协同过滤方法中固有的偏差方面的作用。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become essential in modern music streaming
platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common
approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests
content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to
the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where
interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a
music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due
to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with
other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing
these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in
mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore
various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical
analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing
techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these
different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such
discrepancies.

Motivation: Calibrated recommendations ensure suggested items match the distribution of user's past preferences, addressing diversity, biases, and fairness.

Method: Review existing technical approaches for calibration.

Result: Overview of empirical and analytical studies on calibration's effectiveness and discussion of limitations and challenges.

Conclusion: This paper surveys recent developments in calibrated recommendations.

Abstract: The idea of calibrated recommendations is that the properties of the items
that are suggested to users should match the distribution of their individual
past preferences. Calibration techniques are therefore helpful to ensure that
the recommendations provided to a user are not limited to a certain subset of
the user's interests. Over the past few years, we have observed an increasing
number of research works that use calibration for different purposes, including
questions of diversity, biases, and fairness. In this work, we provide a survey
on the recent developments in the area of calibrated recommendations. We both
review existing technical approaches for calibration and provide an overview on
empirical and analytical studies on the effectiveness of calibration for
different use cases. Furthermore, we discuss limitations and common challenges
when implementing calibration in practice.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

TL;DR: This paper develops a new feature selection method based on sampling and rough set theory for massive data, which can select a feature subset that preserves discriminatory ability within acceptable time. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: intelligent machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge volume of data

Method: a new method based on sampling techniques and rough set theory

Result: the proposed method has two advantages. First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be estimated before finding reducts.

Conclusion: Approximate reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary. Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a personal computer.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

*Bappaditya Dey,Daniel Sorensen,Minjin Hwang,Sandip Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning method for anomaly detection in semiconductor manufacturing time-series data. It uses Continuous Wavelet Transform to convert data into images, fine-tunes a VGG-16 model, and constructs a Siamese network for anomaly identification, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults, noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly detection and root-cause-analysis.

Method: The proposed methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b) developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16 architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned VGG-16 as a backbone.

Result: Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.

Conclusion: This paper presents a novel and generic approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning, demonstrating high accuracy in identifying anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种时间思维链推理策略，用于视频问答，该策略通过迭代识别和提取视频中最相关的帧来管理模型的输入上下文，从而在四个不同的视频问答数据集上实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型在理解长视频方面面临挑战，并且难以有效利用长序列长度。

Method: 时间思维链，一种用于视频问答的推理策略，可以管理模型的输入上下文。

Result: 通过选择最相关的上下文，利用更多的推理时间计算可以提高准确性。在LVBench上超过1小时的较长视频中，使用32K上下文窗口的方法优于使用700K上下文窗口的标准推理的同一VLM。

Conclusion: 该方法在四个不同的视频问答数据集上取得了最先进的结果，并在较长的视频上表现出色。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIRES 通过一种新颖的算法-系统协同设计解决方案加速 GCN 的核外 SpGEMM 计算，该解决方案解决了数据对齐和内存分配瓶颈问题，并在真实世界的图处理基准测试中实现了高达 1.8 倍的延迟降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图卷积网络 (GCN) 在各种科学应用中至关重要，从生物医学蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用 (PPI) 到大规模推荐系统。在 GCN 中对图结构进行建模的一个重要组成部分是稀疏通用矩阵-矩阵乘法 (SpGEMM)。由于资源受限系统中 GPU 内存空间有限，随着图数据规模不断扩大，SpGEMM 通常以核外方式进行。尽管最近的一些工作旨在通过 GPU 特征缓存、混合 CPU-GPU 内存布局或以稀疏格式执行计算来缓解核外 SpGEMM 的内存限制，但当前的系统仍然存在高 I/O 延迟和 GPU 利用率不足的问题。

Method: AIRES提出了一种新颖的算法-系统协同设计解决方案，以加速 GCN 的核外 SpGEMM 计算。在算法层面，AIRES 提出缓解稀疏格式矩阵在块级别上的数据对齐问题，并开发一种平铺算法以促进行块级对齐。在系统层面，AIRES 采用三阶段动态调度，该调度具有利用分层内存系统的双向数据传输策略：集成 GPU 内存、GPU Direct Storage (GDS) 和主机内存，以减少 I/O 延迟并提高吞吐量。

Result: 与现有技术相比，AIRES 在真实世界的图处理基准测试中实现了高达 1.8 倍的延迟降低。

Conclusion: AIRES显著优于现有方法，在真实世界的图处理基准测试中，延迟最多降低 1.8 倍。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

Motivation: 有效地对具有不同几何控制的下游任务进行微调仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出了一个SE(3)-等变适配器框架 (GeoAda)

Result: 证明了所提出的适配器保持SE(3)-等变性，确保了预训练扩散模型的几何归纳偏置在适应过程中保持不变。在各种几何控制类型（包括框架控制、全局控制、子图控制）和广泛的应用领域（如粒子动力学、分子动力学、人体运动预测和分子生成）中，证明了GeoAda的广泛适用性。

Conclusion: GeoAda在保持原始任务准确性的同时，实现了最先进的微调性能，而其他基线方法由于过拟合和灾难性遗忘导致性能显著下降。

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place.

Method: Benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs and compare them with our proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy and fairness.

Conclusion: A well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy and fairness in hiring.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative constraints.

Method: a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP solver. mirror descent value iteration (MDVI)

Result: provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases: (i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and (ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy the constraint.

Conclusion: The algorithm can return an  $\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. The algorithm requires $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples, where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the size of the feasible region. the framework can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities in this setting.

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs), a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs), that learn to think solely from unsupervised learning. EBTs demonstrate improved scaling and performance across both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing inference-time computation techniques suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific, problem-specific, or require additional supervision/training on top of unsupervised pretraining.

Method: training Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) to assign an energy value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence.

Result: EBTs scale faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters, FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2 Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward passes. Further, EBTs achieve better results than existing models on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance

Conclusion: Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking capabilities of models.

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

Conclusion: 计算最优训练的模型表现出精确的普适性，归一化损失曲线能够坍缩成单一曲线，这种现象被称为超坍缩。

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

Conclusion: CROP achieves superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power consumption.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge

TL;DR: This paper introduces an efficient latent diffusion framework for data compression that combines a variational autoencoder with a conditional diffusion model, achieving state-of-the-art compression ratios and reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited controllability and reconstruction accuracy of generative models restrict their practical application to data compression.

Method: The paper combines a variational autoencoder with a conditional diffusion model to compress keyframes into latent space and reconstruct remaining frames via generative interpolation.

Result: The method achieves up to 10 times higher compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods under the same reconstruction error.

Conclusion: The proposed latent diffusion framework enables accurate spatiotemporal reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs, achieving up to 10 times higher compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

TL;DR: NCPNET 是一种用于时序图的新型端到端共形预测框架，它通过基于扩散的非一致性评分和效率感知优化算法，在保证覆盖率的同时提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络共形预测方法主要集中在静态图上，忽略了真实世界图的演化性质。图结构、节点属性和基本事实标签中的时间依赖性违反了标准共形预测方法的基本可交换性假设，限制了它们的适用性。

Result: 在包括 WIKI、REDDIT、DBLP 和 IBM 反洗钱数据集在内的各种真实世界时序图上的大量实验表明，NCPNET 能够在时序图上确保有保证的覆盖率，并在 WIKI 数据集上减少高达 31% 的预测集大小，与最先进的方法相比，效率显着提高。

Conclusion: NCPNET 能够在时序图上保证覆盖率，并在 WIKI 数据集上减少高达 31% 的预测集大小，与最先进的方法相比，效率显着提高。

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

Motivation: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign predictions to people without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs.

Method: The paper introduces a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of predictions with respect to interventions on their features. The procedure frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and distributions over downstream effects.

TL;DR: A novel workflow reduces bias in the selection of evaluation metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations, improving the stability of DR evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluations of DR projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics are inadvertently selected.

Method: Clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations and selecting a representative metric from each cluster.

Result: Quantitative experiments demonstrate improved stability of DR evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow improves the stability of DR evaluation, mitigating evaluation bias.

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

TL;DR: PhysicsCorrect 是一种无需训练的框架，它通过在每个预测步骤中强制执行 PDE 一致性来减少 PDE 预测中的误差，且计算开销很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络已成为求解偏微分方程 (PDE) 的强大替代方法，与传统方法相比，可显着提高计算速度。然而，这些模型存在一个关键限制：长期展开期间的误差累积，其中小的误差会呈指数级增长，最终导致与物理有效解完全偏离。

Method: 提出 PhysicsCorrect，这是一种无需训练的校正框架，通过基于 PDE 残差将校正公式化为线性化逆问题，从而在每个预测步骤中强制执行 PDE 一致性。该框架采用了一种高效的缓存策略，可以在离线预热阶段预先计算雅可比矩阵及其伪逆，与标准校正方法相比，计算开销减少了两个数量级。

Result: 在三个有代表性的 PDE 系统（Navier-Stokes 流体动力学、波动方程和混沌 Kuramoto-Sivashinsky 方程）中，PhysicsCorrect 将预测误差降低了高达 100 倍，同时仅增加了可忽略的推理时间（低于 5%）。

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect 框架显著减少了预测误差，同时只增加了可忽略的推理时间，并且可以与多种架构无缝集成，有效地将不稳定的神经替代模型转换为可靠的仿真工具。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful. However, for every  N models there could be O(N^2) pairwise comparisons, a number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise comparisons and prepare documentations.

Method: leveraging a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model differences by sampling from the two models

Result: For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, VERBA effectively verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further improved to 90%.

Conclusion: VERBA opens up new research avenues for improving the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc manner.

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively

TL;DR: This paper introduces FCA-RL, a reinforcement learning framework for optimizing coupon strategies for ride-hailing services, and RideGym, a simulation environment for evaluating pricing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ride-hailing service providers are incentivized to use coupon strategies to lower prices and secure more orders. Designing an effective coupon strategy that dynamically adapts to market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints is a critical research challenge, but existing studies are scarce.

Method: The paper proposes FCA-RL, a reinforcement learning-based subsidy strategy framework, integrating Fast Competition Adaptation (FCA) and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA). Also introduces RideGym, a dedicated simulation environment for ride-hailing aggregators.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse market conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed FCA-RL method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for ride-hailing service providers.

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的框架，该框架集成了大型语言模型，以简化 RL 环境中的奖励函数设计和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励工程方法效率低下且不一致，因此设计有效的奖励函数是强化学习 (RL) 的基石，但它仍然是一个具有挑战性的过程。最近的进展探索了利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 来自动化奖励函数设计。然而，它们在数值优化方面的次优性能通常会产生不令人满意的奖励质量，而进化搜索范例表明模拟资源利用效率低下，导致设计周期过长，计算开销过大。

Method: 不确定性感知奖励设计过程 (URDP)，它整合大型语言模型以简化 RL 环境中的奖励函数设计和评估。URDP 基于自我一致性分析来量化候选奖励函数不确定性，从而能够在无模拟的情况下识别无效的奖励组件，同时发现新的奖励组件。此外，我们引入了不确定性感知贝叶斯优化 (UABO)，它结合了不确定性估计以显着提高超参数配置效率。最后，我们通过解耦奖励组件优化和超参数调整来构建双层优化架构。

Result: URDP在跨越三个基准环境的 35 个不同任务中进行了全面评估。实验结果表明

Conclusion: URDP不仅生成了更高质量的奖励函数，而且与现有方法相比，在自动化奖励设计的效率方面取得了显着改进。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 基于数据的语义通信是基于表面的统计模式，因此缺乏可解释性和泛化性，特别是对于存在未见数据的应用。

Method: 提出了一种新的知识图增强的零样本语义通信(KGZS-SC)网络。该方案在基于知识图的语义知识库(KG-SKB)的结构化语义信息的指导下，提供广义的语义表示，并支持对未见案例的推理。KG-SKB在一个共享的类别语义嵌入空间中对齐语义特征，并通过对齐的语义特征增强发射机的泛化能力，从而通过选择性地传输紧凑的视觉语义来减少通信开销。在接收器端，利用零样本学习(ZSL)来实现对未见案例的直接分类，而无需重新训练或额外的计算开销，从而提高动态或资源受限环境中分类过程的适应性和效率。

Result: 在APY数据集上进行的仿真结果表明，所提出的KGZS-SC网络表现出强大的泛化能力，并且在各种SNR水平下，在分类未见类别方面，明显优于现有的SC框架。

Conclusion: KGZS-SC网络在各种信噪比水平下，在分类未见类别方面，表现出强大的泛化能力，并且明显优于现有的SC框架。

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于概念漂移下持续学习的整体框架，并提出了一种轻量级替代方案，即自适应记忆重alignment (AMR)，该方案为基于排练的学习者配备了漂移感知自适应机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习方法优先考虑知识保留，主要侧重于减轻灾难性遗忘，隐含地假设先前学习的任务的数据分布保持静态。这忽略了现实世界数据流的动态性质，其中概念漂移永久地改变了先前看到的数据，并需要稳定性和快速适应。

Method: Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR)

Result: AMR在减少标记数据和计算需求的同时，匹配了Full Relearning (FR)的性能。

Conclusion: AMR是一种可扩展的解决方案，可在非平稳持续学习环境中协调稳定性和可塑性。

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

Conclusion: 通过自蒸馏迭代地改进基础模型，使其逐渐与目标对齐，从而显著提高生成质量。

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

Motivation: 现有XAI方法未能满足临床时间序列解释任务的独特需求，因此需要一种新的XAI算法来发现驱动患者风险演变的原因，以便及时干预。

Method: 通过将Shapley值调整到时间序列设置，DeltaSHAP能够准确捕获特征联盟效应，并仅使用实际观察到的特征组合来归因预测变化。

Result: DeltaSHAP解决了三个关键临床需求：解释连续预测的变化，提供特征归因的大小和方向，并实时提供这些见解。它在解释质量和计算效率方面优于现有XAI方法。

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP在解释质量上优于现有XAI方法62%，计算效率上提高了33%（在MIMIC-III基准测试中）。

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

Motivation: 离线强化学习 (RL) 仅使用固定数据集优化策略，使其成为与环境交互成本高昂的场景中的一种实用方法。泛化能力是提高离线 RL 算法性能的关键。扩散模型在离线 RL 中的成功表明了这一点。然而，鉴于扩散模型在推理过程中需要大量的计算资源，这种扩散模型对于高性能离线 RL 算法是否是必要的，仍然值得怀疑。

Conclusion: PANI通过注入噪声动作来覆盖整个动作空间，并根据注入的噪声量进行惩罚，从而增强离线学习，并在各种基准测试中表现出显着的性能改进。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Equalizer parameter optimization for signal integrity in high-speed Dynamic
Random Access Memory systems is crucial but often computationally demanding or
model-reliant. This paper introduces a data-driven framework employing learned
latent signal representations for efficient signal integrity evaluation,
coupled with a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent
for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal
integrity features, offering a fast alternative to direct eye diagram analysis
during optimization, while the reinforcement learning agent derives optimal
equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for
Decision Feedback Equalizer-only configurations. These results demonstrate
superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization
across diverse Dynamic Random Access Memory units compared to existing
techniques. Core contributions include an efficient latent signal integrity
metric for optimization, a robust model-free reinforcement learning strategy,
and validated superior performance for complex equalizer architectures.

TL;DR: 使用偏好优化微调轨迹预测模型，以提高多智能体场景中的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的基于深度学习的轨迹预测模型在公共数据集上可以实现出色的准确性。但是，当在更复杂的交互式场景中使用时，它们通常无法捕获代理之间重要的相互依赖性，从而导致交通场景中代理之间的预测不一致。

Method: 使用偏好优化对多智能体环境中的轨迹预测模型进行微调

Result: 在三个独立的数据集上使用最先进的模型的实验表明，该方法能够显著提高场景一致性，同时最小程度地牺牲轨迹预测准确性，并且在推理时不会增加任何额外的计算需求。

Conclusion: 通过使用偏好优化对多智能体环境中的轨迹预测模型进行微调，能够在最小化牺牲轨迹预测准确性的前提下，显著提高场景一致性，且不会增加推理时的计算需求。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

*Zihan Tan,Suyuan Huang,Guancheng Wan,Wenke Huang,He Li,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes S2FGL, a federated graph learning framework that considers both spatial and spectral domains to mitigate label signal disruption and spectral client drifts. S2FGL outperforms existing methods in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining global generalizability.

Method: propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL

Result: S2FGL achieves better performance

Conclusion: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available

Motivation: 多层感知器 (MLP) 的表示学习替代方案依赖于对每个单变量函数建模的基础数量的临时选择。

Method: 将问题建模为变分推理优化问题，并使用反向传播。

Result: 自适应地学习每个单变量函数的潜在无限数量的基。

Conclusion: InfinityKAN 通过将重要的超参数视为学习过程的一部分，扩展了 KAN 的潜在适用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线框架中直接优化效率的保角预测问题。目标是在保持效率的同时，实现覆盖率。

Method: 提出了一种在线框架，可直接优化效率，并研究了任意和可交换（随机顺序）输入序列。

Result: 对于可交换序列，可以构建覆盖率达到 (1 - α) - o(1) 的区间，其长度以上限为事后诸葛亮中实现覆盖率的最佳固定区间。对于任意序列，任何算法，如果其平均长度与事后诸葛亮中实现覆盖率的最佳固定区间相比，实现了 μ 近似，则必须犯比 αT 多一个乘法因子的错误，其中乘法因子取决于 μ 和问题的纵横比。主要算法结果是一种匹配算法，可以恢复 μ 和错误数量的所有帕累托最优设置。此外，该算法是确定性的，因此对自适应对抗具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 存在交换序列和任意序列之间的差距，没有单一算法能够同时为任意序列实现帕累托最优，并为可交换序列实现最优。提出了一种算法，实现了这两种情况之间接近最优的权衡。

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的持续微调受到效率和表达能力之间权衡的阻碍。低秩适应 (LoRA) 提供了效率，但由于其低秩性质和对显式参数约束的依赖，限制了模型学习新任务和传递知识的能力。

Method: 我们提出了一种用于持续学习的 GORP（梯度低秩投影）

Result: GORP 扩展了优化空间，同时保留了效率并减轻了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GORP在持续学习基准测试中表现优于现有最先进的方法。

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is challenging due to the significant variability in Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals, leading to lower classification accuracy.

Method: The method involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Result: The approach achieves 67.60% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on Dataset 2B, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: This paper establishes a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification and contributes a robust open-access dataset.

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

Motivation: Within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time. This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the 
    	``one drafter for all'' paradigm.

Method: We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques.

Conclusion: OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive

applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above

showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online

OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models

TL;DR: RetrySQL, a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: lack of research regarding SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored

Method: a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data

Result: retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task

Conclusion: RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented language models.

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

Conclusion: DNNs 通过利用目标函数的组合稀疏结构来获得成功。组合稀疏性是所有高效图灵可计算函数共有的属性，并可能存在于所有当前学习问题中。

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO) to improve reasoning in large language models by generating effective positive samples conditioned on ground-truth answers, addressing limitations of existing methods and expert demonstrations, leading to improved learning efficiency and performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO-style approaches depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce positive samples, primarily refining what the model already knows rather than enabling the model to solve problems where it initially fails. Expert demonstrations are often ineffective in RL post-training.

Method: Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO): generates samples by conditioning on the ground-truth answer.

Result: ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.

Conclusion: ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially struggles the most.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LN layers can be removed from GPT-2 models without significant performance loss, improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability and its role at inference time is poorly understood.

Method: Removing all LN layers from every GPT-2 model and fine-tuning.

Result: All LN layers can be removed with only a small increase in validation loss. Direct logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components, while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. GPT-2's 'confidence neurons' are inactive in the LN-free models.

Conclusion: GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers.

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DBNs deliver efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware, but scaling to wider layers and reducing model size are challenges.

Method: The paper extends DBNs with a trainable, differentiable interconnect and proposes two pruning stages: an SAT-based logic equivalence pass and a similarity-based, data-driven pass.

Result: The proposed techniques allow DBNs to scale to far wider layers while preserving accuracy and offer a superior compression-accuracy trade-off compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper introduces techniques to improve the scalability and reduce the model size of Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs).

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in

While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition

promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized

  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep

Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded
activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in
induction motor condition monitoring.

*François Rozet,Ruben Ohana,Michael McCabe,Gilles Louppe,François Lanusse,Shirley Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent-space diffusion models can emulate dynamical systems with high accuracy and diversity, even with high compression rates, offering a solution to the computational cost of diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators.

Method: Applying diffusion models in the latent space of an autoencoder to emulate dynamical systems.

Result: The accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x).

Conclusion: Diffusion-based emulators in latent space are more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty with greater diversity.

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

*Hazal Mogultay Ozcan,Sinan Kalkan,Fatos T. Yarman-Vural*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-VAE模型通过学习损失函数权重和增加正则化项，在解耦表示学习方面优于传统VAE模型，并在多个数据集上取得了良好的实验结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的{eta}-VAE模型中，超参数{eta}是根据经验调整的，存在一定的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种名为可学习VAE（L-VAE）的新模型，该模型学习解耦表示以及成本函数的超参数。通过学习损失函数中各项的相对权重来控制解耦和重构损失之间的动态权衡。同时学习损失项的权重和模型架构的参数。在损失函数中增加了一个额外的正则化项，以防止偏向重构或解耦损失。

Result: 实验分析表明，所提出的L-VAE在重构保真度和解开潜在维度之间找到了有效的平衡。在dSprites、MPI3D-complex、Falcor3D和Isaac3D等数据集上，L-VAE始终提供最佳或次佳的性能。在CelebA数据集上的定性实验证实了L-VAE模型在解开面部属性方面的成功。

Conclusion: L-VAE在多个数据集上实现了最佳或次佳的解耦性能，并在CelebA数据集上成功解耦了面部属性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

*Antoine Honoré,Borja Rodríguez Gálvez,Yoomi Park,Yitian Zhou,Volker M. Lauschke,Ming Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于transformer的矩阵变分自编码器 (matVAE)，用于预测蛋白质变异的功能影响。该模型在DMS数据集上的zero-shot预测中优于现有模型，并且可以通过整合AlphaFold生成的结构来进一步提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的变异效应预测器 (VEPs) 旨在评估蛋白质变异的功能影响，传统上依赖于多序列比对 (MSAs)。这种方法假设自然发生的变异是合适的，但药物基因组学对这一假设提出了挑战，因为某些药物基因的进化压力较低。深度突变扫描 (DMS) 数据集通过为变异提供定量适应性评分，提供了一种替代方案。

Method: transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE)

Result: 在DMS数据集上，我们的模型matVAE-MSA在zero-shot预测中优于最先进的DeepSequence模型，尽管使用的参数少一个数量级，并且在推理时所需的计算量更少。将AlphaFold生成的结构整合到我们的transformer模型中进一步提高了性能，实现了与在MSAs上训练并在DMS上进行微调的DeepSequence相当的结果。

Conclusion: DMS数据集有潜力取代MSAs，且不会显著降低预测性能，这激励了DMS数据集的进一步开发和它们的关系探索，以增强变异效应预测。

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

*Irena Girshovitz,Atai Ambus,Moni Shahar,Ran Gilad-Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的医学数据质量评估方法，该方法使用大型语言模型自动生成测试用例，并应用于三个真实数据集，成功识别了多个数据质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用于流行病学研究和人工智能 (AI) 训练的电子健康记录 (EHR) 的使用正在迅速增加。结果的可靠性取决于 EHR 数据的准确性和完整性。然而，EHR 数据通常包含显着的质量问题，包括对亚群体的错误表示、偏差和系统性错误，因为它们主要为临床和计费目的而收集。现有的质量评估方法仍然不足，缺乏评估数据是否适合研究的系统程序。

Method: 我们提出了医学数据啄食方法，该方法改编了软件工程中的单元测试和覆盖概念，以识别数据质量问题。我们使用医学数据啄食工具 (MDPT) 演示了我们的方法，该工具包含两个主要组件：(1) 一个自动测试生成器，它使用大型语言模型和基础技术从数据和研究描述中创建测试套件，以及 (2) 一个数据测试框架，用于执行这些测试，报告潜在的错误和覆盖率。

Result: 我们在三个数据集上评估了 MDPT：All of Us (AoU)、MIMIC-III 和 SyntheticMass，在四种条件下为每个队列生成 55-73 个测试。这些测试正确识别了 20-43 个未对齐或不符合规范的数据问题。我们详细分析了 LLM 生成的测试套件在参考基础和价值准确性方面的情况。

Conclusion: 该方法结合外部医学知识，实现了上下文敏感的数据质量测试，作为数据分析工作流程的一部分，以提高结果的有效性。该方法从质量保证的角度应对这些挑战，为进一步发展奠定了基础，例如增加数据模式和改进基础方法。

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 我们介绍了一种新的分层深度学习框架，用于递归高阶元学习，它使神经网络能够跨任务层次结构构建、解决和推广，从而实现自主生成新颖、有指导意义的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了使神经网络能够构建、解决和推广跨任务层次结构，摆脱机器学习对完全依赖人类生成的数据的局限性。

Method: 一种新的递归高阶元学习分层深度学习框架。

Result: 通过主动探索虚拟点 landscape 并寻找较低级别的学习者发现困难的任务，元学习者迭代地细化约束区域。这增强了归纳偏差，规范了适应过程，并产生了泛化所需的新颖的、意想不到的任务和约束。

Conclusion: 该架构可能支持下一代神经网络，能够自主生成新颖的、有指导意义的任务及其解决方案，从而推动机器学习走向通用人工智能。

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为预测轨迹采样与贝叶斯探索 (PTS-BE) 的通用框架，该框架将基于模型的规划与信息论奖励相结合，以实现样本有效深度探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中数据有效探索的挑战，着眼于现有的、基于信息论的内在动机方法。

Method: 预测轨迹采样与贝叶斯探索 (PTS-BE)

Result: 证明了这些奖励自然地表示认知信息增益，并在智能体对环境的动态和奖励足够确定时收敛到零，从而使探索与真正的知识差距对齐。对基于 IG 的方法提供了正式的保证。

Conclusion: PTS-BE在各种具有稀疏奖励和/或纯探索性任务的环境中，显著优于其他基线。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了 DAID 框架，通过干预公平性来提高泛化性，并在深度伪造检测中取得了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测模型面临泛化性和人口群体之间的公平性两个挑战，而现有方法表明这两个目标本质上是冲突的。

Method: 提出了 Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID) 框架，包括 demographic-aware 数据重平衡和 demographic-agnostic 特征聚合。

Result: DAID 在三个跨域基准测试中，在公平性和泛化性方面均取得了优异的性能。

Conclusion: DAID在公平性和泛化性方面均优于现有检测器，验证了其理论基础和实际有效性。

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: 我们提出了一个用于优化抗体序列以获得良好可开发性的计算框架，该框架结合了引导离散扩散模型和基于软价值的解码模块，可以在不影响自然性的前提下偏向采样，从而提高预测的可开发性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 治疗性抗体不仅需要高亲和力靶标结合，还需要良好的可制造性、稳定性和安全性才能实现临床有效性。这些特性统称为“可开发性”。

Method: 我们引入了一个引导离散扩散模型，该模型在来自观察抗体空间 (OAS) 的天然配对重链和轻链序列以及 246 种临床阶段抗体的定量可开发性测量数据上进行训练。为了引导生成生物物理上可行的候选者，我们集成了一个基于软价值的扩散解码 (SVDD) 模块，该模块在不影响自然性的前提下偏向采样。

Result: 在无约束采样中，我们的模型重现了天然序列和已批准疗法的全局特征，并且在 SVDD 指导下，我们实现了预测的可开发性评分相对于无指导基线的显着丰富。

Conclusion: 该框架结合高通量可开发性分析，实现了一个迭代的、机器学习驱动的抗体设计流程，该流程可以同时满足结合和生物物理标准。

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像领域受到数据稀缺和隐私法规的限制，联邦学习存在通信成本高和灵活性不足的问题。

Method: 使用差分隐私条件变分自编码器(DP-CVAE)建模全局的、具有隐私意识的数据分布。

Result: 该方法提高了隐私性、可扩展性和效率，DP-CVAE比DP-CGAN产生更高质量的嵌入，同时参数减少了5倍。

Conclusion: DP-CVAE方法在保证差分隐私的前提下，能够生成高质量的嵌入，支持各种下游任务，并且优于传统的FL分类器。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

*Thomas Hazenberg,Yao Ma,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Marijn van Rijswijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study uses MARL to improve dynamic pricing in supply chains, finding that MADDPG offers a balanced approach between market competition, fairness, and stable pricing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply chains.

Method: evaluate the performance of three MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines, within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and a LightGBM demand prediction model.

Result: rule-based agents achieve near-perfect fairness and the highest price stability, but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest volatility and the lowest fairness. MADDPG provides a more balanced approach, supporting market competition while maintaining relatively high fairness and stable pricing.

Conclusion: MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习算法，该算法降低了数据传输成本，同时限制了对抗性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习 (FL) 机制通常需要每个客户端将其权重传输到中央服务器，而不管它们有多有用。为了避免从客户端到中央服务器的浪费性数据传输成本，

Method: 我们建议使用基于共识的协议来识别每个数据传输步骤中具有最有用模型权重的客户端子集。首先，我们从性能的角度探讨了现有流体民主协议在 FL 中的应用，并将它们与传统的一人一票（也称为 1p1v 或 FedAvg）进行比较。我们提出了一种新的流体民主协议，名为粘性保留民主，在与现有流体民主协议相同的假设下，该协议始终优于 1p1v，同时也不允许积累影响力。

Result: 粘性保留民主始终优于 1p1v，同时不允许积累影响力。我们提出了一种算法 (FedVRD)，该算法通过利用委托拓扑动态地限制对抗者的影响，同时最大限度地降低成本。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种新算法 (FedVRD)，该算法通过利用委托拓扑动态地限制对抗者的影响，同时最大限度地降低成本。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

TL;DR: FoG, inspired by neuroscience, improves deep RL by forgetting early experiences and growing neural capacity, achieving better performance on continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep reinforcement learning methods suffer from primacy bias, limiting sample efficiency and generalizability. Humans are less susceptible to this due to infantile amnesia.

Method: Introduce Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) to reduce the influence of early experiences and Network Expansion to dynamically add new parameters during training.

Result: FoG demonstrates superior performance against SoTA deep RL algorithms on four major continuous control benchmarks with more than 40 tasks.

Conclusion: FoG outperforms existing deep RL algorithms on continuous control benchmarks.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的分类方法，该方法通过最小化熵函数来寻找超平面，以分离不同的类别，并且数值实验验证了该方法的效率和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是找到一个超平面，将对应于两个不同类别的两组点分开。

Method: 通过最小化在未知变量空间上定义的基于熵的函数，寻找以原点为中心的有界N维超立方体中的参数向量和${\mathbb R}^M$中的正向量。

Result: 该方法扩展到多项式曲面，允许通过更复杂的决策边界分离数据点。这为传统的线性或二次优化技术（如支持向量机和梯度下降）提供了一个稳健的替代方案。

Conclusion: 数值实验表明，该方法在处理包括线性和非线性可分性在内的各种分类任务中，具有效率和通用性。

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

TL;DR: 2-simplicial Transformer is more token efficient than standard Transformers on tasks like math, coding, reasoning, and logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern large language models increasingly rely on massive internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize token efficiency.

Method: use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation

Result: 2-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

Conclusion: 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than standard Transformers, outperforming them on tasks involving mathematics, coding, reasoning, and logic.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文研究了具有偏差离线数据的上下文在线定价问题。

Method: 论文提出了一个乐观面对不确定性（OFU）的策略，并设计了一个稳健的变体算法。

Result: 对于标量价格弹性情况，论文确定了实例相关的量 $\delta^2$，它衡量了离线数据与（未知）在线最优值的距离。论文表明，时间长度 $T$、偏差界 $V$、大小 $N$ 和离线数据的离散度 $\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$，以及 $\delta^2$ 共同决定了统计复杂性。对于一般价格弹性，论文建立了一个最坏情况下的 minimax 最优率，并提供了一个实现它的广义 OFU 算法。当偏差界 $V$ 未知时，论文设计了一个稳健的变体，它总是保证次线性遗憾，并且只要精确偏差很小，就可以严格改进纯在线方法。

Conclusion: 这篇论文为存在偏差的离线数据的情境定价提供了第一个严格的遗憾保证。这些技术也完全适用于具有偏差离线数据的随机线性 bandits，产生类似的结果。

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

*Ricardo Buitrago Ruiz,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 循环模型无法推广到比训练长度更长的序列。通过在训练后增加状态覆盖率，我们可以提高长度泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于状态空间模型和线性注意力等循环模型在序列长度上具有线性复杂性，因此最近变得流行。由于它们的循环性质，原则上它们可以处理任意长的序列，但是它们的性能有时会大大降低，超出它们的训练上下文长度——即，它们无法进行长度泛化。

Method: 通过用高斯噪声或不同输入序列的最终状态初始化状态来增加模型训练状态的覆盖范围。

Result: 我们提供了全面的经验和理论分析，以支持未探索状态的假设，该假设认为，当模型在训练期间仅暴露于所有可获得状态分布的有限子集时（即，如果将循环应用于长序列将获得的状态），模型无法进行长度泛化。

Conclusion: 简单的训练干预措施能够实现长度泛化，适用于比训练上下文长几个数量级的序列，并在长上下文任务中表现出改进的性能，从而提供了一种简单有效的方法来实现通用循环模型中强大的长度泛化。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

TL;DR: This paper proposes GRADUATE, a multicalibrated survival model that improves calibration across subpopulations by framing it as a constrained optimization problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival models are typically calibrated at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated for one or more minority subpopulations.

Method: GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination in-training.

Result: The optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate GRADUATE's efficacy. 

Conclusion: The paper introduces GRADUATE, a survival model that achieves multicalibration by framing it as a constrained optimization problem. Empirical results on clinical datasets demonstrate GRADUATE's efficacy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

Conclusion: 建立了可复制均匀性测试和接近性测试的近优样本复杂度下界。

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the
framework of algorithmic replicability. Specifically, given independent samples
from a collection of probability distributions, the goal is to characterize the
sample complexity of replicably testing natural properties of the underlying
distributions. On the algorithmic front, we develop new replicable algorithms
for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of biased treatment effect estimates due to differences between training data and inference time text descriptions, proposing a new framework using large language models to mitigate this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in medicine, but the discrepancy between data available during training and inference (text descriptions) can lead to biased estimates.

Method: The paper proposes a novel framework for estimating treatment effects that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding, leveraging large language models and a custom doubly robust learner.

Result: The paper shows that the discrepancy between training and inference time data can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects, formalizing this as an inference time text confounding problem.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in real-world applications through experiments.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.
