While moving object scenarios have long been researched in the context of spatio-temporal data management, reactive behavior is usually left to complex end-user implementations. However, it is not just a matter of hardwiring reactive constraints: the required solutions need to satisfy tight low-latency computation requirements and be scalable. This paper explores a novel approach to enrich a distributed actor-based framework with reactive functionality and complex spatial data management along with concurrency semantics. Our approach relies on a proposal of the moving actor abstraction, which is a conceptual enhancement of the actor model with reactive sensing, movement, and spatial querying capabilities. This enhancement helps developers of reactive moving object applications avoid the significant burden of implementing application-level schemes to balance performance and consistency. Based on moving actors, we define a reactive moving object data management platform, named Moving Actor-Oriented Databases (M-AODBs), and build Dolphin -- an implementation of M-AODBs. Dolphin embodies a non-intrusive actor-based design layered on top of the Microsoft Orleans distributed virtual actor framework. In a set of experimental evaluations with realistic reactive moving object scenarios, Dolphin exhibits scalability on multi-machines and provides near-real-time reaction latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8Actor\u62bd\u8c61\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0factor\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5e76\u53d1\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u53cd\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u901a\u5e38\u7559\u7ed9\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u6237\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u79fb\u52a8Actor\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u5bf9Actor\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53cd\u5e94\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8Actor\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u5e73\u53f0M-AODBs\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86Dolphin\uff0c\u5b83\u662fM-AODBs\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cDolphin\u5728\u591a\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune.

However, existing multi-stage advertising recommendation systems suffer from objective misalignment and error propagation, making it difficult to achieve global optimality, while unified generative recommendation models still struggle to meet the demands of practical industrial applications. To address these issues, we propose GPR (Generative Pre-trained Recommender), the first one-model framework that redefines advertising recommendation as an end-to-end generative task, replacing the traditional cascading paradigm with a unified generative approach. To realize GPR, we introduce three key innovations spanning unified representation, network architecture, and training strategy. First, we design a unified input schema and tokenization method tailored to advertising scenarios, mapping both ads and organic content into a shared multi-level semantic ID space, thereby enhancing semantic alignment and modeling consistency across heterogeneous data.

Finally, we propose a multi-stage joint training strategy that integrates Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), Value-Aware Fine-Tuning and the Hierarchy Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO) algorithm, forming a complete generative recommendation pipeline that unifies interest modeling, value alignment, and policy optimization.

Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy.

However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security.

Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-\u03b1 constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency.

However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system.

To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner.\n  Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests).

Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels.

To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

In practice, grouping often comes at the expense of key metrics such calibration error and predictive accuracy. This is due to the restrictive inductive bias that mixture-of-experts imposes, that predictions for individual patients must look like predictions for the group they're assigned to. Might we be able to discover patient group structure, where it exists, while improving calibration and predictive accuracy?

This limitation arises from their substantial hardware requirements, latency constraints, and the necessity to maintain clearly defined knowledge boundaries within a game setting. In this paper, we propose a modular NPC dialogue system that leverages Small Language Models (SLMs), fine-tuned to encode specific NPC personas and integrated with runtime-swappable memory modules. These memory modules preserve character-specific conversational context and world knowledge, enabling expressive interactions and long-term memory without retraining or model reloading during gameplay. We comprehensively evaluate our system using three open-source SLMs: DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Mistral-7B-Instruct, trained on synthetic persona-aligned data and benchmarked on consumer-grade hardware. While our approach is motivated by applications in gaming, its modular design and persona-driven memory architecture hold significant potential for broader adoption in domains requiring expressive, scalable, and memory-rich conversational agents, such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, or interactive educational systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684 NPC \u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (SLM)\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7684 NPC \u89d2\u8272\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u5728\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9650\u5236\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (SLM)\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7684 NPC \u89d2\u8272\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u5b58\u7279\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u8f7d\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90 SLM\uff08DistilGPT-2\u3001TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat \u548c Mistral-7B-Instruct\uff09\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b SLM \u7ecf\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u89d2\u8272\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u865a\u62df\u52a9\u624b\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u652f\u6301\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6216\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages.

We address this limitation by shifting from a model-centric to a data-centric approach and introduce PriVi, a large-scale primate-centric video pretraining dataset. PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels.

To illustrate its scalability, we show that SynthTools can readily produce toolsets that span twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work. Furthermore, the tool simulation and tool audit components demonstrate strong reliability, achieving $94\\%$ and $99\\%$ accuracy respectively. Finally, we construct downstream tasks from the generated tools that even state-of-the-art models struggle to complete. By enabling scalable, diverse, and reliable tool ecosystems, SynthTools provides a practical path toward large-scale training and stable evaluation of tool-use agents.

A hybrid architecture comprising two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed: one for mode prediction and another for filtering that is based on a mode-augmented version of the recently presented KalmanNet architecture. The proposed RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy that enables mutual adaptation without supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems, including target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed JMFNet framework outperforms classical model-based filters (e.g., interacting multiple models and particle filters) as well as model-free deep learning baselines, particularly in non-stationary and high-noise regimes. It is also showcased that JMFNet achieves a small yet meaningful improvement over the KalmanNet framework, which becomes much more pronounced in complicated systems or long trajectories. Finally, the method's performance is empirically validated to be consistent and reliable, exhibiting low sensitivity to initial conditions, hyperparameter selection, as well as to incorrect model knowledge", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5177\u6709\u672a\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u672a\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc (RNN)\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 KalmanNet \u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u7248\u672c\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 RNN \u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7b56\u7565\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u4e92\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u6f5c\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u949f\u6446\u89d2\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001Lorenz \u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 JMFNet \u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u548c\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u3002\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 JMFNet \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4 KalmanNet \u6846\u67b6\u5c0f\u4f46\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6216\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027"}}

Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.\n  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff08KR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u878d\u5165\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6c47\u96c6\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u79d1\u548cAI\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u65e8\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6574\u5408\u548c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5f25\u5408\u4f7f\u7528transformers\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics. This short paper shows that, under certain common circumstances, there are no disadvantages to imposing exact symmetries; the ML4PS community should consider group averaging as a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u662f\u7cbe\u786e\u7b49\u53d8\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u91c7\u7528\u7b49\u53d8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u539f\u56e0\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u671f\u671b\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u7b49\u53d8\u5b9e\u73b0\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e00\u5c0f\u7ec4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u5747\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747\u8bc4\u4f30\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728VRMSE\u65b9\u9762\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad837%\u3002\u5e73\u5747\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ea7\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5e38\u89c1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6ca1\u6709\u7f3a\u70b9\uff1bML4PS\u793e\u533a\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u4f7f\u7528\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5ec9\u4ef7\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines.

However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore and propose a framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models.

Jaiman"], "title": "HeatGen: A Guided Diffusion Framework for Multiphysics Heat Sink Design Optimization", "comment": null, "summary": "This study presents a generative optimization framework based on a guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that leverages surrogate gradients to generate heat sink designs minimizing pressure drop while maintaining surface temperatures below a specified threshold. Geometries are represented using boundary representations of multiple fins, and a multi-fidelity approach is employed to generate training data. Using this dataset, along with vectors representing the boundary representation geometries, we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate heat sinks with characteristics consistent with those observed in the data. We train two different residual neural networks to predict the pressure drop and surface temperature for each geometry. We use the gradients of these surrogate models with respect to the design variables to guide the geometry generation process toward satisfying the low-pressure and surface temperature constraints. This inference-time guidance directs the generative process toward heat sink designs that not only prevent overheating but also achieve lower pressure drops compared to traditional optimization methods such as CMA-ES. In contrast to traditional black-box optimization approaches, our method is scalable, provided sufficient training data is available. Unlike traditional topology optimization methods, once the model is trained and the heat sink world model is saved, inference under new constraints (e.g., temperature) is computationally inexpensive and does not require retraining. Samples generated using the guided diffusion model achieve pressure drops up to 10 percent lower than the limits obtained by traditional black-box optimization methods.

This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric.

A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics.

Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift.

However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback.

We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative.

Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\\%$ to $70\\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts.

Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline.

Instead, it may be easier to directly describe algorithmic bias through ad-hoc assumptions specific to a particular real-world task, e.g., based on background information on systemic biases in its context. Such assumptions can, in turn, be used to mitigate this bias during training. Yet, a framework for incorporating such assumptions that is simultaneously principled, flexible, and interpretable is currently lacking.\n  Our approach is to formalize bias assumptions as programs in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language that allows for the description of probabilistic causal relationships through logic. Neurosymbolic extensions of ProbLog then allow for easy integration of these assumptions in a neural network's training process. We propose a set of templates to express different types of bias and show the versatility of our approach on synthetic tabular datasets with known biases. Using estimates of the bias distortions present, we also succeed in mitigating algorithmic bias in real-world tabular and image data.

This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from $H$ independent $O(N^2)$ computations into a single, collaborative $O(N^2)$ computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of $H$. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Extensive empirical validation on the OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B model series demonstrates that while delivering an approximately two-fold increase in training throughput, its performance is on par with standard dense attention, even surpassing it on select key metrics, while consistently outperforming representative sparse attention methods including Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPAttention\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u3001\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5e26\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6765\u6362\u53d6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7a00\u758f(SPAttention)\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u603b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u3001\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5e26\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5934\u90e8\u6307\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728OLMoE-1B-7B\u548c0.25B-1.75B\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cSPAttention\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5927\u7ea6\u4e24\u500d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5b83\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ecLongformer\u3001Reformer\u548cBigBird\u3002", "conclusion": "SPAttention\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5934\u90e8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4ece\u5197\u4f59\u5efa\u6a21\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human \"gold\" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication.

This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes. Meanwhile, empirical studies in synthetic and real-world benchmarks further verify the effectiveness of our alternating framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u9006\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u504f\u597d\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6602\u8d35\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff08P-EMOPs\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfb\u627e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u96c6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cP-EMOPs \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u65e0\u9650\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u6602\u8d35\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\uff081\uff09\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u534f\u540c\u7684\u91c7\u96c6\u9a71\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u548c\uff082\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u91c7\u6837\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u9006\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u4ea4\u66ff\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u53c2\u6570\u5316 EMOP \u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6602\u8d35\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions.

This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset.

It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u516b\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u7528\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u7076\uff0c\u6240\u6709FMs\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u5b9a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\uff08\u533b\u5b66\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\uff09\u3001\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u80a5\u5927\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5272\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u533b\u5b66FMs\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u663e\u8457\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5fc3\u810f\uff09\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u590d\u6742\u7684\u75c5\u7076\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u6c14\u80f8\uff09\uff0c\u6240\u6709FMs\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u533b\u5b66\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u6709\u76ca\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands. Critically, this approach empowers the artist and supports long-term preservation and exhibition of artworks with AI components.

However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance. A popular approach to incorporate risk sensitivity is to optimize a specific quantile of the cumulative reward distribution. In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $\u03c4$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate. We show that UCB-QRL yields a high-probability regret bound $\\mathcal O\\left((2/\u03ba)^{H+1}H\\sqrt{SATH\\log(2SATH/\u03b4)}\\right)$ in the episodic setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and $H$ horizons.

This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues.

Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u540c\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5448\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u8679\u819c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5404\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u671d\u7740\u4ee3\u8868\u76f8\u540c\u8eab\u4efd\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u64cd\u7eb5\u4e00\u4e9b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u7531\u7279\u5b9a\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u8679\u819c\u5927\u5c0f\u6216\u77b3\u5b54\u4e0e\u8679\u819c\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\uff09\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u56fe\u50cf\u6240\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u64cd\u7eb5\u4efb\u4f55\u53ef\u4ee5\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u53ef\u5fae\u635f\u5931\u9879\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 GAN \u6a21\u578b\u6216\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528 GAN \u53cd\u6f14\u5c06\u4efb\u4f55\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u5176\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5408\u6210\u540c\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5448\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model.

To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training.

Graphical models, however, are inefficient for high-dimensional data because they require substantial memory and must be retrained from scratch whenever the graph structure changes, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods, like GEM, overcome these limitations by using generator neural networks for improved scalability. However, empirical comparisons have mostly focused on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce GEM+, which integrates AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's scalable generator network.

To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average.

While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u514d\u793a\u4f8b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08EFCL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u79fb\u690d\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u533a\u57df\u5230\u4f4e\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u5e73\u6ed1\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08PTM\uff09\u7684EFCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c42\u9762\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u6216\u53cd\u5411\u504f\u659c\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPANDA\u7684patch\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8ePTM\u7684EFCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002PANDA\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9891\u7e41\u7c7b\u522b\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u6765\u653e\u5927\u4f4e\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cPANDA\u8fd8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u5e73\u6ed1\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u5931\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cPANDA\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8ePTM\u7684CL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u8d77\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "PANDA\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u514d\u793a\u4f8b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments.

Nonetheless, in practice, they often struggle to explore the reward landscape evenly: trajectories toward easy-to-reach regions dominate training, while hard-to-reach modes receive vanishing or uninformative gradients, leading to poor coverage of high-reward areas. We address this imbalance with Boosted GFlowNets, a method that sequentially trains an ensemble of GFlowNets, each optimizing a residual reward that compensates for the mass already captured by previous models. This residual principle reactivates learning signals in underexplored regions and, under mild assumptions, ensures a monotone non-degradation property: adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it.

However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains.

For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the fusion of machine learning and quantum computing (QC), can provide transformative solutions to the challenges faced by classical ML models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive exploration of QAI for MC systems. We begin with a conceptual background to quantum computing, MC systems, and quantum machine learning (QAI). We then examine the core mechanisms and algorithmic principles of QAI in MC systems, including quantum-enhanced learning pipelines, quantum uncertainty quantification, and quantum explainability frameworks. Subsequently, we discuss key application areas like aerospace, defense, cybersecurity, smart grids, and disaster management, focusing on the role of QA in enhancing fault tolerance, real-time intelligence, and adaptability. We provide an exploration of the positioning of QAI for MC systems in the industry in terms of deployment. We also propose a model for management of quantum resources and scheduling of applications driven by timeliness constraints.

Most existing black-box attacks focus on vector-based or discrete-action RL, and their effectiveness on image-based continuous control is limited by the large action space and excessive environment queries. We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency.

Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Lumos3D achieves high- fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases.

However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement.

While current in-silicon directed evolution algorithms focus on designing search strategies, they overlook how to utilize the transformative protein language models, which encode rich evolutionary patterns, to guide search. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework to evolve protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model.

Originally proposed as a generalization of the binary spatter code model, it aims to provide higher representational power while remaining a lighter alternative to models requiring high-precision components. Despite this potential, MCR has received limited attention. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs and comparisons with other models are lacking, sustaining the perception that its added complexity outweighs the improved expressivity. In this work, we revisit MCR by presenting its first extensive evaluation, demonstrating that it achieves a unique balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experiments measuring capacity demonstrate that MCR outperforms binary and integer vectors while approaching complex-valued representations at a fraction of their memory footprint. Evaluation on 123 datasets confirms consistent accuracy gains and shows that MCR can match the performance of binary spatter codes using up to 4x less memory. We investigate the hardware realization of MCR by showing that it maps naturally to digital logic and by designing the first dedicated accelerator. Evaluations on basic operations and 7 selected datasets demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude and significant energy reductions compared to software implementation. When matched for accuracy against binary spatter codes, MCR achieves on average 3.08x faster execution and 2.68x lower energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that, although MCR requires more sophisticated operations than binary spatter codes, its modular arithmetic and higher per-component precision enable lower dimensionality. When realized with dedicated hardware, this results in a faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative to existing models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u590d\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff08MCR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7b97\u672f\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6574\u6570\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "MCR\u6a21\u578b\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6bd4\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u6743\u8861\u548c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bb9\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001123\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u53ca\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "MCR\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u548c\u6574\u6570\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u590d\u6570\u503c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u5728123\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c114\u500d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5339\u914d\u4e8c\u5143\u6e85\u5c04\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e0e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "MCR\u867d\u7136\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u4e8c\u5143\u6e85\u5c04\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u4e14\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a \"simulated textbook\" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6 (KC) \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760 LLM \u751f\u6210\u7684 KC \u6570\u91cf\u8fc7\u591a\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86 KC \u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6 (KC) \u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u662f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316 KC \u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528 GPT-4o-mini \u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6 (646 \u9053\u9009\u62e9\u9898) \u91c7\u7528 \"\u6a21\u62df\u6559\u79d1\u4e66\" LLM \u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210 KC\u3002\n2. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u5e76\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684 KC \u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "1. \u521d\u59cb\u7684 LLM \u81ea\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684 KC \u6a21\u578b (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206)\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u8fc7\u591a\u7684 KC (569 vs. 101)\u3002\n2. \u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f53\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u4e3a 0.8 \u65f6\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0cKC \u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u5230 428\uff0cRMSE \u63d0\u5347\u5230 0.4259\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u9760\u6269\u5c55 LLM \u751f\u6210 KC \u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u6539\u8fdb KC \u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Animating Human Avatars in Diverse Scenes with Gaussian Splatting", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528 3D \u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04 (3DGS) \u5728 3D \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u52a8\u753b\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u5728 novel-view \u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u903c\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4eba\u7269\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u753b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u6216\u70b9\u4e91\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e95\u5c42 3D \u8868\u793a\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u753b\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 3DGS \u4f5c\u4e3a 3D \u8868\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4eba\u7269\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4eba\u7269\u548c\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9\u4e0e 3D \u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5408\u6210\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u4eba\u7269\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u59ff\u52bf\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u7269\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u65af\u7ec6\u5316\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u903c\u771f\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u6765\u81ea Scannet++ \u548c SuperSplat \u5e93\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4eba\u7269\u6355\u83b7\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5934\u50cf\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5141\u8bb8\u65b0\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u65b0\u52a8\u753b\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u7684\u5355\u773c RGB \u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 3DGS \u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u773c\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings, including to help ensure the safety of future systems. Unfortunately, frontier and future systems may not be sufficiently trustworthy, and there is evidence that these systems may even be misaligned with their developers or users. Therefore, we investigate the capabilities of AI agents to act against the interests of their users when conducting ML engineering, by sabotaging ML models, sandbagging their performance, and subverting oversight mechanisms. First, we extend MLE-Bench, a benchmark for realistic ML tasks, with code-sabotage tasks such as implanting backdoors and purposefully causing generalisation failures. Frontier agents make meaningful progress on our sabotage tasks. In addition, we study agent capabilities to sandbag on MLE-Bench. Agents can calibrate their performance to specified target levels below their actual capability. To mitigate sabotage, we use LM monitors to detect suspicious agent behaviour, and we measure model capability to sabotage and sandbag without being detected by these monitors. Overall, monitors are capable at detecting code-sabotage attempts but our results suggest that detecting sandbagging is more difficult. Additionally, aggregating multiple monitor predictions works well, but monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable to mitigate sabotage in high-stakes domains.

Deep learning-based surrogate models typically specialize in a single PDE with fixed parameters. We present a framework for equation-aware emulation that generalizes to unseen PDEs, conditioning a neural model on a vector encoding representing the terms in a PDE and their coefficients. We present a baseline of four distinct modeling technqiues, trained on a family of 1D PDEs from the APEBench suite.

However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks.

These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification.

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain.

Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps. This work positions CFM as a powerful and practical alternative for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowCast\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08CFM\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u964d\u6c34\u4e34\u8fd1\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0cCFM\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u5927\u5927\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u964d\u6c34\u4e34\u8fd1\u9884\u62a5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6d2a\u6c34\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5df2\u7ecf\u5927\u5927\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FlowCast\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08CFM\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u964d\u6c34\u4e34\u8fd1\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "result": "FlowCast\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\uff0cCFM\u76ee\u6807\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06CFM\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u800c\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions.

Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions.

Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries.

Part-1 is trained locally at each client and aggregated by the aggregator at the end of each round. Part-2 is trained at a server that sequentially processes the intermediate activations received from each client. We study the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in SFL in the presence of data heterogeneity. In detail, due to the nature of SFL, local updates of part-1 may drift away from global optima, while part-2 is sensitive to the processing sequence, similar to forgetting in continual learning (CL). Specifically, we observe that the trained model performs better in classes (labels) seen at the end of the sequence. We investigate this phenomenon with emphasis on key aspects of SFL, such as the processing order at the server and the cut layer. Based on our findings, we propose Hydra, a novel mitigation method inspired by multi-head neural networks and adapted for the SFL's setting. Extensive numerical evaluations show that Hydra outperforms baselines and methods from the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\uff0cSFL\u4e2d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff08CF\uff09\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Hydra\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u591a\u5934\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eSFL\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0cpart-1\u7684\u672c\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u504f\u79bb\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u800cpart-2\u5bf9\u5904\u7406\u987a\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86SFL\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7684\u5904\u7406\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u5207\u5272\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Hydra\u3002", "result": "Hydra\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Hydra\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f13\u89e3SFL\u4e2d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines.

Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \\textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \\textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection.

Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner.

We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time.

However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.\n  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\uff08SCD\uff09\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u5141\u8bb8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u6587\u6863\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\u6765\u6267\u884c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ee5\u975e\u9884\u671f\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548cLLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\uff08SCD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u7684tokens\u6765\u6e29\u548c\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSCD\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SCD\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence.

Version with Appendix", "summary": "We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning. We hope this work will inspire further efforts toward more temporally and culturally adaptive LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86SPAN\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u65e5\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u65e5\u5386\u5185\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65e5\u5386\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728SPAN\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u6765\u65e5\u671f\u9000\u5316\u548c\u65e5\u5386\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8de8\u65e5\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u8de8\u65e5\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aSPAN\u7684\u8de8\u65e5\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u65e5\u5386\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u30022. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u548c\u65e0\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u30023. \u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u65e5\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728SPAN\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a34.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u6765\u65e5\u671f\u9000\u5316\u548c\u65e5\u5386\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8695.31%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u65e5\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9LLM\u6765\u8bf4\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u7684\u8de8\u65e5\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u6fc0\u53d1\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6587\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94LLM\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic. Extensive experiments on up to 24 GPUs with LLaMA-style models show that TawPipe achieves superior throughput and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "TawPipe\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8282\u70b9\u5185\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5e76\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8de8\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709pipeline parallelism\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u9650\uff0cweight-passing\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u5185\u5e26\u5bbd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "TawPipe\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u5206\u7ec4\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u7247\u5206\u914d\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u53e0\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u572824\u4e2aGPU\u4e0a\u5bf9LLaMA\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cTawPipe\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TawPipe\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u8282\u70b9\u5185\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8de8\u8282\u70b9\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSAM-DAQ\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7fSAM\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u663e\u8457\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eRGB-D\u89c6\u9891\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b(RGB-D VSOD)\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u4ee5\u53ca\u5185\u5b58\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec:1)\u90e8\u7f72\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e76\u884c\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668(PAMIE)\uff0c\u5b83\u4ee5\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u9002\u914d\u5668(DPA)\u30022)\u90e8\u7f72\u4e00\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6(QTM)\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aRGB-D VSOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SAM-DAQ\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SAM-DAQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RGB-D\u89c6\u9891\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.\n  Trained on seventeen years of S&P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts.

Existing approaches often employ dense network architectures with a high parameter count, leading to increased model complexity and resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose RWKV-PCSSC, a lightweight point cloud semantic scene completion network inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a RWKV Seed Generator (RWKV-SG) module that can aggregate features from a partial point cloud to produce a coarse point cloud with coarse features.

By leveraging a compact and efficient design, our method achieves a lightweight model representation. Experimental results demonstrate that RWKV-PCSSC reduces the parameter count by 4.18$\\times$ and improves memory efficiency by 1.37$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art methods PointSSC.

Servedio"], "title": "Is nasty noise actually harder than malicious noise?", "comment": "To appear in SODA 2026", "summary": "We consider the relative abilities and limitations of computationally efficient algorithms for learning in the presence of noise, under two well-studied and challenging adversarial noise models for learning Boolean functions: malicious noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a random subset of examples given to the learner; and nasty noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt an adversarially chosen subset of examples given to the learner.\n  We consider both the distribution-independent and fixed-distribution settings. Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $\u03b7$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $\u03b7$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $\u03b7_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $\u03b7_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.\n  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $\u03b7$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $\u03b7/2$-rate nasty noise.

While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text.

Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring.

Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u8be6\u5c3d\u7684\u62bd\u6837\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u7801\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570 next-token \u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u9ec4\u91d1\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952e token \u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "HPR \u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) hinter (\u5f3a\u5927\u7684 LLM)\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b2) practitioner (\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b)\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u5728\u4e8e Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316 practitioner \u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e hinter \u7684\u9884\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u9884\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHPR \u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86state-of-the-art\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff1a\u5b83\u4ee5\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801 1/5 \u7684 token \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e self-consistency \u548c MCTS \u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684 FLOPs \u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa\u6700\u591a 5.1% \u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "HPR \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u9884\u70b9\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows (\"tokens\") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroLingua\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u7761\u7720\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u751f\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u5c42Transformer\u548c\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8111\u7535\u548c\u773c\u52a8\u878d\u5408\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c0630\u79d2\u7684\u7761\u7720\u65f6\u671f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a3\u79d2\u7684\u5b50\u7a97\u53e3\uff08\u201ctokens\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CNN tokenizer\u548c\u53cc\u5c42Transformer\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u878d\u5408\u8111\u7535\u548c\u773c\u52a8\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728Sleep-EDF\u548cISRUC-Sleep\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728Sleep-EDF\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86state-of-the-art\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0885.3%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c0.800 macro F1\uff0c0.796 Cohen's kappa\uff09\uff0c\u5728ISRUC\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0881.9%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c0.802 macro F1\uff0c0.755 kappa\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroLingua\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7761\u7720\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec4\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u66f4\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes.

One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks (\\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019), and the results demonstrate that the proposed method boosts the generalization ability by 5.5\\% Average Precision (AP) when embedded in YOLOv5 (anchor-based) and YOLOx (anchor-free) baselines.

However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned.

In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations.

However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGraphIF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5305\u542b\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\u3001\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u91cd\u5199\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGraphIF\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "GraphIF\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7684LLM\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement.

Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method.

This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task. Furthermore, four variants (CaReTS1--4) are instantiated under this framework to incorporate mainstream temporal modelling encoders, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers.

Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc1\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f3012\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u5c0f\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5e94\u66f4\u52a0\u91cd\u89c6\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b (IFM) \u63a5\u8fd1\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd (AGI) \u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u4e0e\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u5185\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b (FM) \u4e0d\u540c\uff0cIFM \u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b (FM) \u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b (IFM) \u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "IFM \u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u79f0\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u83b7\u7c7b\u4f3c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5373\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u96c6\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u72b6\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7cfb\u7edf\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u6574\u5408\u548c\u5904\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u4ece\u667a\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u521b\u65b0\u5171\u540c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u7740\u671d\u7740\u771f\u6b63 AGI \u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

To ensure individual-global-max (IGM) consistency, existing methods either enforce monotonicity constraints, which limit expressive power, or adopt softer surrogates at the cost of algorithmic complexity. In this work, we present a dynamical systems analysis of non-monotonic value decomposition, modeling learning dynamics as continuous-time gradient flow. We prove that, under approximately greedy exploration, all zero-loss equilibria violating IGM consistency are unstable saddle points, while only IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors of the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments on both synthetic matrix games and challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrate that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms monotonic baselines. Additionally, we investigate the influence of temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies, providing actionable insights for the design of future value-based MARL algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u4ef7\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e2a\u4f53-\u5168\u5c40-\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff08IGM\uff09\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5355\u8c03\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4fdd\u8bc1IGM\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u4ef7\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d2a\u5a6a\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8fdd\u53cdIGM\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u96f6\u635f\u5931\u5747\u8861\u90fd\u662f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u978d\u70b9\uff0c\u800c\u53ea\u6709IGM\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89e3\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u77e9\u9635\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684MARL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5206\u89e3\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6062\u590dIGM\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684MARL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT.

In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\\ell)$, where $i\\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\\ell\\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \\textit{feasible} arm with the \\textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-\u03b4$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \\textit{asymptotically ($\u03b4\\rightarrow 0$) optimal}. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art BAI algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u662f\u5728\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u4e00\u7ec4 K \u4e2a\u81c2\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u81c2\u3002\u4e0e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5141\u8bb8\u5206\u522b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81c2\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u81c2\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u989d\u5916\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u627e\u5230\u836f\u6548\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u836f\u7269\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5176\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u6eb6\u89e3\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e9b\u5b89\u5168\u9608\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u6548\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u5206\u5f00\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u81c2\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e0a\u9650\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e0b\u9650\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684 BAI \u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027 BAI \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types.

Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u964d\u566a\u6846\u67b6DenoGrad\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a8\u6001\u7ea0\u6b63\u566a\u58f0\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u5c24\u5176\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u5173\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u65e0\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u800c\u5f02\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u964d\u566a\u6846\u67b6DenoGrad\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u3002DenoGrad\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u7ea0\u6b63\u566a\u58f0\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cDenoGrad\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002DenoGrad\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u964d\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91caIA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DenoGrad\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u964d\u566a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u6821\u6b63\u566a\u58f0\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDenoGrad\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u964d\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91caIA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We analyze the gradient flow associated with overparameterized optimization problems, which can be interpreted as training a neural network with linear activations. Remarkably, we show that the global convergence properties can be derived for any cost function that is proper and real analytic. We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details. Moreover, we show that convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated depending on the initialization, as measured by an imbalance metric introduced in this work. Finally, we discuss how these insights may generalize to neural networks with sigmoidal activations, showing through a simple example which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u4f18\u5316 landscape \u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6807\u91cf\u503c\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d landscape \u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 saddle point \u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u5728\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6210\u672c\u4e2d\u90fd\u662f\u901a\u7528\u7684\uff0c\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4efb\u610f\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c1\u89e3\u5982\u4f55\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5177\u6709 sigmoid \u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u8868\u660e\u54ea\u4e9b\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e4b\u5916\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with \"LogitMap Pairs\" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset.

Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $\u03b3$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\\log(1/\u03b3))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).\n  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/\u03b3)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.\n  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u534a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e86CSQ\u7684\u786c\u5ea6\u58c1\u5792\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u4e60\u534a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u96c6\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u53ea\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u534a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18 \u03b3 \u53ca\u5176\u7ef4\u5ea6 d \u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6ee1\u8db3\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5206\u5e03\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86 Jennrich \u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u77e9\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u4e0a\u7684 PCA\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0cCSQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7136\u9700\u8981\u62df\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5f31\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u67e5\u8be2\uff08SQ\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 poly(d,1/\u03b3) \u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0PAC\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86CSQ\u548cSQ\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u6790\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u7531\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u77e9\u5f20\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength.

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \\textit{M}ultimodal framework, \\textit{MTP}, for urban \\textit{T}raffic \\textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities.

Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) for annotation, but LLM-generated labels still fall short of human-level quality. To address this problem, we propose the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline, where LLMs serve not only as annotators but also as judges to critically identify potential errors. Human effort is then directed towards reviewing only the most \"suspicious\" cases, significantly improving the human annotation efficiency. Our major contributions are as follows: (1) ACT is applicable to a wide range of domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding, by leveraging multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs).

However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\\%$ to $46.61\\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset.

To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns.

Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter. Compared to existing offline alignment methods such as distillation, our approach boosts the number of accepted tokens by up to 35\\% under standard sampling and 22\\% under greedy sampling, all while incurring negligible computational overhead.

Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers.

However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting.

Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains.

This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDifference Vector Equalization (DiVE) \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185 (ID) \u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u9650\u7684 OOD \u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u5dee\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u76f8\u7b49\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u5411\u91cf\u635f\u5931 (AVL) \u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u635f\u5931 (PVL)\u3002", "result": "DiVE \u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728 ID\u3001OOD \u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DiVE \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches rely heavily on handcrafted encodings of one-dimensional (1D) peptide sequences, which can limit generalizability across tasks and datasets. Recently, protein language models (PLMs), such as ESM-2 and ESMFold, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. However, they face two critical challenges. First, fine-tuning is computationally costly. Second, their complex latent representations hinder interpretability for domain experts. Additionally, many frameworks have been developed for specific types of peptide classification, lacking generalization. These limitations restrict the ability to connect model predictions to biologically relevant motifs and structural properties. To address these limitations, we present PepTriX, a novel framework that integrates one dimensional (1D) sequence embeddings and three-dimensional (3D) structural features via a graph attention network enhanced with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention. PepTriX automatically adapts to diverse datasets, producing task-specific peptide vectors while retaining biological plausibility. After evaluation by domain experts, we found that PepTriX performs remarkably well across multiple peptide classification tasks and provides interpretable insights into the structural and biophysical motifs that drive predictions.

Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks.

Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "VocalNet-M2: A low-latency SLM with multi-codebook tokenizer and multi-token prediction.", "motivation": "High response latency in current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) due to autoregressive generation and complex flow-matching models.", "method": "Introduces VocalNet-M2, integrating a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy to directly generate multi-codebook speech tokens.", "result": "Reduces first chunk latency from 725ms to 350ms while maintaining competitive performance.", "conclusion": "Provides insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications through a comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies."}}

To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images. We also construct a new dataset, STIPLAR(Scene Text Image Pairs of Low-resource lAnguages and Real-world data), for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose Text Appearance Similarity (TAS), a novel metric that assesses style preservation by independently measuring font, color, and background similarity, enabling robust evaluation even without ground truth.

In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5 (UGCS)\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u96be\u4ee5\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9009\u62e9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u6700\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60 (RL) \u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8c03\u6574\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1a\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u7ec8\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u6765\u5bf9\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u77ed\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a LLM \u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u56f0\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u3002"}}

However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%. Our work reveals a new class of physically realizable threats and underscores the urgent need for defenses that account for material-level properties in real-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u9762\u5411\u6750\u6599\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff08MOBA\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u6570\u5b57-\u7269\u7406\u57df\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u76843D\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5230\u7269\u7406\u7684\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u3002\u6570\u5b57\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u53cd\u5c04\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7406\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u672a\u7ecf\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u6216\u6613\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "MOBA\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u548c\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u949b\uff08TiO_2\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8be5\u7ba1\u9053\u5177\u6709\uff1a(1) Oren-Nayar BRDF\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b(2) \u8ddd\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u548c\u76f8\u673a-\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMOBA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8693.50%\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd541%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6750\u6599\u7ea7\u522b\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we study the verification of the evolution of conditional-independence (CI) propositions against temporal logic specifications. To this end, we consider two specification formalisms over CI propositions: linear temporal logic (LTL), and non-deterministic B\u00fcchi automata (NBAs). This problem has two variants. Stochastic CI properties take the given concrete probability distributions into account, while structural CI properties are viewed purely in terms of the graphical structure of the DBN.

To address this problem, we propose a fully differentiable, exemplar-free expandable method composed of two complementary memories: One learns common features that can be used across all tasks, and the other combines the shared features to learn discriminative characteristics unique to each sample. Both memories are differentiable so that the network can autonomously learn latent representations for each sample. For each task, the memory adjustment module adaptively prunes critical slots and minimally expands capacity to accommodate new concepts, and orthogonal regularization enforces geometric separation between preserved and newly learned memory components to prevent interference.

Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm.

Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \\textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct.

Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively.

While most previous work has concentrated on optimal search methods, this paper focuses on bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search, where a bound on the suboptimality of the solution cost is specified. We build upon the state-of-the-art optimal bidirectional search algorithm, BAE*, designed for consistent heuristics, and introduce several variants of BAE* specifically tailored for the bounded-suboptimal context. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the performance of these new variants against other bounded-suboptimal bidirectional algorithms as well as the standard weighted A* algorithm.

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSE-Diff\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7efc\u5408\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5(CVD)\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe(ECG)\u662f\u5e94\u7528\u6700\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u3001\u6ce8\u91ca\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u975e\u5e38\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5fc3\u810f\u7535\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u578b\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u3002\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u80cc\u666f\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "SE-Diff\u901a\u8fc7\u640f\u52a8\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b(ODE)\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u4fc3\u8fdb\u751f\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7531llm\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6ce8\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSE-Diff\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6587\u672c-ECG\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6587\u672c-ECG\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e5f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u3002"}}

Weight pruning and coreset selection are two emerging paradigms proposed to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we first explore the interplay between redundant weights and training samples through a transparent analysis: redundant samples, particularly noisy ones, cause model weights to become unnecessarily overtuned to fit them, complicating the identification of irrelevant weights during pruning; conversely, irrelevant weights tend to overfit noisy data, undermining coreset selection effectiveness. To further investigate and harness this interplay in deep learning, we develop a Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring mechanism (SWaST) that alternately performs weight pruning and coreset selection to establish a synergistic effect in training. During this investigation, we observe that when simultaneously removing a large number of weights and samples, a phenomenon we term critical double-loss can occur, where important weights and their supportive samples are mistakenly eliminated at the same time, leading to model instability and nearly irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered in subsequent training. Unlike classic machine learning models, this issue can arise in deep learning due to the lack of theoretical guarantees on the correctness of weight pruning and coreset selection, which explains why these paradigms are often developed independently. We mitigate this by integrating a state preservation mechanism into SWaST, enabling stable joint optimization. Extensive experiments reveal a strong synergy between pruning and coreset selection across varying prune rates and coreset sizes, delivering accuracy boosts of up to 17.83% alongside 10% to 90% FLOPs reductions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u91cd\u526a\u679d\u548ccoreset\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u673a\u5236(SWaST)\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u6743\u91cd\u526a\u679d\u548ccoreset\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u8303\u4f8b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5197\u4f59\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u526a\u679d\u671f\u95f4\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u53d8\u5f97\u590d\u6742\uff1b\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u524a\u5f31coreset\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540c\u6b65\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6837\u672c\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236(SWaST)\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u4ea4\u66ff\u6267\u884c\u6743\u91cd\u526a\u679d\u548ccoreset\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u5230SWaST\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7387\u548ccoreset\u5927\u5c0f\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u526a\u679d\u548ccoreset\u9009\u62e9\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1110%\u523090%\u7684FLOPs\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8617.83%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540c\u65f6\u79fb\u9664\u5927\u91cf\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6837\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e34\u754c\u53cc\u91cd\u635f\u5931\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u53ca\u5176\u652f\u6301\u6837\u672c\u540c\u65f6\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u968f\u540e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u3002"}}

This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies.

Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6 3D \u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u4ee4\u9884\u6d4b 3D \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u88ab\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f74\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u8131\u8282\u5730\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa AffordBot\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (MLLM) \u4e0e\u91cf\u8eab\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe (CoT) \u63a8\u7406\u8303\u4f8b\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f25\u5408 3D \u8f93\u5165\u548c 2D \u517c\u5bb9 MLLM \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6e32\u67d3\u573a\u666f\u7684\u73af\u7ed5\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u5c06 3D \u5143\u7d20\u5019\u9009\u5bf9\u8c61\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684 CoT \u7ba1\u9053\u4ece\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u63d0\u793a MLLM \u6839\u636e\u6307\u4ee4\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u70b9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728 SceneFun3D \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cAffordBot \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528 3D \u70b9\u4e91\u8f93\u5165\u548c MLLM \u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "AffordBot \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528 3D \u70b9\u4e91\u8f93\u5165\u548c MLLM \u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFactGuard\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u4ee5\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u6574\u5408LLM\u5efa\u8bae\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6765\u5bfc\u51faFactGuard-D\uff0c\u4f7f\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u53ef\u6316\u6398\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u63d0\u53d6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u77db\u76fe\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u6574\u5408LLM\u5efa\u8bae\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f97\u5230FactGuard-D\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u98ce\u683c\u654f\u611f\u548cLLM\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.\n  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u589e\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u901a\u7528\u751f\u6210\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u4e14\u5145\u5206\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f18\u52bf\u4ecd\u7136\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6b65\u81ea\u6cbb\u6d41\u7684\u7c7b\u662f\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6b64\u7c7b\u6d41\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u57df\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TruthfulRAG: KG-based framework to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems, improving accuracy and reliability.", "motivation": "Existing RAG conflict resolution approaches are fragmented and partial, especially in knowledge-intensive tasks.", "method": "Construct KGs from retrieved content, use query-based graph retrieval, and employ entropy-based filtering to locate conflicting elements.", "result": "TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving RAG system robustness and trustworthiness.", "conclusion": "TruthfulRAG effectively resolves knowledge conflicts in RAG systems by leveraging KGs."}}

To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection.

However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\\% mAP, +0.8\\% NDS, and +1.3\\% average recall on nuScenes.

Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs.

However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk \"repairing\" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6M^2V-UGAD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u72ec\u7acb\u91cd\u5efa\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8054\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u7f13\u89e3\u63d2\u8865\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5f88\u96be\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u201c\u4fee\u590d\u201d\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u63d2\u8865\u504f\u5dee\u5f15\u5165\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f53\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u540c\u65f6\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u6c61\u67d3\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u635f\u5bb3\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u91cd\u5efa\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u3002\u5728\u8054\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7f\u6b63\u5e38\u8282\u70b9\u5360\u636e\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u800c\u5f02\u5e38\u8282\u70b9\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u58f3\u4e0a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u533a\u57df\u4e4b\u5916\u91c7\u6837\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u786c\u8d1f\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9510\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cM^2V-UGAD\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763GAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "M^2V-UGAD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts.

Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs.

Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions.

Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \\texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$).

While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase.

Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u8bf7\u6c42\u65f6\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9690\u542b\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u6ee1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca-\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u7247\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7b54\u6848\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca-\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b54\u6848\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u5176\u7b54\u6848\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines. In aid of the novel framework, MuSc-V2 achieves significant performance improvements: a $\\textbf{+23.7\\%}$ AP gain on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and a $\\textbf{+19.3\\%}$ boost on the Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and even outperforming most few-shot methods.

Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions.

However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u9694\u79bb\u5f00\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f GPT-4 \u548c Llama3\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u524d\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b83\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u540e\u7ecf\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f GPT-4 \u548c Llama3\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u524d\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b83\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u540e\u7ecf\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f GPT-4 \u548c Llama3\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u524d\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b83\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u540e\u7ecf\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning.

They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted. Extensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including both image and tabular data, validate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u9608\u503c\u89c6\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4ece\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u5173\u952e\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u9608\u503c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e00\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u9608\u503c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u9608\u503c\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u9608\u503c\u89c6\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u8be5\u9608\u503c\u975e\u5e38\u654f\u611f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u6001\u9608\u503c\u662f\u5426\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u9608\u503c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u9608\u503c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e00\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u3002"}}

Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "LocalBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u53bf\u7ea7\u5730\u65b9\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u793e\u533a\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6587\u5316\u53d9\u4e8b\u548c\u5730\u65b9\u6cbb\u7406\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "LocalBench\u5305\u542b\u6765\u81ea\u7f8e\u56fd49\u4e2a\u5dde526\u4e2a\u53bf\u768414,782\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u5f53\u5730subreddit\u8ba8\u8bba\u548c\u533a\u57df\u65b0\u95fb\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d9\u4e8b\u98ce\u683c\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4ec5\u8fbe\u523056.8%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4f4e\u4e8e15.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u5177\u6709\u5730\u57df\u610f\u8bc6\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}
