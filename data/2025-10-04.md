### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个概念学习任务数据集，用于揭示大型语言模型中的隐性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现，语言模型在量词方面可能存在向上单调性的偏差；当模型在没有概念学习组件的情况下进行直接提示测试时，这种偏差不太明显。这表明上下文概念学习是发现语言模型中隐藏偏差的有效方法。

Method: 使用上下文概念学习实验。

Result: 发现语言模型在量词方面可能存在向上单调性的偏差。

Conclusion: 上下文概念学习是发现语言模型中隐藏偏差的有效方法。

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文倡导一种范式转变，即通过对话动态学习新语言，而不是静态数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言的自然语言处理受到文本语料库、标准化正字法和可扩展注释管道的缺乏的限制。大型语言模型的进步虽然改善了跨语言迁移，但由于它们依赖于海量预收集数据和集中式基础设施，因此对于代表性不足的社区来说仍然难以获得。

Method: 提出了一种基于人机联合不确定性的框架，该框架结合了来自模型的认知不确定性以及来自人类说话者的犹豫线索和置信度信号，以指导交互、查询选择和记忆保留。

Result: 本文是一项行动呼吁：我们提倡重新思考人工智能如何与未充分记录的语言中的人类知识互动，从提取式数据收集转向参与式、协同适应的学习过程，尊重和增强社区的能力，同时发现和保护世界的语言多样性。

Conclusion: 人工智能应与人类合作，进行交互式的模型构建，从而尊重和增强社区的能力，同时发现和保护世界的语言多样性。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文利用大型语言模型评估了美国上市公司的气候信息披露成熟度，发现披露内容与实际减排目标脱节，且企业间存在模仿行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化对企业气候信息披露的透明度和可比性提出了更高要求，但模仿和象征性报告降低了其价值。

Method: 使用大型语言模型，构建了四个分类器（情感、承诺、特异性和目标雄心）从可持续性和年度报告中提取叙述性指标，并将其与企业属性联系起来。

Result: 发现风险导向的叙述与明确承诺相关，但量化目标与语气脱节；规模较大和排放较高的公司披露了更多承诺和行动，但与量化目标不一致；披露风格的广泛相似性表明存在模仿行为。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了大型语言模型在ESG叙事分析中的价值，以及加强监管以将承诺与可验证的转型策略联系起来的必要性。

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种兽医专用的大型语言模型（LLM）摘要工具在兽医肿瘤记录数据集上的性能，发现Product 1表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在兽医学中的应用，特别是评估其在兽医临床环境中的性能。

Method: 使用标准化的兽医肿瘤记录数据集，通过LLM-as-a-judge框架，在事实准确性、完整性、时间顺序、临床相关性和组织性五个方面对摘要进行评分。

Result: Product 1的总体表现最佳，事实准确性和时间顺序方面均获得完美的中位数评分。LLM评分器具有很高的可重复性。

Conclusion: 兽医专用LLM工具非常重要，LLM-as-a-judge评估是评估兽医学临床NLP摘要的可扩展和可重复的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck是一个使用小型语言模型和实时网络证据的自动事实核查系统，它通过模仿人类的事实核查流程来实现高准确率和可解释性，同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统依赖大型闭源模型和静态知识库，计算成本高昂且透明度不足。

Method: ClaimCheck采用透明的、分步骤的验证流程，包括网络搜索查询规划、网络证据检索与总结、证据合成与重新检索以及声明判决评估，并针对小型LLM进行了优化。

Result: ClaimCheck使用小型Qwen3-4B模型在AVeriTeC数据集上达到了76.4%的state-of-the-art准确率，超过了使用LLaMA3.1 70B和GPT-4o的先前方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的模块化设计和prompt策略可以克服小型LLM的局限性，ClaimCheck提供了一个公开demo以提高可访问性和透明度。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在数学基准测试中表现出色，但可能存在数据污染和问题类型狭窄的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当前基准测试是否能真实反映LLM的数学推理能力，并解决现有基准测试的局限性。

Method: 引入名为EEFSUVA的新基准测试，该基准测试来自东欧和前苏联的区域和国家奥林匹克竞赛，这些竞赛的题目难度与IMO相当，但在线语料库中不太常见。

Result: 即使是最先进的LLM，在EEFSUVA上的表现也明显低于其他奥林匹克风格的基准测试。

Conclusion: 更广泛的评估数据集对于全面评估数学推理和指导未来的模型开发至关重要。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型应遵循分层指令，但它们经常忽略系统提示覆盖用户输入这一规则，而强烈服从社会线索。通过线性探测、logit 归因和steering实验，研究发现冲突决策信号编码较早，系统-用户和社会冲突形成不同的子空间。系统-用户情况下的内部冲突检测更强，但只有社会线索才能实现一致的解决。尽管使用了社会线索，这些向量却以角色无关的方式放大了指令的执行。这些结果解释了脆弱的系统服从性，并强调了轻量级层次敏感对齐方法的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在遵循分层指令时存在问题，尤其是在系统提示和用户输入冲突的情况下。

Method: 线性探测、直接 Logit 归因、Steering实验

Result: 冲突决策信号编码较早，系统-用户和社会冲突形成不同的子空间。系统-用户情况下的内部冲突检测更强，但只有社会线索才能实现一致的解决。社会线索以角色无关的方式放大了指令的执行。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型存在脆弱的系统服从性，需要轻量级层次敏感对齐方法。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的文档重排序流程，该流程无需人工标注数据，而是使用大型语言模型 (LLM) 生成合成查询，并使用基于 LLM 的分类器来标记正例和难负例，然后使用该合成数据集来微调一个较小的 transformer 模型，并通过对比学习和 LCE 损失来提高重排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 擅长重排序，但计算成本高，微调较小的、特定于任务的模型虽然更有效，但通常依赖于稀缺的手动标记数据。

Method: 使用 LLM 从特定领域的语料库生成合成查询，并使用基于 LLM 的分类器来标记正例和难负例，然后使用该合成数据集来微调一个较小的 transformer 模型，并通过对比学习和 LCE 损失来进行对比学习。

Result: 在 MedQuAD 数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了领域内性能，并且很好地推广到领域外任务。

Conclusion: 通过使用 LLM 进行数据生成和监督而不是推理，我们降低了计算成本，同时保持了强大的重排序能力。

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用PHATE流形分析系统地研究了汉字嵌入中的几何模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过对七个嵌入模型和八个降维方法的交叉验证，我们观察到内容词的聚类模式和功能词的分支模式。对12个语义领域的1000多个汉字的分析表明，几何复杂性与语义内容相关：有意义的字符表现出丰富的几何多样性，而结构部首则坍缩成紧密的簇。

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析

Result: 有意义的字符表现出丰富的几何多样性，而结构部首则坍缩成紧密的簇。全面的儿童网络分析（123个短语）表明了从基本字符进行的系统语义扩展。

Conclusion: 这些发现为传统语言理论提供了计算证据，并为语义组织的几何分析建立了一个新的框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [10] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究关注高风险场景下自动摘要的可靠性，并提出了一个结合不确定性量化和风险意识机制的大型语言模型框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对信息过载和高风险决策的需求，旨在提高自动摘要在高风险场景下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Method: 构建了一个基于条件生成的摘要模型，并在生成过程中引入贝叶斯推断来建模参数空间中的不确定性。使用预测分布熵来衡量生成内容的不确定性水平，并应用熵正则化和风险感知损失的联合优化。

Result: 提出的方法显著提高了摘要在高风险应用中的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持了流畅性和语义完整性。

Conclusion: 本研究为可信摘要提供了一个系统性的解决方案，并在方法论层面展示了可扩展性和实用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

### [11] [Benchmark Profiling: Mechanistic Diagnosis of LLM Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01232)
*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为“基准剖析”的诊断框架，用于分解基准测试的性能，该框架将基准性能分解为十种认知能力，以衡量每种能力对模型在给定基准测试中成功的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型的评估方式（即标准基准测试）存在缺陷，因为它们无法准确反映任务所需的技能组合。我们需要一种系统的方法来验证这些基准测试是否真正衡量了它们所声称的能力。

Method: 该方法结合了基于梯度的重要性评分和有针对性的参数消融，以计算“能力影响分数”（AIS），从而量化每种能力对模型在给定基准测试中成功的影响。

Result: 通过对三个指令调整模型在十个广泛使用的基准测试中进行剖析，得出了四个主要发现：（i）大多数基准测试利用多种能力，而不是一种；（ii）具有相似标签的数据集依赖于不同的能力组合；（iii）代码生成基准测试奖励广泛的多技能改进，因此仅显示了来自狭窄领域特定微调的适度收益；（iv）与任务无关的能力可能会对性能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 基准剖析解释了为什么性能提升并不总是转化为用户感知的能力，并提供了一个透明的工具，用于基准审计和模型可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将传统社区知识与现代计算方法相结合，为分析泰卢固语韵律模式开发了第一个全面的数字框架。

Method: 该方法涉及协作创建包含 4,651 个带注释的 padyam 的数据集、专家验证的语言模式以及具有文化意识的算法设计。该框架包括用于识别音节的 AksharamTokenizer、用于分类轻重音节的 LaghuvuGuruvu Generator 以及用于自动模式识别的 PadyaBhedam Checker。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了计算社会科学如何保护濒危的文化知识系统，同时围绕文学遗产实现新的集体智慧形式。该方法为以社区为中心的文化保护方法提供了见解，支持数字人文和社会意识计算系统中更广泛的举措。

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

*Shubham Agrawal,Prasang Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMRank是一个prompt感知的路由框架，它利用从prompt中提取的丰富的人类可读的特征来预测每个模型的效用，从而选择最合适的模型来优化性能和效率之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部署大型语言模型时，如何在性能和效率之间做出最佳选择是一个挑战。

Method: LLMRank使用一个神经排序模型，该模型在RouterBench上进行训练，RouterBench包含36,497个prompt，涵盖11个基准测试和11个最先进的LLM。该模型利用从prompt中提取的丰富的人类可读的特征，包括任务类型、推理模式、复杂性指标、句法线索以及来自轻量级代理求解器的信号。

Result: LLMRank实现了高达89.2%的oracle效用，并提供可解释的特征归因，解释了路由决策。

Conclusion: LLMRank展示了特征驱动的路由在高效和透明的LLM部署方面的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

*Ivan Leonidovich Litvak,Anton Kostin,Fedor Lashkin,Tatiana Maksiyan,Sergey Lagutin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了16种无监督指标，以评估从1,000个俄语 судебных решений 中提取七个语义块的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在法律自然语言处理中，人工智能的快速发展需要可扩展的方法来评估从司法判决中提取文本的质量。

Method: 使用包括新颖公式在内的 16 个无监督指标，针对 7,168 个专家评审（1-5 Likert 尺度）进行验证，评估从 1,000 个匿名的俄语司法判决中提取的七个语义块的质量。

Result: 结果表明，术语频率一致性（Pearson r = 0.540，Lin CCC = 0.512，MAE = 0.127）和覆盖率/块完整性（Pearson r = 0.513，Lin CCC = 0.443，MAE = 0.139）与专家评分最吻合，而法律术语密度（Pearson r = -0.479，Lin CCC = -0.079，MAE = 0.394）表现出很强的负相关性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，无监督指标（包括基于 LLM 的方法）支持可扩展的筛选，但由于相关性适中且 CCC 值较低，因此无法完全取代高风险法律环境中的人工判断。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

### [16] [Confidence-Aware Routing for Large Language Model Reliability Enhancement: A Multi-Signal Approach to Pre-Generation Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01237)
*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型存在幻觉问题，会生成看似合理但实际上不正确的内容。本文提出了一种置信度感知路由系统，该系统在生成内容之前主动评估模型的不确定性，并根据估计的可靠性重定向查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缓解策略侧重于生成后的校正，这种方法计算成本高昂且无法防止生成不可靠的内容。本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 该方法结合了三个互补信号：内部表示和参考嵌入之间的语义对齐、跨模型层的内部收敛分析以及学习到的置信度估计。统一的置信度分数决定了到四个路径的路由：高置信度的本地生成、中等置信度的检索增强生成、低置信度的大型模型以及非常低置信度的人工审查。

Result: 在知识密集型 QA 基准上的评估表明，幻觉检测方面有显着改进（0.74 vs. 0.42 基线），同时与事后方法相比，计算成本降低了 40%。F1 分数从 0.61 提高到 0.82，且假阳性率较低 (0.09)。

Conclusion: 这种从被动校正到主动评估的范式转变，为增强 LLM 可靠性提供了一种计算效率高的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 填充token在llm中被广泛使用，但实现错误会导致它们影响计算。即使少量的填充也会改变隐藏表示，降低较小模型的质量，以不可预测的方式改变偏差，并削弱安全护栏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究填充token对llm的影响，因为填充token中的实现错误会影响计算。

Method: 在三个开源模型系列（Llama、Gemma、Qwen）中插入受控数量的填充，并评估激活、生成质量、偏差和安全性四个方面的结果。

Result: 即使少量的填充也会改变隐藏表示，降低较小模型的质量，以不可预测的方式改变偏差，并削弱安全护栏。

Conclusion: 填充不是无害的细节，而是一种鲁棒性风险，必须在部署中仔细处理。

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX通过重用主任务的KV缓存并在隔离的侧路径中注入任务特定的指令来减少计算开销，从而实现高效的设备上多任务对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着llm变得越来越强大，单个模型有望处理各种子任务，从而更有效和全面地支持回答用户请求。幼稚的方法在主任务和子任务之间切换时会重新处理整个对话上下文，从而导致大量的计算开销。CIFLEX 缓解了这种开销。

Method: CIFLEX通过重用主任务的key-value (KV)缓存，并将任务特定的指令注入到隔离的侧路径中来缓解这种开销。在子任务执行之后，模型通过缓存的上下文回滚到主路径，从而避免了冗余的预填充计算。为了支持子任务选择，我们还开发了一种为小规模模型量身定制的分层分类策略，将多项选择决策分解为二元选择。

Result: 实验表明，CIFLEX在不降低任务性能的情况下显著降低了计算成本，从而实现了可扩展和高效的设备上多任务对话。

Conclusion: CIFLEX是一种用于在与单个设备上大型语言模型(LLM)的多轮交互中高效处理子任务的新型执行系统。

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

TL;DR: 发布了两个数学基准测试：SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH 和 SKYLENAGE-MATH，用于评估大型语言模型 (LLM) 的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学基准测试存在天花板效应，难以区分 LLM 在数学能力上的差异。

Method: 评估了 15 个 LLM 变体在两个基准测试上的表现，并分析了 subject x model 和 grade x model 的性能。

Result: 在竞赛套件中，最强的模型达到了 44% 的准确率，而亚军达到了 37%；准确率从高中到博士下降，顶级系统的博士到高中的保留率接近 79%。在推理集中，最好的模型总体上达到了 81%，并且最难的切片结果揭示了领导者和中层之间的明显鲁棒性差距。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE 提供了一个以推理为中心且覆盖面广的数学基准，具有校准的难度和丰富的元数据，可作为未来评估数学推理的参考基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [20] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了人工智能通过记忆性能中的结构不对称性表现出老化现象，提出了人工年龄评分（AAS）来衡量这种老化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在会话重置后，语义线索稳定但情景细节崩溃的现象，旨在捕捉并量化人工智能的记忆老化。

Method: 论文提出了人工年龄评分（AAS），这是一个基于信息熵的指标，通过观察回忆行为来评估记忆老化。该方法在ChatGPT-5上进行了为期25天的双语研究，包括无状态和持久性交互阶段。

Result: 在持久性会话中，模型能回忆起语义和情景细节，AAS接近最小值；会话重置后，模型保持语义一致性但情景记忆失败，导致AAS显著增加，表明结构性记忆老化。

Conclusion: 研究表明AAS可以作为评估人工智能系统中记忆退化的理论工具，并与冯·诺依曼、香农和图灵的相关理论联系起来。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

*Yisong Xiao,Aishan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Zonghao Ying,Xianglong Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为ARGRE的新的测试时解毒框架，通过在潜在表示空间中显式建模毒性转换，实现稳定和精确的奖励引导编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对毒性输出和非毒性输出之间的转换空间探索不足，导致干预不精确。

Method: ARGRE通过识别非毒性语义方向并在毒性和非毒性表示之间进行插值来揭示细粒度的转换轨迹，然后构建自回归奖励模型来提供稳定和精确的编辑指导。在推理时，奖励模型指导自适应的两步编辑过程。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的LLM上的大量实验表明，ARGRE在有效性（-62.21%的毒性）和效率（-47.58%的推理时间）方面显著优于领先的基线，同时以最小的退化保留了原始模型的核心能力。

Conclusion: ARGRE框架能够显著降低LLM生成内容的毒性，同时保持模型的核心能力和推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究旨在开发一个心理压力本体，并评估使用大型语言模型（LLM）从叙述性文本中提取本体指导的压力相关信息的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力对健康有显著影响，但通常未被充分报告和记录。环境人工智能技术有希望减轻文档负担，但主要生成非结构化叙述，限制了下游临床效用。

Method: 通过整合压力交易模型等理论模型与11个经过验证的压力评估工具的概念，开发了心理压力本体（MeSO）。使用Claude Sonnet 4从35个Reddit帖子中提取了六类压力相关信息。人工审核员评估了准确性和本体覆盖率。

Result: 最终本体包括八个顶级类别中的181个概念。在220个可提取的压力相关项目中，LLM正确识别了172个（78.2%），错误分类了27个（12.3%），遗漏了21个（9.5%）。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，使用本体指导的LLM进行压力相关信息的结构化提取是可行的，有潜力提高环境人工智能系统中压力文档的一致性和效用。

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以利用描述外部事件的文本信息，导致在预测人类移动时无法应对突变。

Method: 提出SeMob，一个基于LLM的语义合成流程，采用多智能体框架从在线文本中提取和推理时空相关文本，并通过渐进式融合架构将细粒度的相关上下文与时空数据结合。

Result: SeMob在MAE上减少了13.92%，在RMSE上减少了11.12%，尤其在事件发生地附近表现出优越性。

Conclusion: SeMob通过融合LLM提取的事件信息，显著提升了人类移动预测的准确性，尤其是在事件影响区域。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的零样本或即插即用逆解算器LVTINO，用于高清晰度视频恢复，该解算器利用VCMs编码的先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于需要恢复精细的空间细节，同时捕捉微妙的时间依赖性，因此将这些进展扩展到高清晰度视频恢复仍然是一个巨大的挑战。逐帧应用基于图像的LDM先验的方法通常会导致时间上不一致的重建。

Method: 利用视频一致性模型(VCMs)，它将视频潜在扩散模型提炼成快速生成器，明确地捕捉时间因果关系。在此基础上，我们提出了LVTINO。

Result: 在各种视频逆问题上进行的大量实验表明，与当前逐帧应用图像ldm的最新方法相比，在感知上有显著的改进，在重建保真度和计算效率方面都建立了一个新的基准。

Conclusion: LVTINO是第一个具有vcm编码先验的高清视频修复的零样本或即插即用逆解算器。

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 在自然语言中，细粒度的风格无法精确描述和控制，而风格化参考图像的引导信息难以与传统文本引导生成的文本条件直接对齐。

Method: 提出了一种三阶段训练的基于风格提取的图像生成方法，该方法使用风格编码器和风格投影层来对齐风格表示和文本表示，以实现基于细粒度文本提示的风格引导生成。构建了 Style30k-captions 数据集，其样本包含图像、风格标签和文本描述的三元组，以训练风格编码器和风格投影层。

Result: 实现了细粒度控制的风格化图像生成。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地从参考图像中提取风格信息，并将其用于图像生成，从而实现对生成图像风格的精确控制。

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的操作数据集没有关注挣扎如何随时间演变，而理解这种演变对于确定用户的当前学习阶段至关重要。

Method: 收集了一个包含61.68小时视频记录、2,793个视频和5,385个带注释的时间挣扎片段的数据集，这些数据来自76名参与者。数据集包括18个任务，分为四个不同的活动，参与者重复相同的任务五次以捕捉他们的技能演变。将挣扎确定问题定义为时间行为定位任务。

Result: 时间行为定位模型可以成功学习检测挣扎线索，即使在未见过的任务或活动中进行评估。当跨任务泛化时，模型达到34.56%的平均mAP，当跨活动泛化时，模型达到19.24%的平均mAP。

Conclusion: 挣扎是各种基于技能的任务中可转移的概念，但仍然对挣扎检测的进一步改进提出了挑战。

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏微分方程基础模型主要基于大型复杂Transformer架构，计算和参数开销高昂。SPUS利用轻量级残差U-Net架构，这种架构在该领域作为基础模型架构尚未得到充分探索。

Method: SPUS采用一种简单而强大的自回归预训练策略，紧密复制数值求解器的行为来学习底层物理。

Result: SPUS在各种物理系统的6个具有挑战性的未见下游偏微分方程上进行了评估，实现了最先进的泛化性能，同时需要的参数明显更少，微调数据也最少。

Conclusion: SPUS具有作为解决各种偏微分方程系统的高参数效率基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

Method: DisCo通过Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) 微调流动匹配模型，使用组合奖励来惩罚图像内面部相似性、抑制交叉样本身份重复、强制执行准确的人数，并通过人类偏好分数保持视觉保真度。

Result: 在DiverseHumans测试集上，DisCo实现了98.6%的Unique Face Accuracy和接近完美的Global Identity Spread，超越了开源和专有方法，同时保持了竞争力的感知质量。

Conclusion: DisCo是一个可扩展、无注释的解决方案，解决了生成模型中长期存在的身份危机，并为组合多人类生成树立了新的基准。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的视觉地理定位方法，该方法通过将查询图像的视觉表示与学习到的地理表示对齐来实现地理定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉地理定位方法在学习地理表示方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 该方法将世界建模为地理嵌入的层次结构，并融合了查询图像的外观特征和语义分割图。

Result: 该方法在五个基准数据集的 25 个指标中的 22 个指标上，都取得了优于现有技术水平 (SOTA) 方法和最近的大型视觉-语言模型 (LVLM) 的效果。

Conclusion: 地理表示和视觉表示的结合是性能提升的主要驱动因素。

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据高效的指令微调LVLM方法，可以在不损失性能的情况下减少训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在LVLM上表现不佳，无法超越随机选择。

Method: 提出XMAS方法，该方法基于跨模态注意力矩阵的相似性对样本进行聚类，并从这些聚类中采样平衡的子集。

Result: XMAS可以在保留LLaVA-1.5-7B性能的同时，减少50%的LLaVA-665k数据集和85%的Vision-Flan数据集，并加速1.2倍的训练速度。

Conclusion: XMAS是一种有效的数据高效LVLM指令微调方法，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

TL;DR: Purrception是一种结合连续传输动态和离散类别监督的向量量化图像生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高图像生成的训练效率。

Method: 通过学习类别后验概率和在连续嵌入空间中计算速度场，将变分流匹配调整为向量量化潜在空间。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k 256x256生成任务上，Purrception的训练收敛速度比连续流匹配和离散流匹配基线更快，并且实现了与最先进模型相媲美的FID分数。

Conclusion: 变分流匹配可以有效地桥接连续传输和离散监督，从而提高图像生成的训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于从非对比CT扫描生成合成CECT图像的统一深度学习框架，同时分割主动脉腔和血栓，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对比增强CT(CECT)中碘化对比剂的使用，因为它们具有肾毒性、患者过敏和环境危害等风险。

Method: 集成了条件扩散模型(CDM)与多任务学习，实现图像合成和解剖分割的端到端联合优化。该方法不需要初始预测，跨任务共享编码器和解码器参数，并采用半监督训练策略。

Result: 在264名患者的队列中，该模型在图像合成和解剖分割方面均优于现有技术。图像合成的PSNR为25.61 dB，腔Dice评分为0.89，血栓Dice评分为0.53。临床测量更加准确。

Conclusion: 该方法在生成合成CECT图像和分割主动脉腔和血栓方面均具有优越性，并减少了临床测量误差。

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

TL;DR: 提出一个用于多模态内容分析的框架，能够高效地将视频转换为可查询的知识图谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态内容分析计算量大，工程量大，将预训练模型与视频等复杂数据融合具有挑战性。

Method: 设计一个流程，结合一组预训练模型，将视频转换为时间半结构化数据格式，然后将其转换为帧级别索引的知识图谱表示。

Result: 该框架支持可查询和持续学习，能够通过交互式媒介动态地整合新的领域知识。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效地原型化多模态内容分析的pipeline。

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为WALT的Web代理框架，通过逆向工程将网站功能转化为可重用的工具，以实现更稳健和通用的浏览器自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Web代理方法依赖于逐步UI交互和重度LLM推理，在动态布局和长周期下容易失效。人类则通过搜索、过滤和排序等高级操作来利用网站提供的功能。

Method: WALT框架逆向工程潜在的网站功能，将其转化为可重用的可调用工具，涵盖发现、通信和内容管理。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena上，WALT以更少的步骤和更少的LLM依赖实现了更高的成功率。

Conclusion: WALT为浏览器自动化建立了一个稳健和通用的范例。

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

Conclusion: 该方法有效地减少了拓扑错误，从而产生了更强大，更准确的分割，这对于可靠的下游分析至关重要。

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型主要依赖成对偏好进行优化，而忽略了人类反馈中更精确的列表式偏好信息。

Method: 提出了 Diffusion-LPO 框架，通过 Plackett-Luce 模型扩展了 DPO 目标，并在整个排序中保持一致性。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、图像编辑和个性化偏好对齐等任务中，Diffusion-LPO 始终优于成对 DPO 基线。

Conclusion: Diffusion-LPO 能够有效提升视觉质量和偏好对齐效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

Motivation: 构建同时支持理解和生成能力的统一多模态大语言模型仍然具有挑战性，现有的混合方法打破了自回归范式，而纯自回归方法在语义对齐和像素级保真度之间面临权衡。

Method: 提出了Bridge模型，使用混合Transformer架构，并提出了语义到像素的离散表示，集成了紧凑的语义tokens和细粒度的像素tokens。

Result: Bridge在多种多模态基准测试中取得了有竞争力的或更优越的结果。

Conclusion: Bridge在理解和生成任务上表现出色，同时比以前的统一MLLM需要更少的训练数据和更短的训练时间。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型依赖于点估计，导致过度自信和可靠性降低，并且需要大型数据集，这在训练数据有限的情况下是不现实的。

Result: 在与训练数据分布相似的测试数据集上，该方法达到了 94% 的准确率，与传统 CNN 的性能相当。对于真实世界的摄影图像数据，该模型表现出更好的泛化性，在不同数据集上达到了 88% 的准确率，而传统 CNN 的准确率为 72.94%。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯推理在数据稀缺环境中通过提高模型可靠性和泛化性，在增强早期口腔癌诊断方面是有效的。

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

Conclusion: CADTrans通过构建不变特征表示和对齐困难样本，在源域无关领域自适应方面取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究表明，利用历史用户提问可以有效提升多模态大语言模型生成描述的针对性和有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

*Zijun Li,Jinchang Zhang,Ming Zhang,Guoyu Lu*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动基因组解释模块，该模块将原始DNA序列转化为可操作、可解释的决策，适用于整合到医疗自动化和机器人系统中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将可解释的基因组模型与自动化决策相结合，为基因组医学中的机器人和临床自动化奠定可靠的基础。

Method: 该框架结合了混沌博弈表示（CGR）与概念瓶颈模型（CBM），通过生物学上有意义的概念（如GC含量、CpG密度和k-mer基序）来强制预测。为了提高可靠性，我们结合了概念保真度监督、先验一致性对齐、KL分布匹配和不确定性校准。

Result: 该模块不仅能够准确分类内部和LANL数据集中的HIV亚型，而且还提供可解释的证据，可以直接针对生物学先验进行验证。与现有基线相比，该系统在分类性能、概念预测保真度和成本效益方面均表现出色。

Conclusion: 该研究通过弥合可解释的基因组建模和自动化决策之间的差距，为基因组医学中的机器人和临床自动化奠定了可靠的基础。

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation
in genomic medicine.

*Angen Ye,Zeyu Zhang,Boyuan Wang,Xiaofeng Wang,Dapeng Zhang,Zheng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-R1模型通过强化学习和可验证奖励，提升了视觉-语言-动作模型的推理和执行能力，并提出了一个高质量的CoT数据集VLA-CoT-13K。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型缺乏明确的逐步推理，忽略了可供性和几何关系约束，并且后训练流程很少加强推理质量。

Method: 提出了VLA-R1，它结合了基于可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）和群相对策略优化（GRPO），以系统地优化推理和执行。设计了一个基于RLVR的后训练策略，具有区域对齐、轨迹一致性和输出格式的可验证奖励。构建了高质量数据集VLA-CoT-13K。

Result: VLA-R1在领域内、领域外、模拟和真实机器人平台上的广泛评估表明，与先前的VLA方法相比，VLA-R1实现了卓越的泛化和实际性能。

Conclusion: VLA-R1通过强化推理和执行，并在多个平台上的验证，证明了其优越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于微距摄影的联合去模糊和3D重建方法，仅需少量多视角图像即可实现高质量图像去模糊和高保真3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微距镜头具有高分辨率和高放大倍数的优点，对小型和细节物体进行3D建模可以提供更丰富的信息。然而，微距摄影中的散焦模糊是一个长期存在的问题，严重阻碍了捕获物体的清晰成像和高质量的3D重建。

Method: 从捕获的多视角模糊图像出发，联合优化物体的清晰3D模型和每个像素的散焦模糊核。整个框架采用可微渲染方法来对3D模型和散焦模糊核的优化进行自监督。

Result: 大量实验表明，从少量的多视角图像中，该方法不仅可以实现高质量的图像去模糊，而且可以恢复高保真度的3D外观。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了微距摄影中散焦模糊的问题，并实现了高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Motivation: 使用闭源API进行OR任务存在隐私问题，从头开始训练开源模型计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用半自动数据合成管道生成多样的OR问题-答案对，并用外部求解器增强模型以产生API调用，对Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct进行微调。

Result: 在四个标准基准测试中的三个上，OR-Toolformer实现了高达80.1%的执行准确率，超过了同等规模的基线模型4.3%以上。在两种未见过的OR问题类型上的零样本评估中，它获得了54%的平均准确率，比最强的基线模型提高了21个百分点。

Conclusion: 研究结果验证了工具增强的微调LLM在准确和通用的OR问题建模和解决方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer
pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On
three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a
21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings
validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and
generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类建模方法通常需要大量数据且脆弱，因为它们要么对理性做出不切实际的假设，要么计算量太大而无法快速适应。本文的关键见解是，许多日常社交互动可能遵循可预测的模式；高效的“脚本”可以最大限度地减少参与者和观察者的认知负荷。

Method: 本文将这些例程建模为在计算机代码中实例化的行为程序，而不是以信念和愿望为条件的策略。本文介绍了一种名为 ROTE 的新算法，该算法利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 合成行为程序的假设空间，并利用概率推理来推断该空间的不确定性。

Result: ROTE 在一组网格世界任务和一个大型具身家庭模拟器中进行了测试。ROTE 可以根据稀疏的观察结果预测人类和 AI 行为，在样本内准确性和样本外泛化方面，其性能优于竞争基线（包括行为克隆和基于 LLM 的方法）高达 50%。

Conclusion: 通过将动作理解视为一个程序综合问题，ROTE 为 AI 系统高效有效地预测现实世界中的人类行为开辟了一条道路。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Motivation: 现有AI系统在跨学科协作和探索未知问题方面存在局限性。

Method: 通过整合领域知识库、知识增强技术和协作智能体，构建了一个智能生态系统。

Result: 知识库增强机制平均提高了所有七个专家智能体10-15%的对话质量得分；协作智能体使远领域专家对的协作效率提高了8.5%，而近领域专家对仅提高了0.8%。

Conclusion: 精心设计的多智能体架构可以为化学工程领域的自主科学发现提供可行的途径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的评估基准无法捕捉到智能体在交互环境中涌现的社会和认知动态。

Method: 使用多智能体辩论，LLM智能体被赋予不同的人物角色和激励机制，在LLM主持人的监督下，就各种具有挑战性的话题进行辩论。通过一套新的心理测量和语义指标进行分析。

Result: 发现智能体具有寻求共识的强大且稳健的倾向，即使没有明确的指示，也能始终达到高度的语义一致性。分配的人物角色可以诱导出稳定的、可测量的心理测量特征，尤其是在认知努力方面。主持人的角色可以通过构建环境来显着改变辩论结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为一类新的、动态的、基于心理测量的评估协议提供了一个蓝图，该协议专为智能体环境而设计，为理解和塑造下一代AI智能体的社会行为提供了一个关键方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

Motivation: 现有VLMs在拼图任务上表现不佳，表明其感知和推理能力有限；高质量视觉语言数据稀缺且可扩展性有限。

Method: 提出AGILE，将拼图游戏解决过程形式化为交互过程，模型生成可执行代码来执行动作，环境提供细粒度视觉反馈。

Conclusion: AGILE为提升多模态模型的推理和泛化能力开辟了新途径，并为多模态强化学习数据的稀缺性提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在对话实例中的上下文和记忆基准测试，但评估动态企业环境中的记忆对于其有效应用至关重要。

Method: 通过集成Slack、Linear和Git等多个通信和生产力平台的异步事件，MEMTRACK模拟了真实的组织工作流程。该基准测试提供了一个按时间顺序排列的平台交叉时间线，包含嘈杂、冲突和交叉引用的信息，以及潜在的代码库/文件系统理解和探索。

Result: 在最先进的LLM和记忆后端上进行的实验表明，在长时程内利用记忆、处理跨平台依赖关系和解决矛盾方面存在挑战。性能最佳的GPT-5模型在MEMTRACK上的正确率仅为60%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进记忆增强代理的评估研究提供了一个可扩展的框架，超越了现有对会话设置的关注，并为复杂组织环境中的多代理、多平台记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策日益复杂，电子健康记录（EHR）快速扩展，为数据驱动的医疗保健带来机遇和挑战。

Method: 该系统通过分析历史EHR数据，整合自然语言处理和结构化临床输入，利用检索增强生成（RAG）流水线，产生上下文相关的治疗建议。

Result: 初步评估表明，基于LLM的工具在处方工作流程中可能提供有价值的决策支持。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了将生成式人工智能整合到实际临床决策中的初步尝试，重点在于透明度、安全性和与既定实践的一致性。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TRACE的新方法，用于检测推理模型中隐式的奖励篡改行为，这种行为利用奖励函数的漏洞来获得高奖励，而无需解决预期任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励篡改对模型构成重大威胁，尤其是在隐式篡改的情况下，传统的CoT监控方法难以有效检测。

Method: 通过逐步截断模型的CoT，并测量验证器通过率来量化模型所需的努力程度。篡改模型通常只需CoT的一小部分即可实现高通过率。

Result: TRACE在数学推理方面比最强的72B CoT监控器提升了超过65%，在编码方面比32B监控器提升了超过30%。TRACE还可以发现训练期间未知的漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种可扩展的无监督方法，用于监督当前监控方法无效的情况。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在多步骤任务中表现不佳，通过将推理时检索转化为学习能力来解决这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在多步骤任务中经常失败，例如尝试执行未满足前提条件的操作、发布冗余命令或错误处理环境约束。检索增强生成（RAG）虽然可以通过提供运行时指导来提高性能，但需要维护外部知识数据库，并在每次部署时增加计算开销。

Method: 该方法包括：(1) 从agent失败中提取简洁、可重用的提示；(2) 使用这些提示，通过在episode开始时进行一次性检索来生成改进的教师轨迹；(3) 在删除提示字符串的情况下，在这些轨迹上训练学生模型，从而强制进行内部化而不是记忆。

Result: 在两个交互式基准测试ALFWorld和WebShop中，经过提炼的学生模型始终优于基线agent，在ALFWorld上实现了高达91%的成功率（基线为79%），并将WebShop的分数提高到72（基线为61），同时比检索增强教师使用的token减少了10-60%，具体取决于环境。

Conclusion: 该方法可以推广到不同的模型规模（7B/14B参数）和agent架构（ReAct/StateAct），表明检索优势可以通过有针对性的微调有效地内部化，而无需永久的运行时依赖性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures

internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用大型语言模型（LLM）代理来自动化数据驱动建模和分析的创新流程，特别关注回归任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据驱动方法需要大量的人工干预，限制了它们有效扩展和泛化到不同应用的能力。现代工程越来越依赖于实验和模拟产生的大型数据集，因此越来越需要高效、可靠和广泛适用的建模策略。

Method: 该研究评估了两种LLM代理框架：一种是具有专业协作代理的多代理系统，另一种是基于推理和行动（ReAct）范例的单代理系统。这两个框架都可以自动处理数据预处理、神经网络开发、训练、超参数优化和不确定性量化（UQ）。

Result: 结果表明，该LLM代理开发的模型超越了传统的CHF查找表，并提供了与人类专家开发的基于贝叶斯优化的最先进的深度神经网络模型相当的预测精度和UQ。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了基于LLM的代理在自动化复杂工程建模任务方面的巨大潜力，大大减少了人类的工作量，同时满足或超过了现有预测性能标准。

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为OntoLogX的自主人工智能代理，它利用大型语言模型将原始日志转换为基于本体的知识图谱，从而提取可操作的网络威胁情报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从日志中提取可操作的网络威胁情报面临结构缺失、语义不一致和碎片化等挑战。

Method: OntoLogX集成了轻量级日志本体与检索增强生成（RAG）和迭代修正步骤，以确保生成的知识图谱在句法和语义上有效。此外，该系统将知识图谱聚合到会话中，并使用大型语言模型来预测MITRE ATT&CK策略。

Result: 在公共基准和真实蜜罐数据集上的评估表明，OntoLogX能够生成稳健的知识图谱，并将对抗活动准确地映射到ATT&CK策略。

Conclusion: 结果强调了检索和修正对精度和召回率的好处，代码导向模型在结构化日志分析中的有效性，以及基于本体的表示对于可操作的CTI提取的价值。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

TL;DR: Falconer是一个结合LLM和轻量级代理模型的可扩展知识挖掘框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模部署LLM成本高昂，传统 pipeline 难以泛化到新任务。

Method: LLM作为规划者，将用户指令分解为可执行的 pipeline；LLM作为注释者，生成监督信号来训练小型代理模型。

Result: Falconer在指令跟随精度上与 SOTA LLM 接近，同时降低了高达 90% 的推理成本，并将大规模知识挖掘加速了 20 倍以上。

Conclusion: Falconer为深度研究提供了一个高效且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VOGUE通过将图像视为随机上下文，量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，利用不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样计划来平衡探索和利用，从而提升多模态LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉输入视为固定的确定性条件，忽略了歧义的关键来源，并且难以构建对合理的视觉变化具有鲁棒性的策略。因此，论文旨在解决多模态LLM在探索方面的难题。

Method: 提出VOGUE，一种新颖的方法，将探索从输出（文本）转移到输入（视觉）空间。该方法通过量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，创建直接的信号来进行不确定性感知探索。

Result: 在两个模型规模（Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B）上实施，VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准测试中平均提高了2.6%的pass@1准确率，在三个通用领域推理基准测试中平均提高了3.7%的pass@1准确率，同时提高了pass@4性能，并减轻了RL微调中常见的探索衰减。

Conclusion: 将探索建立在视觉输入固有的不确定性中，是提高多模态推理的有效策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

### [62] [Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts Surpasses ToT by Incorporating Logically-Consistent, Low-Utility Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01500)
*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT) mitigates breadth saturation and depth myopia in Tree-of-Thoughts search by separating utility from consistency, treating consistent but low-utility candidates as assets. It uses Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC) to explore these candidates with short, cheap probes and promotes them when they meet the mainline utility bar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Tree-of-Thoughts search suffers from breadth saturation and depth myopia under large test-time compute budgets.

Method: LToT splits the search frontier into mainlines (high-utility) and laterals (consistent, low-utility). It explores laterals using LR--SC, a capped successive-halving race with width-aware thresholds and repeat-to-confirm, promoting branches that exceed the mainline utility. Mainlines are kept narrow to invest compute in laterals.

Result: LToT achieves pseudolinear lateral cost  Θ(N_0 log_η N_0). Empirical evaluations are in preparation.

Conclusion: LToT effectively utilizes large test-time budgets by promoting diversity and maintaining promotion discipline, thus mitigating saturation and myopia without increasing compute.

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

Motivation: 研究动机是平衡LLM在数学推理任务中的利用和探索，以提高准确性。

Method: 该方法首先训练一个SAE来生成稀疏向量表示，然后应用k-means聚类构建图，顶点代表token集群，加权边捕获连续token转换。使用该图定义基于边权重的奖励函数，以量化对已建立的推理轨迹的坚持程度，从而识别利用性推理轨迹。此外，通过聚类测量生成多样性以评估探索程度。

Result: 研究结果表明，平衡利用和探索对于在数学推理任务中实现高准确性至关重要。

Conclusion: SAE可以作为可扩展的奖励模型来指导生成，确保利用和探索之间的平衡，防止极端行为，最终促进LLM中更高质量的推理过程。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

Motivation: 高保证推理需要准确、可验证且明确基于证据的结论。由于存在大量例外情况，这种推理依赖于从规则、法规和合同中编纂的前提，本质上涉及可撤销或非单调逻辑，其中引入单个事实会使一般规则失效，从而带来重大挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为 LOGicalThought (LogT) 的新型神经符号基础架构，该架构使用高级逻辑语言和推理器以及 LLM 来构建双重符号图上下文和基于逻辑的上下文。

Result: 在四个多域基准上针对四个基线进行评估，LogT 将所有 LLM 的整体性能提高了 11.84%。在所有三种推理模式下，性能均显着提高：与最强基线相比，否定高达 +10.2%，蕴涵高达 +13.2%，可撤销推理高达 +5.5%。

Conclusion: LogT 是一种很有前途的用于高保证推理的架构，它能够有效地处理否定、蕴涵和可撤销推理。

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

TL;DR: InfoSeeker: An LLM decision-making framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM planning agents often overlook discrepancies between their internal dynamics and the actual environment.

Method: InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding, detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising task-oriented plans.

Result: InfoSeeker achieves a 74% absolute performance gain over prior methods and generalizes across LLMs.

Conclusion: Tightly integrating planning and information seeking is important for robust behavior in partially observable environments.

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在训练dLLM进行复杂推理时，依赖于稀疏的、基于结果的奖励，这可能导致模型学习到错误的推理路径。

Method: 提出了一个理论框架，将复杂问题求解形式化为分层选择过程，并将不可解的全局约束分解为一系列更简单的、局部化的逻辑步骤。基于此，提出了Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO) 算法，该算法使用基于过程的奖励函数，鼓励增量进步，引导模型学习结构化的、连贯的推理路径。

Result: SAPO算法在具有挑战性的推理基准测试中显著提高了性能，并增强了生成过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的理论框架和SAPO算法能够有效提升dLLM在复杂推理任务中的表现，并提高模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全对齐方法直接优化安全回应，而InvThink则另辟蹊径，指示模型列举潜在危害，分析其后果，并生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。

Method: 通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM家族中实施InvThink。

Result: InvThink在模型尺寸扩大时，安全性提升效果优于现有方法，缓解了安全税，并在高风险领域表现出色，与SafetyPrompt等基线方法相比，有害回应减少了高达15.7%。

Conclusion: 反向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了一条可扩展且通用的路径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

TL;DR: QuintoAndar Group, Latin America's largest housing platform, uses location to improve housing recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users struggle to find the ideal home due to the large number of houses available and the importance of location in determining property value, access to amenities, and life quality.

Method: A geo-aware embedding framework is proposed, integrating an hierarchical H3 grid at multiple levels into a two-tower neural architecture.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates richer and more balanced embedding representations and a substantial uplift in recommendation quality compared to a traditional matrix factorization baseline and a single-resolution variant.

Conclusion: Incorporating location into recommendations is essential for their effectiveness, and the proposed geo-aware embedding framework addresses sparsity and spatial nuances in housing recommendations.

Abstract: QuintoAndar Group is Latin America's largest housing platform,
revolutionizing property rentals and sales. Headquartered in Brazil, it
simplifies the housing process by eliminating paperwork and enhancing
accessibility for tenants, buyers, and landlords. With thousands of houses
available for each city, users struggle to find the ideal home. In this
context, location plays a pivotal role, as it significantly influences property
value, access to amenities, and life quality. A great location can make even a
modest home highly desirable. Therefore, incorporating location into
recommendations is essential for their effectiveness. We propose a geo-aware
embedding framework to address sparsity and spatial nuances in housing
recommendations on digital rental platforms. Our approach integrates an
hierarchical H3 grid at multiple levels into a two-tower neural architecture.
We compare our method with a traditional matrix factorization baseline and a
single-resolution variant using interaction data from our platform. Embedding
specific evaluation reveals richer and more balanced embedding representations,
while offline ranking simulations demonstrate a substantial uplift in
recommendation quality.

Motivation: 在错误信息泛滥的时代，可靠数据的可访问性至关重要。国家统计机构提供大量数据，但数据分散且难以处理，因此本研究旨在探索利用 LLM 自动生成图表以提高数据可访问性的潜力。

Method: 研究人员使用荷兰统计局的公共数据，评估了多个 LLM 在识别相关数据表、执行必要操作以及自主生成适当可视化方面的能力。他们提出了一个新的评估框架，涵盖数据检索与预处理、代码质量和视觉表示三个维度。

Result: 结果表明，定位和处理正确的数据是最重要的挑战。在没有明确指导的情况下，LLM 很少实现可视化最佳实践。当补充了有关有效图表设计的信息后，模型在表示分数上表现出显着提高。此外，具有迭代自我评估的代理方法在所有评估维度上均表现出色。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，可以通过适当的脚手架和反馈机制来提高 LLM 在自动图表生成方面的有效性，并且系统已经可以在三个评估维度上达到必要的准确性。

Abstract: In this time when biased information, deep fakes, and propaganda proliferate,
the accessibility of reliable data sources is more important than ever.
National statistical institutes provide curated data that contain quantitative
information on a wide range of topics. However, that information is typically
spread across many tables and the plain numbers may be arduous to process.
Hence, this open data may be practically inaccessible. We ask the question "Are
current Generative AI models capable of facilitating the identification of the
right data and the fully-automatic creation of charts to provide information in
visual form, corresponding to user queries?". We present a structured
evaluation of recent large language models' (LLMs) capabilities to generate
charts from complex data in response to user queries. Working with diverse
public data from Statistics Netherlands, we assessed multiple LLMs on their
ability to identify relevant data tables, perform necessary manipulations, and
generate appropriate visualizations autonomously. We propose a new evaluation
framework spanning three dimensions: data retrieval & pre-processing, code
quality, and visual representation. Results indicate that locating and
processing the correct data represents the most significant challenge.
Additionally, LLMs rarely implement visualization best practices without
explicit guidance. When supplemented with information about effective chart
design, models showed marked improvement in representation scores. Furthermore,
an agentic approach with iterative self-evaluation led to excellent performance
across all evaluation dimensions. These findings suggest that LLMs'
effectiveness for automated chart generation can be enhanced through
appropriate scaffolding and feedback mechanisms, and that systems can already
reach the necessary accuracy across the three evaluation dimensions.

TL;DR: MetaSynth是一个多代理检索增强生成框架，通过学习隐式搜索反馈来优化元标题和描述，从而提高点击率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化搜索和推荐平台中的元标题和描述仍然具有挑战性，因为缺乏显式标签和黑盒环境。

Method: MetaSynth构建一个从排名靠前结果中提取的示例库，生成基于产品内容和示例的候选片段，并通过评估器-生成器循环迭代改进输出，以确保相关性、促销强度和合规性。

Result: 在专有的电子商务数据和Amazon Reviews语料库上，MetaSynth优于强大的基线，并且大规模A/B测试表明点击率提高了10.26%，点击量提高了7.51%。

Conclusion: 这项工作贡献了一种通用范例，用于在使用隐式信号的黑盒系统中优化内容。

Abstract: Meta titles and descriptions strongly shape engagement in search and
recommendation platforms, yet optimizing them remains challenging. Search
engine ranking models are black box environments, explicit labels are
unavailable, and feedback such as click-through rate (CTR) arrives only
post-deployment. Existing template, LLM, and retrieval-augmented approaches
either lack diversity, hallucinate attributes, or ignore whether candidate
phrasing has historically succeeded in ranking. This leaves a gap in directly
leveraging implicit signals from observable outcomes. We introduce MetaSynth, a
multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation framework that learns from implicit
search feedback. MetaSynth builds an exemplar library from top-ranked results,
generates candidate snippets conditioned on both product content and exemplars,
and iteratively refines outputs via evaluator-generator loops that enforce
relevance, promotional strength, and compliance. On both proprietary e-commerce
data and the Amazon Reviews corpus, MetaSynth outperforms strong baselines
across NDCG, MRR, and rank metrics. Large-scale A/B tests further demonstrate
10.26% CTR and 7.51% clicks. Beyond metadata, this work contributes a general
paradigm for optimizing content in black-box systems using implicit signals.

Abstract: The rapid growth of multi-source, heterogeneous, and multimodal scientific
data has increasingly exposed the limitations of traditional data management.
Most existing DeepResearch (DR) efforts focus primarily on web search while
overlooking local private data. Consequently, these frameworks exhibit low
retrieval efficiency for private data and fail to comply with the FAIR
principles, ultimately resulting in inefficiency and limited reusability. To
this end, we propose IoDResearch (Internet of Data Research), a private
data-centric Deep Research framework that operationalizes the Internet of Data
paradigm. IoDResearch encapsulates heterogeneous resources as FAIR-compliant
digital objects, and further refines them into atomic knowledge units and
knowledge graphs, forming a heterogeneous graph index for multi-granularity
retrieval. On top of this representation, a multi-agent system supports both
reliable question answering and structured scientific report generation.
Furthermore, we establish the IoD DeepResearch Benchmark to systematically
evaluate both data representation and Deep Research capabilities in IoD
scenarios. Experimental results on retrieval, QA, and report-writing tasks show
that IoDResearch consistently surpasses representative RAG and Deep Research
baselines. Overall, IoDResearch demonstrates the feasibility of
private-data-centric Deep Research under the IoD paradigm, paving the way
toward more trustworthy, reusable, and automated scientific discovery.

*Adithya Rajan,Xiaoyu Liu,Prateek Verma,Vibhu Arora*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种以数据为中心的方法，通过使用合成前缀来减轻实时神经查询自动完成系统中的呈现偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决了从实时查询自动完成交互中收集的参与信号中的固有偏差，其中模型建议会影响用户行为。

Method: 通过使用合成前缀丰富训练数据来学习排序模型，这些合成前缀是从未激活自动完成的常规搜索会话期间收集的完整用户查询生成的。引入了列表损失的任务特定简化，将计算复杂度从 $O(n^2)$ 降低到 $O(n)$。

Result: 该系统在大型电子商务环境中部署，在用户参与度方面表现出具有统计意义的改进。

Conclusion: 合成前缀不仅提高了泛化能力，而且为其他低延迟排序任务（包括相关搜索和查询推荐）中的偏差缓解提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in
real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic
prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected
during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows
us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse
and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement
signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model
suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for
real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich
set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,
and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical
alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we
introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing
computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query
autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.
Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates
statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean
reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes
not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias
mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and
query recommendations.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了快速变化的用户偏好，无法处理富含视觉和音频内容的物品，并且难以提供可信的、有证据支持的解释。

Result: 该方法在保持效率的同时，计算开销最小，适用于实际部署。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新颖的推荐框架，能够有效应对现有方法的局限性，并在实际应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation
tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text
prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising
approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM
representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive
fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several
challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static
snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items
contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current
systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete
evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these
limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation
mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through
lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a
unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with
visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be
unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds
recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes,
producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains
the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational
overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in
handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing
transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced
generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through
five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented
generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable
recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our
framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while
incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual
knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous
model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent
improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to
existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in
NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.

Motivation: 现有LLM推荐系统对元数据和属性过滤等简单但重要的组件利用不足。

Method: 利用LLM作为端到端推荐系统，解释用户意图，规划工具调用，协调布尔过滤器（SQL）、稀疏检索（BM25）、密集检索（embedding similarity）和生成式检索（semantic IDs）。

Result: 该工具调用框架在各种推荐场景中表现出有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究设想了一种新的对话式音乐推荐系统范例，通过基于用户查询选择性地采用适当的检索方法。

Abstract: While the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have
successfully enabled generative recommenders with natural language
interactions, their recommendation behavior is limited, leaving other simpler
yet crucial components such as metadata or attribute filtering underutilized in
the system. We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool
calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system
positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user
intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components:
boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding
similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning,
the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the
arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse
modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We
demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive
performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing
appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm
for conversational music recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何从粗粒度评分中恢复细粒度物品排序的问题，发现达到接近完美的排序需要$\\Theta(n^2)$个用户，并提出了一个查询复杂度与理论下限匹配的排序算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多信息检索和推荐系统中的核心任务是对物品进行排序。用户通常以粗略的离散等级对排序任务进行评分。本文旨在探讨是否可以从这些粗略的评分中恢复细粒度的物品排序。

Method: 本文将物品建模为具有分数，用户建模为具有阈值；如果物品的分数超过用户的阈值，则用户会对该物品进行正向评分。用户按顺序到达，并且可以查询每个新用户以优化当前排名。

Result: 本文证明了达到接近完美的排序（以 Spearman 距离衡量）需要 $\\Theta(n^2)$ 个用户（因此需要 $\\Omega(n^2)$ 个查询）。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了在线排序中的一个矛盾：阈值多样性对于将来自许多用户的粗略评级合并为细粒度排序是必要的，但如果事先不知道阈值，这种多样性是有代价的。

Abstract: Ranking items is a central task in many information retrieval and recommender
systems. User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on
a coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a
fine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as
having scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively
if the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on
the total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores
and the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally
partitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside
each bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can
be queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a
near-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\Theta(n^2)$
users (and therefore $\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than
the $O(n\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the
additional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate
thresholds. Our bound also quantifies the impact of a mismatch between score
and threshold distributions via a quadratic divergence factor. To show the
tightness of our results, we provide a ranking algorithm whose query complexity
matches our bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our work reveals a tension in
online ranking: diversity in thresholds is necessary to merge coarse ratings
from many users into a fine-grained ranking, but this diversity has a cost if
the thresholds are a priori unknown.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的检索头选择方法，用于提升大型语言模型（LLM）的重排序性能。该方法选择少量（<1%）与相关文档高度相关的检索头（CoRe heads），降低噪声和冗余，从而显著提高重排序准确性。此外，通过剪枝模型后50%的层，在保持准确性的同时，降低了推理时间和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力的重排序器利用Transformer头的注意力权重产生相关性得分，但并非所有头都同等重要，许多头会引入噪声和冗余，限制性能。

Method: 提出一种对比评分指标，选择与相关文档相关的头部，同时降低与不相关文档相关的头部。该方法称为CoRe heads，用于识别一小组检索头。

Result: 在三个LLM上的大量实验表明，来自CoRe heads的聚合信号（不到所有头的1%）显著提高了重排序准确性，超过了强大的基线。CoRe heads集中在中间层，剪枝模型最后50%的层可以保持准确性，同时显著减少推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 本文提出的CoRe heads方法能够有效提升LLM的重排序性能，并通过剪枝进一步优化推理效率。

Abstract: The strong zero-shot and long-context capabilities of recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) have paved the way for highly effective re-ranking systems.
Attention-based re-rankers leverage attention weights from transformer heads to
produce relevance scores, but not all heads are created equally: many
contribute noise and redundancy, thus limiting performance. To address this, we
introduce CoRe heads, a small set of retrieval heads identified via a
contrastive scoring metric that explicitly rewards high attention heads that
correlate with relevant documents, while downplaying nodes with higher
attention that correlate with irrelevant documents. This relative ranking
criterion isolates the most discriminative heads for re-ranking and yields a
state-of-the-art list-wise re-ranker. Extensive experiments with three LLMs
show that aggregated signals from CoRe heads, constituting less than 1% of all
heads, substantially improve re-ranking accuracy over strong baselines. We
further find that CoRe heads are concentrated in middle layers, and pruning the
computation of final 50% of model layers preserves accuracy while significantly
reducing inference time and memory usage.

Motivation: 原始的Promptagator方法依赖于专有的和大规模的LLM，用户可能无法访问或禁止使用敏感数据。

Method: 研究了可访问规模的开源LLM（≤14B参数）作为替代方案的影响。

Result: 结果表明，小至3B参数的开源LLM可以作为有效的Promptagator风格查询生成器。

Conclusion: 这项工作为从业者提供了可靠的合成数据生成替代方案，并为最大化领域特定应用的微调结果提供了见解。

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot
prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning
domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator
approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have
access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we
study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B
parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as
small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query
generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable
alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize
fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.

### [80] [Ensemble Threshold Calibration for Stable Sensitivity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02116)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端的框架，可以在大规模空间合并和实体匹配任务中实现精确的召回控制，同时保持较低的方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模空间合并和实体匹配任务中，精确的召回控制至关重要，因为即使遗漏少数真正的匹配项也会破坏下游分析，而过多的手动审查会增加成本。传统的置信区间截断（如 Clopper-Pearson 或 Wilson）虽然提供了召回率的下限，但它们通常会超过目标几个百分点，并且在倾斜的分数分布下表现出较高的运行方差。

Method: 该框架首先使用等网格边界框过滤器和压缩稀疏行 (CSR) 候选表示，将配对枚举减少两个数量级。确定性 xxHash 自举样本训练轻量级神经排序器；其分数通过一次前向传播传播到所有剩余对，并用于构建可重现的、按分数十分位数分层的校准集。四种互补的阈值估计器（Clopper-Pearson、Jeffreys、Wilson 和精确分位数）通过逆方差加权进行聚合，然后在九个独立的子样本中融合。这种集成降低了阈值方差。

Result: 在两个真实的地籍数据集（大约 631 万和 6734 万对）上进行评估，该方法始终在小误差范围内达到召回目标，相对于其他校准减少了冗余验证，并在单个 TPU v3 核心上端到端运行。

Conclusion: 该方法可以在大规模空间合并和实体匹配任务中实现精确的召回控制，同时保持较低的方差，并且可以在单个 TPU v3 核心上端到端运行。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

Motivation: 传统密度泛函理论(DFT)方法计算成本高，限制了长期模拟的可行性。

Method: 将MD模拟转化为时间序列预测问题，通过位移而不是绝对位置来预测原子轨迹。结合基于DFT参数化的成对Morse势函数的物理信息损失和推理机制，该函数会惩罚非物理原子邻近度，以增强物理合理性。

Result: 该方法在各种材料的模拟精度上始终优于标准基线。它能够在几分钟内对数千个MD步骤进行稳定建模。

Conclusion: 结合物理知识可以提高原子轨迹预测的可靠性和精度，为昂贵的DFT模拟提供了一种可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为选择性抽样（selective sampling）的方法，旨在提高语言模型生成结果的多样性，同时保持高精度，特别是在数学推理等任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于温度的采样方法可以提高多样性，但在需要高精度的任务中会降低推理质量。这是因为在敏感的解码位置采样了不正确的延续。

Method: 该方法通过一个采样风险指标动态地在贪婪采样和高温采样之间切换。该风险指标估计了在当前 token 位置应用高温采样时输出错误的概率。通过在一个可验证问题的小子集上训练一个轻量级分类器来预测采样风险。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性抽样增强了质量-多样性的权衡，即使在高温设置下也是如此。

Conclusion: 选择性抽样是一种有效的方法，可以在保持精度的同时提高语言模型生成结果的多样性。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一个可重现且具有成本效益的提取管道，并为热电材料之外的可扩展、数据驱动的材料发现奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

### [84] [RSAVQ: Riemannian Sensitivity-Aware Vector Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01240)
*Zukang Xu,Xing Hu,Qiang Wu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSAVQ: A novel VQ framework for low-bit quantization of LLMs, enhancing performance by mitigating unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-bit quantization methods for LLMs using Vector Quantization (VQ) face challenges due to unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation, hindering deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: The paper proposes RSAVQ, which introduces Error Direction Sensitivity Guidance (EDSG) using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity directions and Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) to dynamically guide bit resource allocation.

Result: RSAVQ outperforms existing methods in experiments. For example, in 2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ improves perplexity by 0.4 and zero-shot accuracy by 1.5 compared to baselines like VPTQ and QuIP#.

Conclusion: RSAVQ offers a practical solution for deploying LLMs in constrained environments and bridges information geometry and neural network quantization, advancing efficient deep learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

*Vedant Palit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 联邦学习在部分可观察性下容易受到中毒和后门攻击。提出了一种信任感知深度 Q 网络，该网络将多信号证据整合到客户端信任更新中，同时优化长期稳健性-准确性目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习容易受到中毒和后门攻击，尤其是在部分可观察性的情况下。因此，需要一种防御机制。

Method: 将防御定义为一个部分可观察的序列决策问题，并引入一个信任感知深度 Q 网络。该网络集成了多信号证据到客户端信任更新中，同时优化了一个长期的稳健性-准确性目标。

Result: 在 CIFAR-10 数据集上，(i) 建立了一个基线，显示准确率稳步提高；(ii) 通过 Dirichlet sweep 表明，增加客户端重叠始终提高准确率，并通过稳定检测降低 ASR；(iii) 在信号预算研究中表明，随着可观察性的降低，准确率保持稳定，而 ASR 增加，ROC-AUC 下降，这突出了序列信念更新减轻了较弱的信号。

Conclusion: 与随机、线性 Q 和策略梯度控制器相比，DQN 实现了最佳的稳健性-准确性权衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测列车延误对于高效的铁路运营至关重要。以往的方法主要集中在预测单个列车的确切延误，但最近的研究已经开始探索车站层面的延误预测，以支持更高级别的交通管理。

Method: 该方法结合了多种架构创新和新的特征集成，包括列车频率感知空间注意力。

Result: 在包含 4,735 个车站的印度铁路网络上进行了大量实验，结果表明，与多个最先进的基线相比，该方法在标准指标上表现出持续的改进。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅推进了大型铁路网络中平均延误预测的建模，而且还提供了一个开放数据集，以鼓励在该关键领域进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为 Budgeted Broadcast (BB) 的新的剪枝方法，该方法根据流量预算来平衡选择性和受众，从而提高模型在各种任务中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法主要依赖于参数对损失的影响进行排序，而忽略了流量平衡的重要性。

Method: BB 方法为每个单元分配一个本地流量预算，并通过约束熵分析来最大化编码熵，从而实现选择性-受众平衡。该方法使用简单的本地执行器来修剪扇入或扇出。

Result: BB 方法在 ASR Transformer、人脸识别 ResNet 和突触预测 3D U-Net 等模型上提高了准确性，有时甚至超过了密集基线。在电子显微镜图像上，它达到了最先进的 F1 和 PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB 方法易于集成，并为学习更多样化和高效的表示提供了一条途径。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for

scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.
We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous

*Ali Hatamizadeh,Syeda Nahida Akter,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Jan Kautz,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RLP, a reinforcement pretraining objective that encourages independent thinking in models by rewarding chain-of-thought reasoning based on information gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current method of training reasoning models, which involves pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, may not be optimal.

Method: RLP treats chain-of-thought as an exploratory action and rewards it based on the information gain it provides for predicting future tokens.

Result: Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base improves performance by 19% on a suite of math and science benchmarks. Applying RLP to Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32%.

Conclusion: RLP reframes reinforcement learning for reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

*Rohan Vitthal Thorat,Juhi Singh,Rajdip Nayek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合控制框架，该框架集成了 LQR 和 RL 控制器，以解决基于 RL 的振动控制的关键训练安全挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由外部激励引起的结构振动会带来重大风险，包括乘员的安全隐患、结构损坏和增加的维护成本。传统的基于模型的控制策略（如线性二次调节器 (LQR)）可以有效地减轻振动，但它们依赖于精确的系统模型，因此需要繁琐的系统识别。

Method: 使用线性二次调节器 (LQR) 控制器引导 RL 控制器。LQR 策略来自随机选择的模型及其参数。这种混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最大限度地降低了 naive RL 实现中固有的探索风险。

Result: 即使是基于完全不正确的模型的 LQR 控制器也优于不受控的情况。该混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最大限度地降低了 naive RL 实现中固有的探索风险。

Conclusion: 这是第一个解决基于 RL 的振动控制的关键训练安全挑战并提供经过验证的解决方案的研究。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

Conclusion: 这项研究加深了我们对驱动RNN的复杂机制的理解，并为设计更强大和可解释的神经网络提供了一个有价值的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有PU学习方法在复杂数据集上表现不佳，尤其是在没有辅助负样本或预估参数的情况下。主要瓶颈是在不可靠的监督下学习区分性表示的挑战。

Method: 该方法结合了噪声对鲁棒监督非对比损失 (NoiSNCL) 和幻影标签消除 (PLD) 方案。NoiSNCL 用于对齐类内表示，PLD 通过基于后悔的标签更新提供保守的负监督。

Conclusion: NcPU 框架在正-无标签学习中具有很大的潜力，特别是在实际应用中。

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

Method: 该方法通过轻量级的位置编码扰动来引发潜在信号，这些信号可以指示模型的错误行为。该方法不需要微调或特定任务的监督。

Result: 实验表明，基于扰动的探测方法可以有效地检测各种设置下的失败案例，包括事实性、安全性、毒性和后门攻击。在多个最先进的LLM上的实验证明了这些扰动可以揭示模型的错误行为，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，预训练的LLM已经编码了标记自身失败所需的内部证据，并且受微扫视启发的干预提供了一条检测和减轻不良行为的途径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

TL;DR: ThinKV通过压缩KV缓存来解决大型推理模型中GPU内存溢出的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的长输出上下文生成导致KV缓存快速增长，超出GPU内存容量。

Method: ThinKV基于注意力稀疏性，采用混合量化-驱逐策略，根据思想重要性分配token精度，并逐步驱逐不太重要的token。此外，设计了一个扩展PagedAttention的内核，以有效重用被驱逐token的内存槽。

Result: 在数学和编码基准测试中，ThinKV以不到原始KV缓存5%的容量实现了接近无损的精度，同时提高了性能，推理吞吐量比最先进的基线高出5.8倍。

Conclusion: ThinKV是一种有效的KV缓存压缩框架，可以在保证精度的前提下显著提高推理性能。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型假设训练和测试数据遵循相同的分布，这在现实应用中很少满足。不同交叉口的路面几何形状、信号配时和驾驶员行为的变化通常导致泛化能力差和模型精度降低。

Result: 在亚利桑那州皮马县57个异构交叉口的数据测试表明，GBBW框架提供更准确和稳健的延误估计。

Conclusion: 该方法支持更可靠的交通信号优化、拥堵管理和基于绩效的规划。通过增强模型的可迁移性，该框架有助于在现实交通系统中更广泛地部署机器学习技术。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Abstract: Deep learning-based 3-dimensional (3D) shape reconstruction from
2-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly
important in medical disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and computational
modeling. This review surveys the methodological landscape of 3D MRI
reconstruction, focusing on 4 primary approaches: point cloud, mesh-based,
shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current
state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and
applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview
ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the
clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of
their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets,
computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the
emerging research directions including multimodal integration and
cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a
structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify
opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable,
and clinically impactful solutions.

TL;DR: 研究了在训练损失的梯度中的低秩结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当放宽对训练数据和参数的通常各向同性假设时，两层神经网络的训练损失梯度中的低秩结构。

Method: 考虑一个加 spike 的数据模型，其中 bulk 可以是各向异性的和病态的，不要求独立的数据和权重矩阵，并且分析了平均场和神经正切核缩放。

Result: 结果表明，关于输入权重的梯度近似为低秩，并且由两个秩一项控制：一个与 bulk 数据残差对齐，另一个与输入数据中的秩一对齐。描述了训练数据的属性、缩放比例和激活函数如何控制这两个分量之间的平衡。此外，还证明了诸如权重衰减、输入噪声和雅可比惩罚之类的标准正则化器也可以选择性地调节这些分量。

Conclusion: 在合成数据和真实数据上的实验证实了理论预测

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

*Aritra Das,Joseph T. Iosue,Victor V. Albert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的名为 QuIIEst 的 ID 估计基准，包含具有已知 ID 的拓扑非平凡流形的无限族。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 ID 估计 (IDE) 方法的估计差异很大，需要在比现有基准更复杂的流形上进行 IDE 方法的基准测试。

Method: 提出了一个量子启发的固有维数估计 (QuIIEst) 基准，该基准来自一种嵌入任意齐次空间的量子光学方法，同时允许曲率修改和加性噪声。

Result: 在相同的资源分配下，QuIIEst 流形上的 IDE 方法的准确性通常低于现有基准。随着曲率越来越不均匀，性能下降非常小，突显了基准的内在难度。

Conclusion: 对分形 Hofstadter 蝴蝶进行了 IDE，并确定了哪些方法能够提取非流形空间的有效维度。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们正式描述了这种表示的理想属性、它们的统计优势和潜在的不可识别性来源。

Conclusion: 在合适的条件下，熵正则化的 LAPO 目标可以识别满足我们理想属性的动作表示，解释了离散动作表示在实践中表现良好的原因。

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video
data. We formally describe desiderata for such representations, their
statistical benefits and potential sources of unidentifiability. Finally, we
prove that an entropy-regularized LAPO objective identifies action
representations satisfying our desiderata, under suitable conditions. Our
analysis provides an explanation for why discrete action representations

*Akhlaqur Rahman Sabby,Yi Sui,Tongzi Wu,Jesse C. Cresswell,Ga Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从第一性原理出发，研究了SSRL算法的学习目标是否决定了其可能的优化策略和模型设计选择，并从变分互信息（MI）下界推导出两种训练范式：自蒸馏MI（SDMI）和联合MI（JMI），每种范式都施加不同的结构约束并涵盖一组现有的SSRL算法。 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSRL虽然取得了显著的经验性成功，但其基本原理仍未得到充分理解。现有的工作试图通过检查其信息论目标或总结其用于防止表示崩溃的启发式方法来统一SSRL方法，但诸如预测器网络、停止梯度操作和统计正则化器等架构元素通常被视为经验驱动的附加。

Method: 从变分互信息（MI）下界推导出两种训练范式：自蒸馏MI（SDMI）和联合MI（JMI）。

Result: SDMI本质上需要交替优化，这使得停止梯度操作在理论上是必不可少的。相比之下，JMI允许通过没有此类组件的对称架构进行联合优化。在所提出的公式下，SDMI中的预测器网络和JMI中的统计正则化器成为MI目标的可处理替代。

Conclusion: 本文为现有SSRL方法的不同架构组件的选择提供了理论解释，超越了启发式便利。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估数据集中各向异性的指标，通过区分原始数据集及其随机增强的等效数据集来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称感知机器学习方法（如数据增强和等变架构）旨在提高泛化性和样本效率，但前提是转换后的数据点在测试分布下具有高概率。本文旨在评估这一假设。

Method: 本文开发了一种指标，通过双样本神经分类器测试来量化数据集中的各向异性或对称性破缺。

Result: 该指标在合成数据集上得到验证，并揭示了多个基准点云数据集中惊人的高度对齐现象。理论上表明，即使在标签真正不变的情况下，分布对称性破缺也会阻止不变方法达到最佳性能。经验上发现，对称感知方法的影响取决于数据集。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，理解等变性（无论何时起作用以及为什么）可能需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏差。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.
