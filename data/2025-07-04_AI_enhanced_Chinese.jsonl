Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary\nlengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and\nadvanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and\nhuman-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,\nour findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently\nimprove dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone\nto verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to\ntheir non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and\ndetailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may\nfail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts.

While GDC users can interactively\ncreate complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially\nnew ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of\npossible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe\ntheir desired cohort in free-text natural language.\n  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for\ncurating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the\nGDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of\ntheir desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further\nanalysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the\ngenerated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)\nfor GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC\nCohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC\ncohorts.\n  Availability and implementation: The standalone docker image for GDC Cohort\nCopilot is available at https://quay.io/repository/cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/uc-cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.

We\nprovide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose\nConfidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation\nmetric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior.

Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination.

GeoAda introduces a\nstructured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling\noperators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model\nlayers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an\nequivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight\nadapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while\nmitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that\nthe proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric\ninductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during\nadaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse\ngeometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph\ncontrol, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,\nmolecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation.

In this\nwork, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the\nfeedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by\nPQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter\ncontribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the\nparameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have\nprimarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the\nFFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,\nexpressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a\nresidual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating\nentanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our\nexperiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia\nbenchmarks demonstrate two key findings.

To address these\nissues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement\noccupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame\n3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a\nfeature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow\nMatching SSM module (FMSSM).

We show that despite the complex interactions\nbetween architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained\nmodels exhibit a remarkably precise universality.

The aim of our\nresearch is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning\nmodels through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic\nframework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical\nmodeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay\nbetween residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper\nfocuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most\nbasic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories\ncorresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors\nbetween them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.\nWe show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we\ncall the Gauss-Markov Adjunction.

However, applying SAM to\nremote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually\nconstructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is\nlabor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small\nobjects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain\nadaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to\ncapture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when\nsegmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by\nfew-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM\nutilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific\nobjects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic\nsegmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,\nViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original\narchitecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts\nclass-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware\nprompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target\nAlignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the\ndomain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,\nenabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive\nexperiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,\nLoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and\nautomatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference\nimages and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods\nacross diverse datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViRefSAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6307\u5bfcSAM\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "SAM\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u624b\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u7cbe\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u9065\u611f\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "ViRefSAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u5e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u6307\u5bfcSAM\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3002", "result": "ViRefSAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ViRefSAM\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

An\nideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal\nbackground intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the\ncorresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a\nsemantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse\nappearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based\nmethods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly\ngenerators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when\nthe mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms\nsemantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains\nplausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary\nartifacts.

In this work, we reveal that\napproximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the\nnon-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.\nThis highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that\ndynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could\noptimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,\nwe further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing\nframework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or\nnon-thinking modes.

To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs\nare primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)\nlike humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all\nreasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:\nCan we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon\nin LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage\nfine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and\nredundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes\nof model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined\nwith a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model\nenhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated\nreasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend\nredundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to\nidentify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more\nconcise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that\nTH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%\non hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability.

However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal\nforgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for\nlocalization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been\nstudied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,\nleveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16\n\\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL\nlocalization due to enormous amounts ($\\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256\n\\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with\nEnhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and\nadaptability with minimal forgetting.

The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration.

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental\nevaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB\nNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based\nweakly supervised segmentation.

Our approach\nincorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative\nsummarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic\nunderstanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply\nscene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:\nhighlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant\ncontent. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel\nbenchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500\nprofessionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both\ngeneral and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the\nquality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHIVE\u7684\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53d9\u4e8b\u7406\u89e3\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u6d53\u7f29\u6210\u7b80\u6d01\u800c\u5f15\u4eba\u5165\u80dc\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6765\u81eaASR\u6587\u672c\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7247\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u73af\u5883\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4eba\u7269\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5206\u6790\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u6982\u62ec\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u5e76\u5c06\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u7a81\u51fa\u663e\u793a\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5f00\u5934/\u7ed3\u5c3e\u9009\u62e9\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fee\u526a\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u7740\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u8f91\u89c6\u9891\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u7740\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u8f91\u89c6\u9891\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual\nmodality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world\nenvironments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from\ntarget MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.\nHowever, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger\nfor unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding\nin realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric\njailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in\nconstructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)\nmethod that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant\nprompts through parallel graph networks.

Inspired by general object detection,\nnon-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be\npotential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional\nfully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes\na new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires\nsimple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our\nscheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential\ntarget mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and\nmulti-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to\nfurther improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity\nbetween positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose\na long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the\nlocal motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The\nextensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that\nour weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised\nmethods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nfully-supervised ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff08WeCoL\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u91cf\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7531\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5c0f\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u5f31\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u7684\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u76ee\u6807\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u6ce8\u91ca\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u901a\u5e38\u65e2\u6602\u8d35\u53c8\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u5e27\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u4f55\u4e8b\u7269\u6a21\u578b\uff08SAM\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6316\u6398\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u6fc0\u6d3b\u56fe\u548c\u591a\u5e27\u80fd\u91cf\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6b63\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08DAUB\u548cITSDT-15K\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\uff08SOTA\uff09\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u768490\uff05\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002"}}

The\nreliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR\ndata. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including\nmisrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they\nare primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality\nassessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess\ndata fitness for research.\n  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit\ntesting and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data\nquality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking\nTool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test\ngenerator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a\ntest suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework\nthat executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.\n  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and\nSyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These\ntests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We\npresent a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of\nreference grounding and value accuracy.\n  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable\ncontext-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to\nimprove the validity of its outcomes.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data\non unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable\nflexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we\nintroduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively\npartitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to\nleverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.\nExperimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on\nscientific data encoding tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MC-INR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u805a\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eINR\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a(1)\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c(2)\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c(3)\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f53\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u805a\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u805a\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u533a\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5206\u652f\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "MC-INR\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MC-INR\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Building on this\nparadigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction\nacross Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein\ninteraction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical\nattributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.\nThe proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that\nemulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The\nframework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a\ndata-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned\nembedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments\non benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data\nregimes.

We attribute\nthis issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.\nTo address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework\nthat decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,\nCanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity\nmodification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped\nfeature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the\npreservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve\nprecise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we\ndesign a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source\nidentity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial\nregions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization\nmetrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping\nmethods.
