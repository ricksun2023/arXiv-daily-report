Source code and experimental\n  artifacts are available at: https://github.com/aymanehassini/DynaQuery . The\n  'DynaQuery-Eval-5K' benchmark, introduced in this work, is also publicly\n  available at:\n  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aymanehassini/dynaquery-eval-5k-benchmark", "summary": "The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has accelerated the long-standing\ngoal of enabling natural language querying over complex, hybrid databases. Yet,\nthis ambition exposes a dual challenge: reasoning jointly over structured,\nmulti-relational schemas and the semantic content of linked unstructured\nassets. To overcome this, we present DynaQuery - a unified, self-adapting\nframework that serves as a practical blueprint for next-generation \"Unbound\nDatabases.\" At the heart of DynaQuery lies the Schema Introspection and Linking\nEngine (SILE), a novel systems primitive that elevates schema linking to a\nfirst-class query planning phase. We conduct a rigorous, multi-benchmark\nempirical evaluation of this structure-aware architecture against the prevalent\nunstructured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm. Our results\ndemonstrate that the unstructured retrieval paradigm is architecturally\nsusceptible to catastrophic contextual failures, such as SCHEMA_HALLUCINATION,\nleading to unreliable query generation. In contrast, our SILE-based design\nestablishes a substantially more robust foundation, nearly eliminating this\nfailure mode. Moreover, end-to-end validation on a complex, newly curated\nbenchmark uncovers a key generalization principle: the transition from pure\nschema-awareness to holistic semantics-awareness. Taken together, our findings\nprovide a validated architectural basis for developing natural language\ndatabase interfaces that are robust, adaptable, and predictably consistent.", "AI": {"tldr": "DynaQuery is a framework for natural language querying over hybrid databases, using a Schema Introspection and Linking Engine (SILE) to improve query planning.", "motivation": "Enable natural language querying over complex, hybrid databases by reasoning over structured schemas and unstructured content.", "method": "Develop DynaQuery, a unified, self-adapting framework with SILE for schema linking as a query planning phase.", "result": "DynaQuery reduces contextual failures like SCHEMA_HALLUCINATION compared to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).", "conclusion": "DynaQuery provides a robust and adaptable architecture for natural language database interfaces."}}

We argue for a\nshift from narrow AutoRecSys tools -- focused on algorithm selection and\nhyper-parameter tuning -- to an Autonomous Recommender-Systems Research Lab\n(AutoRecLab) that integrates end-to-end automation: problem ideation,\nliterature analysis, experimental design and execution, result interpretation,\nmanuscript drafting, and provenance logging. Drawing on recent progress in\nautomated science (e.g., multi-agent AI Scientist and AI Co-Scientist systems),\nwe outline an agenda for the RecSys community: (1) build open AutoRecLab\nprototypes that combine LLM-driven ideation and reporting with automated\nexperimentation; (2) establish benchmarks and competitions that evaluate agents\non producing reproducible RecSys findings with minimal human input; (3) create\nreview venues for transparently AI-generated submissions; (4) define standards\nfor attribution and reproducibility via detailed research logs and metadata;\nand (5) foster interdisciplinary dialogue on ethics, governance, privacy, and\nfairness in autonomous research. Advancing this agenda can increase research\nthroughput, surface non-obvious insights, and position RecSys to contribute to\nemerging Artificial Research Intelligence.
