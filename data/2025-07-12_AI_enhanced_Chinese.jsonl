To mitigate these issues, we propose a\nMulti-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL.

However, there is an inherent bias in the clicks of users due\nto position bias, i.e., users are more likely to click highly-ranked documents\nthan low-ranked documents. To address this bias when training LTR models, many\napproaches from the literature re-weight the users' click data using Inverse\nPropensity Scoring (IPS). IPS re-weights the user's clicks proportionately to\nthe position in the historical ranking that a document was placed when it was\nclicked since low-ranked documents are less likely to be seen by a user. In\nthis paper, we argue that low-ranked documents that are similar to\nhighly-ranked relevant documents are also likely to be relevant. Moreover,\naccounting for the similarity of low-ranked documents to highly ranked relevant\ndocuments when calculating IPS can more effectively mitigate the effects of\nposition bias. Therefore, we propose an extension to IPS, called IPSsim, that\ntakes into consideration the similarity of documents when estimating IPS. We\nevaluate our IPSsim estimator using two large publicly available LTR datasets\nunder a number of simulated user click settings, and with different numbers of\ntraining clicks. Our experiments show that our IPSsim estimator is more\neffective than the existing IPS estimators for learning an unbiased LTR model,\nparticularly in top-n settings when n >= 30.

Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high\ncomputational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor\ncounts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest\nPath for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node\nencodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first\napplies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the\nshortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting\nsequence of node embeddings using a sequence model.

Prior work in this\ncontext has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from\nopen-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval\nchallenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with\npretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study\nArabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from\nreal-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of\nlanguages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently\nand uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual\nretrieval behavior.\n  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual\ndomain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when\nthe user query and supporting document languages differ.

Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of\nraw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as\nVec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding\ncan successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The\nunexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct\nfurther verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and\nopaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we\nreproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)\nvalidating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted\nexperiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both\nin-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due\nto missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.\nFurthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity\nanalysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,\npasswords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy\ndefense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,\ncapable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear\nsemantics.

For example,\ncomputational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning\ntechniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would\nenable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty\nquantification.

Despite its empirical success, the theoretical\nproperties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,\nwe first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability\nevolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to\ninitialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can\ninadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This\nmisallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising\nboth the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended\npreferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a\ntheoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate\nsupervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference\noptimization.

Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed\npipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and\ncommunication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential\nadversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously\noverlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the\nmodel are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the\nintermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.\nWe demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker\ncan craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning\nsystem significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the\nintercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill\nsurrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples\nagainst the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy\nspecifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing\nthe original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple\nstatistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to\nenable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic\nexperimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models\ntrained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,\ntremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks.

To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first\ninvestigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation\nby deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use\nprimarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly\napplying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,\nlimited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable\nExamples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on\nlarge-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on\nunlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure\nand thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of\nTUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the\nlearning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training.

In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic\nfeatures, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is\nimportant. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of\nlabeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these\nproblems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to\neffectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid\nartery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:\na coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some\nprior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a\nfine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To\neffectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,\nwe investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level\nmulti-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of\nlimited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a\nsemi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input\ntransformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with\narteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion\npoint selection in U-Net-based architectures.

To address\nthis issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains\nBradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based\nreward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a\nconnection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their\ncomplementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the\nsingle-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in\nchallenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring\ncapability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to\noutperform a 70B baseline.

Existing methods typically represent\nthe human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic\nphysical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and\nmakes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we\npropose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human\ntopology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To\npreserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial\nfield for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal\ndependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.\nInter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the\ndependencies of joints at different scales.

Despite\nits significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss\nfunction used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the\nconventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on\nresponse tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction\ntuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of\ndifferentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,\nand propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to\nconventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language\nmodels of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different\nsizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard\ninstruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited\nrobustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight\nfor prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens\nyields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better\nstarting points for the subsequent preference alignment training.

Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and\ndepth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often\ntrade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge\nthis gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a\nplug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and\na dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D\nflood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to\nmultispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer\nmodel to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without\nchanging the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is\nbased on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the\n2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood\nboundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case\nstudy on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled\nwith SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\\%.

The demand for real-time AD has surged\nwith the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of\nmultivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD\nrequires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also\noperate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical\ninstances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We\npropose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for\nmultivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.\nUnlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that\nprocess entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors\nthe correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling\nefficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking\npractices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy\ntailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios.

To address these challenges, we propose\na Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC\nemploys a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge\nlow-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting\npixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic\nimportance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving\ncritical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating\ntrajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a\ntraining-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible\nmotion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative\nmodels.

Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting\nhas been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating\nintermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs.

To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as\na KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional\nlog-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding\n(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes\nvisual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and\nrationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that\nRED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and\nother decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a\npractical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy\nof CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded\nmulti-modal systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LVLM\u5728CoT\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51faRED\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8CoT\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LVLM\u5728CoT\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7406\u7531\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u7406\u7531\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u7801 (RED)\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7406\u7531\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4e58\u6765\u534f\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7406\u7531\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "RED\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cLVLM\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RED\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LVLM\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u7531\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}
