### [1] [Haystack Engineering: Context Engineering for Heterogeneous and Agentic Long-Context Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07414)
*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个新的长文本评估基准HaystackCraft，旨在更真实地模拟实际应用中噪声长文本环境，揭示了现有模型在复杂检索和agentic工作流中面临的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本模型在合成测试中表现良好，但忽略了真实场景中噪声上下文的产生方式，即有偏检索和agentic工作流。

Method: 构建了HaystackCraft基准，该基准基于完整的英文维基百科超链接网络，包含多跳问题，并评估不同检索策略和agentic操作对模型性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，更强的稠密检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰项，而基于图的重排序可以提高检索效果并减轻有害干扰项。在agentic测试中，即使是像Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-5这样的高级模型也会因自我生成的干扰项而遭受级联失败，或难以执行早期停止。

Conclusion: 本文强调了agentic长文本推理中存在的持续挑战，并将HaystackCraft确立为未来研究的有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [2] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了社会媒体平台对城市环境理解的转变，以及人类感知和观点中细微的情感反应变化，并挑战了现有的城市研究中的多维情感分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类感知和观点中细微的情感反应变化，并挑战现有的城市研究中的多维情感分析方法。

Method: 构建包含140,750个百度和腾讯街景图像的数据集来衡量感知，以及984,024个微博社交媒体文本帖子来衡量观点。开发了一种反应指数，整合了对象检测和自然语言处理技术来分类2016年和2022年北京二环的情感。

Result: 感知情感反应趋势图显示出向更均匀分布的积极情感的转变，而观点情感反应趋势图显示出更极端的变化。不匹配图表明，多年来，人类对城市地区的感知和观点的 sentiment 之间存在显着差异。情感反应的变化与密集建筑物和行人存在等因素有显着关系。

Conclusion: 不一致的地图呈现了疫情前后的感知和观点情感，并为环境管理提供了潜在的解释和方向，从而为城市更新制定了策略。

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

### [3] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大型语言模型在词形还原任务中的能力，并与传统的完全监督方法进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在各种自然语言处理任务中表现出强大的能力，但它们在上下文词形还原任务中的效果尚不清楚。

Method: 本文通过实验比较了大型语言模型与encoder-only监督方法和跨语言方法在12种不同形态复杂度的语言上的上下文词形还原效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，虽然encoder在异构领域中经过微调后仍具有竞争力，但目前的大型语言模型在大多数语言中，只需提供一些示例，即可直接生成上下文词形还原结果，达到最先进的水平，而无需事先进行微调。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中具有强大的能力，可以达到甚至超过传统监督方法的效果。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [4] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的ASR评估指标LASER，以更准确地评估语音识别系统，减少对语义影响不大的形态和句法差异的过度惩罚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的词错误率（WER）等ASR评估指标会不公平地惩罚那些对句子语义没有显著影响的形态和句法差异。

Method: 利用先进的LLM的上下文学习能力，LASER通过包含详细示例的提示来学习。使用Gemini 2.5 Pro的印地语LASER评分与人工标注的相关性高达94%。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro的印地语LASER评分与人工标注的相关性高达94%。提示中的印地语示例也能有效分析其他印度语言（如马拉地语、卡纳达语和马拉雅拉姆语）的错误。Llama 3等较小的LLM可以通过在从参考和ASR预测中导出的词对示例上进行微调，以接近89%的准确率预测应施加何种惩罚。

Conclusion: LASER有效地利用LLM来更准确地评估ASR系统，并且可以通过微调较小的LLM来实现。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究对以人体骨骼姿势形式呈现的手语表达进行有意义的评估，涵盖基于关键点距离、基于嵌入和基于反向翻译的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何评估手语表达，特别是以人体骨骼姿势形式呈现的手语表达。

Method: 研究了基于关键点距离、基于嵌入和基于反向翻译的指标，并通过自动元评估和人工关联研究展示了不同场景下不同指标之间的权衡。

Result: 展示了在不同场景下不同指标之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果和开源姿势评估工具包为开发和评估手语翻译或生成系统提供了一种实用且可复用的方法。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

### [6] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法，利用LLM和CoT提示来测量民粹主义的意识形态内容，以解决传统文本分析方法成本高、耗时和难以扩展的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于文本分析的民粹主义意识形态内容测量方法成本高、耗时且难以扩展。

Method: 采用了一种基于规则和锚定的链式思考（CoT）提示方法，该方法模仿人类编码员的训练过程。通过利用全球民粹主义数据库（GPD），复制用于训练人类编码员的过程，通过提示LLM使用相同文档的改编版本来指导模型的推理。

Result: 该领域特定的提示策略使LLM能够达到与专家人工编码员相当的分类精度，展示了其驾驭民粹主义细微的、对上下文敏感的方面的能力。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了LLM在民粹主义意识形态内容测量方面的潜力，并提供了一种更有效和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

### [7] [MAPRO: Recasting Multi-Agent Prompt Optimization as Maximum a Posteriori Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07475)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MAPRO的框架，用于优化多智能体系统中智能体的提示，以提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统可以通过协调专业角色来超越单个智能体，但由于提示敏感性和系统不稳定，设计有效的多智能体系统仍然很困难。虽然最近在自动提示设计方面的努力减少了手动工作，但多智能体提示优化在很大程度上仍未被探索。

Method: 该框架将多智能体提示优化问题建模为最大后验（MAP）推理问题，并使用一种语言引导的最大积信念传播算法的变体来解决它。为了解决信用分配问题并迭代更新系统，MAPRO采用了一种拓扑感知细化机制，该机制集成了执行反馈和下游归因，以选择性地更新代理提示。

Result: 在各种任务的基准测试中，MAPRO实现了最先进的性能，始终超过手动设计的基线和最近的自动化替代方案。

Conclusion: MAPRO的基于MAP的公式也为将来构建更可靠和有原则的多智能体系统提供了通用指南。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [8] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade是一个异步框架，用于提升LLM在测试时缩放(TTS)场景下的推理效率，通过预测query状态和解耦KV缓存过滤，实现了与最先进的方法相比更低的time-per-output-token (TPOT) 和更高的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的query-aware page-level sparse decoding方法在TTS任务中存在效率瓶颈，尤其是在高并发和长CoT场景下，因为其依赖于顺序相关的页面过滤和粗粒度的token选择。

Method: 提出了AsyncSpade，包含两个核心组件：(1) 一个轻量级的时序回归模块，用于预测下一个token的query状态；(2) 一个异步和分离的框架，将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离，通过异步性将token级别的KV选择与前向推理计算重叠。

Result: 在A100节点上的实验表明，AsyncSpade完全重叠了KV-cache操作与推理流程，实现了理论上的最佳time-per-output-token (TPOT)。与最先进的基线方法相比，TPOT降低了20%以上，与Qwen3-8B和Qwen3-32B模型上的完全注意力相比，TPOT降低了至少50%，同时在各种TTS基准测试中匹配或超过了它们的准确性。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade是第一个在不牺牲模型性能的情况下消除顺序依赖性的方法，显著提升了LLM在TTS任务中的推理效率。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

*Rasika Muralidharan,Jaewoon Kwak,Jisun An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的多智能体系统（MAS）中的团队动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类团队科学的启发，提出了一个多智能体框架，以检查团队科学的核心方面：结构、多样性和互动动态。

Method: 在常识和社交推理的四个任务上评估团队表现：CommonsenseQA、StrategyQA、Social IQa和Latent Implicit Hate。

Result: 扁平团队的表现往往优于分层团队，而多样性具有细微的影响。访谈表明，智能体对其团队表现过于自信，但任务后的反思揭示了对合作的赞赏以及整合方面的挑战，包括有限的对话协调。

Conclusion: 智能体对其团队表现过于自信，但任务后的反思揭示了对合作的赞赏以及整合方面的挑战，包括有限的对话协调。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了CoT微调对多流语音LLM的影响，并提出了通过在用户查询结束前开始推理来减少推理延迟的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究表明，CoT prompting或微调可以显著提高基于文本的LLM的推理能力，但语音LLM在复杂的推理任务中仍然struggle。

Method: 1. 研究CoT微调对多流语音LLM的影响。
2. 提出一种基于熵的指标“问题完整性”，以指导模型在最佳时间开始推理。
3. 使用直接偏好优化（DPO）来进一步提高准确率-延迟帕累托前沿。

Result: 1. 在一系列口语推理任务中，文本空间中的推理使语音LLM的准确率平均提高了2.4倍。
2. 与基于启发式的方法相比，该方法在等效延迟条件下，在ARC-Easy上产生了4％的准确率提升。
3. 使用DPO在不损失准确性的情况下，将延迟减少了70％。

Conclusion: 本文证明了CoT微调可以显著提高语音LLM的推理能力，并且通过在用户查询结束前开始推理可以有效减少推理延迟。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为ToTAL的框架，通过使用思想模板来改进长文本语言模型(LCLM)在知识密集型多跳推理中的表现。该框架利用从先前问题解决轨迹中提取的可重用思想缓存，指导证据的组合和多跳推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅仅将更多文档输入到上下文窗口无法捕捉到证据应该如何连接，为了解决这个问题。

Method: 该论文提出了思想模板，并将推理重塑为可重用的思想缓存。此外，还提出了一种更新策略，通过自然语言反馈迭代优化从训练数据中提取的模板。

Result: 在各种基准测试和LCLM系列中，该方法在基于检索和无检索设置中均优于强大的基线。优化后的模板可以提炼成更小的开源模型。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的ToTAL框架能够有效地提升LCLM在知识密集型多跳推理中的性能，并且具有广泛的适用性和透明的推理重用性。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

### [12] [ParsTranslit: Truly Versatile Tajik-Farsi Transliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07520)
*Rayyan Merchant,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的序列到序列模型，用于塔吉克-波斯语的音译，该模型在所有可用的数据集上进行训练，并提供了两个我们自己的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管每个国家的方言之间存在显着的相似之处，但文字差异阻碍了塔吉克斯坦与其波斯语“兄弟姐妹”之间的书面交流和互动。先前发布的工作已经研究了机器音译模型以在这两种文字之间进行转换。不幸的是，大多数努力没有使用他们自己创建的数据集以外的数据集，从而将这些模型限制在某些文本领域，例如古老的诗歌或单词列表。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的最先进的序列到序列模型，用于跨所有可用数据集训练的塔吉克-波斯语音译，并展示了我们自己的两个数据集。

Result: 我们的模型实现了从波斯语到塔吉克语的 87.91 和 0.05 的 chrF++ 和标准化 CER 分数，以及从塔吉克语到波斯语的 92.28 和 0.04 的分数。

Conclusion: 我们的跨领域结果提供了对任务的更清晰的理解，并设置了全面的可比领先基准。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 推测性解码在长文本中表现不佳，现有方法无法推广到实际场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测性解码方法在长文本处理中性能下降，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 提出一种名为OWL的新模型，它结合了LSTM drafter、特殊token和混合解码算法。

Result: OWL模型在长文本输入上的接受长度比EAGLE3高出约5倍。

Conclusion: OWL模型通过创新设计，显著提升了长文本处理中的推测性解码性能。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

Motivation: 现有的大型LVLMs在图表理解任务中表现出潜力，但小型模型表现不佳，限制了它们在资源受限环境中的应用。

Method: 本文提出了两种方法：多标准提示，将多个评估标准合并到一个查询中；领域自适应迁移学习，在图表数据集上对2B参数的LVLM进行微调，创建ChartJudge。

Result: 实验表明，多标准提示暴露了鲁棒性差距，导致7B模型性能大幅下降。同时，小型LVLM（ChartJudge）能够有效地从一个数据集迁移知识到另一个数据集，使其成为更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 本文的细粒度分析提供了模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡，从而为图表推理任务实现了可扩展、低成本的评估。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在移动平台上部署自然语言处理 (NLP) 模型，特别是轻量级 BERT 编码器，用于命名实体识别 (NER) 和文本分类任务。作者提出了一种基于任务主要 LoRA 模块的多任务预训练框架，以解决朴素多任务预训练中的冲突优化信号问题，从而在满足实际部署约束的同时，实现了与单独预训练相当的性能。

Motivation: 在移动平台上部署自然语言处理 (NLP) 模型需要在内存和计算方面保持高效的同时，适应不同的应用程序。轻量级 BERT 编码器在移动 NLP 领域具有潜力，但如何提高其适应性是一个挑战。

Method: 作者提出了一种基于任务主要 LoRA 模块的多任务预训练框架。该框架使用带有模块化适配器的单个共享编码器主干，以避免朴素多任务预训练中的冲突优化信号。

Result: 在 21 个下游任务上的实验表明，该方法在 NER 任务上平均提高了 +0.8%，在文本分类任务上平均提高了 +8.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法对于通用的移动 NLP 应用程序是有效的，能够在满足实际部署约束的同时，实现与单独预训练相当的性能。

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算语言学分析，研究了与疫情相关的在线讨论，旨在区分健康虚假信息和事实性信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是了解语言如何区分健康虚假信息和事实性信息，从而助力识别虚假信息，并为公共健康信息传播策略和危机传播理论模型提供信息。

Method: 该研究使用了三个语料库：COVID-19虚假叙事、一般COVID-19内容和猴痘相关帖子，并分析了可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用的显著差异。

Result: 研究结果表明，COVID-19虚假信息的可读性得分明显较低，且包含的与恐惧相关或说服性术语的频率是其他数据集的两倍以上。此外，它很少使用感叹号，这与猴痘内容中更具情感化的风格形成对比。

Conclusion: 研究表明，虚假信息采用了一种刻意复杂的修辞风格，其中嵌入了情感线索，这种结合可能会增强其感知可信度。研究结果强调了语言指标可能有助于检测工作，并为公共健康信息传播策略提供信息。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个使用大型语言模型（LLM）来辅助构建人工语言的系统。该系统包括音系生成、句子翻译、词典构建、正字法设计和语法手册编写等模块。该研究旨在探索LLM在语言学方面的知识，并尝试将其应用于高资源语言到低资源语言的翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究的动机有两个：一是为人工语言的创造提供有趣的工具；二是探索LLM对语言和语言学概念的理解程度。此外，还探讨了将该方法应用于高资源语言到低资源语言翻译的可能性。

Method: 该系统采用模块化方法，包括：1) 使用agentic方法创建目标语言的音系；2) 将英语句子翻译成反映目标语言语序和形态句法特征的标记；3) 使用音系模型和从翻译句子中提取的词素构建词典；4) 为该语言提供正字法；5) 编写该语言的简要语法手册。

Result: 研究结果表明，不同LLM在处理不同语言规范方面的能力存在较大差距，系统更容易处理更常见的模式。在高资源语言到低资源语言的翻译方面，目前的结果大多为负面，但有证据表明改进后的系统可能会带来一些实际收益。

Conclusion: 该系统为人工语言的构建提供了一个有趣的工具，并为探索LLM在语言学方面的知识提供了一个平台。未来的研究可以集中在改进系统在高资源语言到低资源语言翻译方面的性能。

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型通过操纵多层输入嵌入向量的几何结构来工作。本文研究了语言模型的输入词汇表表示是如何构建的，以及这种结构如何在训练过程中演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型的输入词汇表表示是如何构建的，以及这种结构如何在训练过程中演变。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，将两个开源模型（Pythia 12B 和 OLMo 7B）的输入和输出嵌入的几何结构与训练过程中的语义、句法和基于频率的指标相关联。

Result: 1) 在训练过程中，词汇嵌入几何结构迅速收敛到与一套语义和句法特征的高度相关性；2) 高频词和功能词（例如，“the”，“of”）的嵌入比词汇和低频词更快地收敛到它们的最终向量，后者保留了与随机初始化的偏差的一些对齐。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于绘制输入嵌入围绕语言结构组织的动态轨迹，揭示了词频和功能的不同作用。这些发现促使人们更深入地研究词汇几何结构的演变如何促进模型训练过程中特定能力的提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with clinical coding, especially with hierarchically close codes. Prompt engineering and fine-tuning can improve accuracy. A new benchmark dataset of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10 codes is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing, and decision-making. Existing evaluations overlook errors where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect, and existing datasets have limitations.

Method: Prompt engineering and small-scale fine-tuning are used to improve accuracy. Clinical code verification is introduced as a standalone task and a pipeline component. A new expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10 codes is released.

Result: Lightweight interventions improve accuracy without the computational overhead of search-based methods. Verification is an effective and reliable step toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

Conclusion: Verification is an effective and reliable step toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）在访问控制中遵守角色边界的能力，即根据角色权限决定是否响应请求。

Method: 创建了一个新的数据集，扩展了Spider和BIRD文本到SQL数据集，并修改了真实的PostgreSQL基于角色的策略，在表和列级别进行评估。比较了三种设计：(i)零或少样本提示，(ii)两步生成器-验证器pipeline，检查SQL策略，(iii)LoRA微调模型，直接学习权限意识。

Result: 显式验证（两步框架）提高了拒绝精度，降低了错误许可。微调在安全性和实用性之间取得了更好的平衡。更长更复杂的策略降低了所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 发布了RBAC增强的数据集和代码。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace rigid multi-screen workflows with a single dialogue for core financial transactions.

Method: Using four LLM-powered agents (Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ) each with a task-specific LoRA adapter to ILMU, a closed-source LLM, hosted within the bank's infrastructure.

Result: A regulator-approved natural-language interface that reliably supports core financial operations under strict governance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that natural-language interfaces can reliably support core financial operations with strict governance.

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

*Yuzhe Gu,Xiyu Liang,Jiaojiao Zhao,Enmao Diao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的缓存淘汰框架，名为 Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache)，旨在解决长上下文大型语言模型（LLM）中因缓存所有键值（KV）状态而导致的巨大内存开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的缓存淘汰方法通常使用启发式方法，通过累积的注意力权重对 tokens 进行排序，但没有考虑它们对注意力输出的真正影响。因此，需要一种更有效的方法来评估 token 的重要性。

Method: OBCache 将缓存淘汰问题转化为一个分层结构化的剪枝问题，并基于 Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) 理论，通过测量剪枝 tokens 引起的注意力输出扰动来量化 token 的显著性，从而得出 isolated keys, isolated values, 和 joint key-value pairs 的闭式分数。

Result: 在 LLaMA 和 Qwen 模型上的实验表明，用 OBCache 的输出感知分数替换现有工作中的启发式分数，可以持续提高长上下文的准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache 框架能够更准确地评估 tokens 的重要性，从而更有效地进行缓存淘汰，提高长上下文 LLM 的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用自然语言推理（NLI）作为语言模型中社会偏见的评估指标，与传统的token probability (TP) 指标进行对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TP指标在评估语言模型中的社会偏见时受到批评，因为它们与实际应用场景和危害存在距离。因此，论文旨在测试NLI作为一种更现实的替代偏见指标。

Method: 通过实验对比NLI和TP指标在偏见评估中的表现，包括它们之间的相关性，以及对“欠去偏见”情况的检测能力。

Result: NLI和TP偏见评估表现出显著差异，NLI指标之间以及NLI和TP指标之间的相关性非常低。NLI指标更有可能检测到“欠去偏见”的情况，但对反刻板印象句子的措辞更敏感。

Conclusion: Token probability和natural language inference都不是在所有情况下都“更好”的偏见指标，建议结合使用TP、NLI和下游偏见评估，以确保对语言模型进行全面的评估。

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了一种系统的方法来测试模型特性规范，自动识别当前模型规范中大量原则冲突和解释模糊的案例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）越来越多地从人工智能章程和模型规范中进行训练，这些规范确立了行为准则和道德原则。然而，这些规范面临着严峻的挑战，包括原则之间的内部冲突和对细微场景的覆盖不足。

Method: 通过生成在相互竞争的基于价值的原则之间强制进行明确权衡的场景来对当前模型规范进行压力测试。使用全面的分类法，我们生成不同的价值权衡场景，其中模型必须在无法同时满足的成对合法原则之间进行选择。

Result: 在我们生成的场景中，我们发现了超过 70,000 个表现出显著行为差异的案例。实证表明，模型行为的这种高度差异强烈预测了模型规范中潜在的问题。通过定性分析，我们提供了当前模型规范中的大量示例问题，例如直接矛盾和对几个原则的解释模糊性。此外，我们生成的数据集还揭示了我们研究的所有前沿模型中的明显错位案例和假阳性拒绝。

Conclusion: 我们还提供了这些模型的价值优先级模式和差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的仇恨言论检测框架，该框架可以识别隐式仇恨言论，并通过因果推理来提高模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的仇恨言论检测模型难以捕捉到通过讽刺、反讽、刻板印象或编码语言等方式表达的隐式仇恨言论，并且在不同的平台上的仇恨言论针对不同的群体，具有独特的风格，这给现有的检测方法带来了挑战。

Method: 本文构建了一个因果图，将仇恨言论的生成建模为涉及关键因素（上下文环境、创建者动机、目标和风格）的过程。在此基础上，提出了一种因果表征学习框架CADET，该框架将仇恨言论分解为可解释的潜在因素，并通过控制混淆因素，从而将真实的仇恨意图与表面语言线索隔离开来。

Result: CADET在综合实验中表现出卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果表明，因果先验在推进通用仇恨言论检测方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

TL;DR: MemWeaver框架通过构建分层记忆，利用用户文本历史进行深度个性化生成，克服了现有方法无法有效建模用户兴趣动态性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将用户历史视为文本的扁平列表，无法建模反映用户兴趣动态性的丰富的时间和语义结构，导致个性化程度较浅。

Method: 提出MemWeaver框架，将用户整个文本历史编织成一个分层记忆，以支持深度个性化生成。该框架构建了行为记忆和认知记忆两个互补的记忆组件，分别在不同抽象层次上整合时间和语义信息。

Result: 在LaMP基准上的实验验证了MemWeaver的有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver框架能够有效地利用用户的文本历史进行深度个性化生成。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)

*Jiaoyang Li,Junhao Ruan,Shengwei Tang,Saihan Chen,Kaiyan Chang,Yuan Ge,Tong Xiao,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SubQRAG improves multi-hop question answering by decomposing complex questions into sub-questions and dynamically expanding the knowledge graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph RAG lacks deep structured reasoning for complex multi-hop QA, leading to incomplete evidence and error accumulation.

Method: SubQRAG decomposes questions into sub-questions, retrieves relevant triples, dynamically expands the graph when needed, and aggregates triples into a graph memory.

Result: SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements on three multi-hop QA benchmarks, especially in Exact Match scores.

Conclusion: SubQRAG enhances reasoning depth by using a sub-question-driven framework that expands the knowledge graph dynamically.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

*Cunli Mao,Xiaofei Gao,Ran Song,Shizhu He,Shengxiang Gao,Kang Liu,Zhengtao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于大型语言模型(llm)的跨语言知识图谱补全(MKGC)框架，该框架利用多语言共享知识来显著提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MKGC研究未能充分利用llm的多语言能力，并忽略了跨语言知识的可共享性。

Method: 本文提出的框架包括知识水平分组混合专家(KL-GMoE)和迭代实体重排序(IER)两个组成部分。KL-GMoE有效地建模了共享知识，而IER显著地提高了其利用率。

Result: 本文构建了一个包含5种语言的mKG数据集，并通过全面的对比实验验证了该框架的有效性。实验结果表明，与SOTA MKGC方法相比，该框架在Hits@1、Hits@3和Hits@10指标上分别提高了5.47%、3.27%和1.01%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的MKGC框架能够有效地利用多语言共享知识，并在跨语言知识图谱补全任务上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

*Fu Chen,Peng Wang,Xiyin Li,Wen Li,Shichi Lei,Dongdong Xiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ToolExpander框架，增强资源受限的LLM的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小规模LLM在使用GRPO训练时，常因无法生成准确回复而导致性能下降和训练崩溃。

Method: 引入动态多轮硬采样（Dynamic Multi-Round Hard Sampling）和自例证思考（Self-Exemplifying Thinking）。

Result: ToolExpander显著提升了LLM的工具使用能力，尤其是在较弱的小规模模型中。

Conclusion: ToolExpander提高了训练稳定性和整体性能

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

*Tianci Liu,Ran Xu,Tony Yu,Ilgee Hong,Carl Yang,Tuo Zhao,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的大规模的(prompt, rubric)对集合OpenRubrics，用于训练rubric生成和基于rubric的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型依赖于标量或成对判断，无法捕捉人类偏好的多方面性。生产可靠且可扩展的rubrics仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 本文介绍对比Rubric生成(CRG)，通过对比首选和拒绝的响应来推导出硬规则(显式约束)和原则(隐式质量)。通过强制执行preference-label一致性通过拒绝抽样删除噪声rubrics，进一步提高可靠性。

Result: 在多个reward-modeling benchmarks上，本文的基于rubric的奖励模型Rubric-RM，超过了强大的size-matched baselines 6.8%。

Conclusion: Rubrics提供可扩展的对齐信号，缩小了昂贵的人工评估和自动奖励建模之间的差距，为LLM对齐启用了一种新的原则驱动的范例。

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

### [32] [Parallel Test-Time Scaling for Latent Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07745)
*Runyang You,Yongqi Li,Meng Liu,Wenjie Wang,Liqiang Nie,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何对潜在推理模型进行并行测试时缩放(TTS)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的潜在推理模型缺乏在连续空间中的采样机制和用于高级轨迹聚合的概率信号，因此无法受益于并行TTS。

Method: 本文提出了两种受不确定性启发的随机策略：蒙特卡洛Dropout和加性高斯噪声，用于采样。此外，还设计了一个潜在奖励模型(LatentRM)，通过逐步对比目标进行训练，以对潜在推理进行评分和指导。

Result: 实验表明，两种采样策略都可以有效地进行计算扩展，并表现出不同的探索动态，而LatentRM可以实现有效的轨迹选择。

Conclusion: 本文为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了一个新的方向。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在回答问题前先进行推理，但在只提供选项的情况下，它们也能成功回答多项选择题，这引发了对它们是否真正理解问题的担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究表明，大型语言模型在没有问题的情况下仅凭选项就能成功回答多项选择题，这表明它们可能使用了肤浅的策略。研究旨在通过分析推理过程来探究这些策略的本质。

Method: 研究让具备推理能力的大型语言模型在完整输入和仅选项输入下解决多项选择题，并分析其推理过程。

Result: 测试时推理通常可以提高完整输入的准确性，但在仅选项输入中，只有一半的情况下有效。研究发现，推理轨迹的长度对仅选项输入成功率的影响很小，并且推理轨迹通过了忠实度测试，表明模型使用了推断缺失问题等策略。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了仅凭部分输入成功总是有问题的观点，并讨论了如何利用推理轨迹来区分有问题的数据和问题较少的推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种系统方法，用于自动将非结构化工具集合重构为结构化工具库，以解决工具增强的LLM在领域工具稀缺和工具检索挑战问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具增强的LLM在复杂推理任务中表现出增强的性能，但领域特定工具的稀缺阻碍了其广泛采用。现有方法在从CoT推理轨迹中提取可重用函数来自动创建工具时，面临着严重的可扩展性瓶颈。

Method: 该系统首先生成离散的、特定于任务的工具，并将它们聚类成语义连贯的主题。在每个集群中，引入一个多代理框架来整合分散的功能：一个代码代理重构代码以提取共享逻辑并创建通用的聚合工具，而一个审查代理确保这些聚合工具保持原始集合的完整功能能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了工具检索的准确性和多个推理任务的整体推理性能。此外，随着问题特定工具数量的增加，该方法显示出比基线方法更强的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种自动重构工具集合为结构化工具库的系统方法，有效提高了工具检索准确性和推理性能，并具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于RT-DETR的实时水上目标检测系统，该系统通过增强合成图像来提高小目标的检测性能，并在真实数据上进行严格评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于小目标尺寸和标记的真实RGB数据的限制，水上目标检测面临着严峻的挑战。

Method: 该研究采用RT-DETR，结合多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择以及合成和真实训练样本之间的智能权重。

Result: 该系统保持了实时性能，即使在实际限制下也能提供完整的Python鲁棒水上检测流水线。它还验证了每个模块的贡献，以及系统如何在极端光照或海洋条件下处理故障。

Conclusion: 本文进行了组件分析，以量化每个架构模块的贡献并探索其交互作用。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

TL;DR: 提出了DynamicEval，一个用于评估动态相机运动下文本到视频(T2V)模型的基准，通过系统地策划强调动态相机运动的提示，并结合人工注释的视频对，解决了现有T2V评估基准的两个局限性：缺乏对动态运动的探索和忽略视频级别的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频(T2V)评估基准在动态运动和视频级别评估方面存在局限性。

Method: 1. 提出了DynamicEval基准，包含强调动态相机运动的提示和人工注释的视频对。
2. 评估视频质量的两个关键维度：背景场景一致性和前景对象一致性。
3. 提出了新的背景一致性指标，利用对象错误图来纠正Vbench运动平滑度指标的两个失败案例。
4. 引入了前景一致性指标，跟踪每个对象实例中的点及其邻居以评估对象保真度。

Result: 提出的指标在视频级别和模型级别上与人类偏好实现了更强的相关性（提高了2%以上）。

Conclusion: DynamicEval是一个更全面的基准，用于评估动态相机运动下的T2V模型。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RISP的RED扩展方法，用于加速收敛并保持高质量图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法侧重于设计复杂的图像先验以提高重建质量，而将收敛加速留给启发式方法。

Method: RISP结合了重启惯性以实现快速收敛，同时仍然允许基于分数的图像先验以实现高质量重建。证明了RISP比RED具有更快的平稳点收敛速度，而不需要图像先验的凸性。

Result: 实验表明，RISP能够在快速收敛的同时实现高质量的重建。

Conclusion: RISP是一种很有前途的RED扩展方法，它能够在快速收敛的同时实现高质量的重建。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图像净化(IP)策略的创新去噪框架，以解决超低剂量CT(uLDCT)去噪中的数据不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: uLDCT显著降低了辐射暴露，但引入了严重的噪声和伪影，并导致uLDCT和正常剂量CT(NDCT)图像对之间存在明显的空间错位。这给直接应用在合成噪声或对齐数据上训练的现有去噪网络带来了挑战。

Method: 1. 构建真实的临床uLDCT肺部数据集。2. 提出图像净化策略，生成结构对齐的uLDCT-NDCT图像对。3. 提出频域流匹配(FFM)模型。

Result: IP策略显著提高了多个主流去噪模型在uLDCT任务上的性能。FFM模型结合IP策略在解剖结构保持方面达到了最先进(SOTA)的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决真实世界uLDCT去噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

Motivation: 随着生成模型使用的增长，确保内容归属和来源的水印方法的需求也日益增加。现有的语义水印方案在资源受限的对抗环境中仍然脆弱。

Method: 该论文提出了一种名为D2RA的免训练、单图像攻击方法。该方法通过将水印图像投影到互补表示上的自然先验来抑制水印信号，同时保持视觉保真度。

Result: 实验结果表明，D2RA能够持续降低水印的可检测性，揭示了当前水印设计的根本弱点。

Conclusion: 当前的水印方案存在根本性的弱点，D2RA攻击可以有效降低水印可检测性。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合 LayoutLMv3 和 GPT-4o 的方法，用于从历史地图图例中提取符号及其描述，以提高地图的可搜索性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图图例对于理解地图符号至关重要，但其不一致的布局和非结构化格式使得自动提取具有挑战性。现有方法主要集中在分割或通用 OCR 上，很少有方法能有效地将图例符号与其描述进行结构化匹配。

Method: 该方法结合了 LayoutLMv3 进行布局检测，并使用带有上下文学习的 GPT-4o，通过边界框预测来检测和链接图例项目及其描述。

Result: 实验表明，使用结构化 JSON 提示的 GPT-4 优于基线，实现了 88% 的 F-1 值和 85% 的 IoU。同时揭示了提示设计、示例数量和布局对齐如何影响性能。

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展的、布局感知的图例解析，并提高了各种视觉风格的历史地图的索引和可搜索性。

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PickStyle的视频风格迁移框架，该框架利用预训练的视频扩散模型，并结合风格适配器，通过静态图像数据进行训练，以实现视频风格的转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频风格迁移任务缺乏成对的视频数据进行监督。

Method: 该方法通过在条件模块的自注意力层中插入低秩适配器，实现运动风格迁移；通过应用共享增强来构建合成训练片段，模拟相机运动，确保时间先验被保留；引入了Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG)，将无分类器引导分解为独立的文本（风格）和视频（上下文）方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在时间一致性、风格保真度和内容保持方面均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了时域连贯、风格准确、内容保留的视频转换。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了视频生成模型在物理真实性方面的不足，并提出了TRAVL和ImplausiBench来解决和评估这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成模型经常违反物理规律，且缺乏可靠的定量评估方法。

Method: 通过微调视频-语言模型(VLMs)，结合平衡的训练数据集和轨迹感知的注意力模块，来提高VLMs的运动编码和识别能力。

Result: 现有的VLMs难以识别物理违规，TRAVL可以有效提升VLMs的物理合理性判断能力。

Conclusion: TRAVL和ImplausiBench提供了一个统一的框架，用于探索和提高多模态模型中的物理合理性。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用语义光谱空间融合网络 (S3FN)，该网络使用上下文相关的、特定于类别的文本描述来补充 HSI 分类模型的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量训练样本的有限性和光谱数据的高维度，HSI 分类模型容易出现过拟合，并且经常面临平衡准确性和计算复杂性的挑战。此外，大多数 HSI 分类模型是单模态的，它们仅依赖于光谱空间数据来学习高维嵌入空间中的决策边界。

Method: S3FN 利用 LLM 为每个类别标签生成全面的文本描述，捕捉其独特的特征和光谱行为。然后，使用预训练的文本编码器（如 BERT 或 RoBERTa）将这些描述嵌入到向量空间中，以提取有意义的标签语义，从而实现更好的特征-标签对齐，从而提高分类性能。

Result: 在三个不同的 HSI 基准数据集（Hyperspectral Wood、HyperspectralBlueberries 和 DeepHS-Fruit）上评估了该模型，并报告了显着的性能提升。

Conclusion: 结果突出了文本语义和光谱空间数据之间的协同作用，为语义增强的 HSI 分类模型的进一步发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [44] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种针对视觉语言模型（VLM）的轻量级且高效的 machine unlearning 框架，名为 Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL)，用于解决 VLM 在 VQA 任务中可能存在的隐私泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练的视觉语言模型（VLM）在多模态理解和推理任务（如视觉问答 VQA）中表现出强大的能力，但同时也可能在训练过程中记忆并泄露私有和/或敏感信息。现有的 machine unlearning 方法主要集中在语言模型（LLM）上，而 VLM 的视觉上下文也可能包含敏感信息，增加了 unlearning 的复杂性。

Method: 该方法利用跨模态注意力机制，探索视觉 tokens 在 VLM 输出生成中的作用，并据此制定 CAGUL 框架。CAGUL 使用外部模块对低重要性的视觉 tokens 进行编码，从而在相关查询中隐藏 unlearning 信息。这种方法无需改变预训练模型参数，也无需重新训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，CAGUL 方法在防止隐私泄露的同时，还能保留参考模型的行为。其性能优于或等同于基于微调的基线方法，且无需改变预训练模型参数或产生重新训练的成本。

Conclusion: CAGUL 是一种实用且有效的 VLM unlearning 解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaSC是一种使用低成本无人机RGB图像自动统计玉米幼苗数量的算法，它基于YOLOv9模型，区分玉米和杂草，并进行行和范围分割以生成精确的逐行统计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工计数劳动强度大、速度慢且容易出错，尤其是在大型或可变田地中。因此，需要一种自动化的玉米幼苗计数方法。

Method: MaSC算法使用轻量级的YOLOv9模型来检测V2-V10生长阶段的玉米幼苗，并通过空间分布进行行和范围分割。

Result: 在2024年夏季苗圃的实地人工计数评估中，MaSC与地面实况非常吻合（镶嵌图的R^2=0.616，原始帧的R^2=0.906）。MaSC在60.63秒内处理了83个全分辨率帧。

Conclusion: MaSC是一种可扩展、低成本且准确的工具，可用于研究和生产环境中自动化的玉米幼苗计数。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

TL;DR: CapsNet在MNIST数据集上表现出色，但速度慢。本文提出了Quick-CapsNet (QCN)，它通过减少capsule的数量来加速，但精度略有下降。在MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上，推理速度提高了5倍。还通过使用更强大的解码器进一步增强了QCN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet速度慢，限制了其在需要快速网络的应用程序中的应用，特别是在推理过程中。

Method: 提出了Quick-CapsNet (QCN)，它通过减少capsule的数量来加速。

Result: 在MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上，推理速度提高了5倍，但精度略有下降。通过使用更强大的解码器进一步增强了QCN。

Conclusion: Quick-CapsNet (QCN)是一种快速的CapsNet替代方案，可以作为开发快速实时CapsNet的起点。

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的 classifier-free guidance 方法，用于 rectified flow 模型，以解决现有方法中的 off-manifold drift 问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 classifier-free guidance 方法应用于 rectified flow 模型时，会产生严重的 off-manifold drift，导致视觉伪影、文本错位和不稳定行为。

Method: 提出 Rectified-CFG++，这是一种自适应的 predictor-corrector guidance 方法，它将 rectified flow 的确定性效率与 geometry-aware conditioning 规则相结合。每个推理步骤首先执行一个条件 RF 更新，将样本锚定在学习的传输路径附近，然后应用加权条件校正，该校正在条件和无条件速度场之间进行插值。

Result: 在大型文本到图像模型（Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina）上的大量实验表明，Rectified-CFG++ 在 MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic 和 T2I-CompBench 等基准数据集上始终优于标准 CFG。

Conclusion: 提出的 Rectified-CFG++ 方法可以有效地解决 rectified flow 模型中的 off-manifold drift 问题，并在文本到图像生成任务中取得更好的性能。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像和视频质量评估领域的大型多模态模型（LMMs）的进展尚未在3D资产领域得到充分探索。本文旨在利用这些模型进行NR-PCQA，自动评估点云的感知质量。

Method: 该方法利用文本描述、2D投影和3D点云视图等不同模态的数据，构建了一个能够端到端处理文本、图像和点云以预测质量分数的LMM——PIT-QMM。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在常用基准测试中显著优于现有技术，且训练迭代次数更少。该框架还支持失真定位和识别。

Conclusion: 该研究为模型的可解释性和交互性开辟了一条新道路。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 现有方法主要集中于单流方法，而本文旨在通过引入学习到的动作特征的双流方法来提高动作分割性能。

Method: 提出了双流对齐网络（DSA Net），包含时间上下文（TC）块，使用交叉注意力和基于量子的动作引导调制（Q-ActGM）融合信息，并设计了双流对齐损失，包含关系一致性、跨层对比和循环一致性重建损失。

Result: DSA Net在GTEA、Breakfast、50Salads和EgoProcel等数据集上取得了state-of-the-art的性能。

Conclusion: 通过实验证明了DSA Net的有效性，并通过消融实验验证了各个组件的有效性。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视频虚拟试穿方法OIE，该方法基于首帧服装替换，通过图像的服装迁移模型替换初始帧中的服装，然后在编辑后的首帧的内容控制下，利用姿势和mask信息来引导视频生成模型的时间 prior，从而合成剩余帧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的双分支结构在基于U-Net的扩散模型中取得了显著成功，但将其应用于基于扩散 Transformer 的扩散模型仍然具有挑战性。服装参考分支的潜在空间特征需要添加或修改骨干网络，导致大量可训练参数。服装的潜在空间特征缺乏固有的时间特性，因此需要额外的学习。

Method: 采用基于首帧服装替换的虚拟试穿策略OIE，具体而言，使用基于图像的服装迁移模型替换初始帧中的服装，然后在编辑后的首帧的内容控制下，利用姿势和mask信息来引导视频生成模型的时间 prior，从而合成剩余帧。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持领先性能的同时，实现了卓越的参数效率和计算效率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的OIE方法在视频虚拟试穿任务中具有优势，能够在保证性能的同时，提高参数效率和计算效率。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化diffusion模型容易过度拟合主题图像，忽略文本提示。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter自动生成mask，在第二遍处理时屏蔽背景图像token，仅保留主题。

Result: 该方法在生成包含地点和位置的图像时，能更准确地根据文本提示描绘主题。

Conclusion: 该方法在提示和源图像对齐方面表现出色。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

Method: 研究比较了标准Transformer模型、小型视觉语言模型(Phi3.5-vision)、大型预训练VLM(Gemini)以及处理多张图像的扩展Transformer。

Result: 在Crello数据集上的评估表明，标准的基于Transformer的模型通常优于基于VLM的方法，尤其是在结合更丰富的外观信息时。然而，所有方法在处理非常小的文本或人口稠密的布局时都面临挑战。

Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models
generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating

small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits
of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为阈值控制迭代金字塔 (TCIP) 的新型医学图像配准模型，该模型优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像配准中表现出卓越的性能，但它们的解码器架构本身容易传播和累积解剖结构错位。此外，大多数现有模型无法自适应地确定在不同图像的不同变形要求下进行优化的迭代次数，从而导致过早终止或过度迭代，从而降低配准精度。

Method: 提出了特征增强残差模块 (FERM) 作为金字塔网络中每个解码层的核心组件，并提出了双阶段阈值控制迭代 (TCI) 策略来自适应地确定不同图像的迭代次数。

Result: 在三个公共脑 MRI 数据集和一个腹部 CT 数据集上的大量实验表明，TCIP 在准确性方面优于最先进 (SOTA) 的配准网络，同时保持了可比的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数大小。

Conclusion: 通过将 FERM 和 TCI 与现有的配准网络集成，并进一步进行消融研究，验证了这两种所提出的方法的有效性，从而评估了 FERM 和 TCI 的通用性。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成具有高可控性的指定元素，同时保持未指定元素的多样性，并在可控性、多样性和 3D 一致性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的哈希互学习框架(MLH)，通过从较弱的pairwise-based分支传递知识来增强center-based哈希分支。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度哈希方法要么只关注局部相似性，要么只关注全局数据分布，忽略了局部相似性的重要信息。

Method: 包含一个强的center-based分支和一个弱的pairwise-based分支，通过迭代互学习过程，center-based分支利用pairwise-based分支学习到的局部相似性线索。此外，引入了一种新的混合哈希专家模块，以实现有效的跨分支交互。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，MLH始终优于state-of-the-art的哈希方法。

Conclusion: MLH方法有效地结合了局部相似性和全局数据分布，提高了哈希检索的性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Repainter的强化学习框架，用于移除电商平台产品图像中的水印和促销文字等干扰元素，并生成清晰美观的产品图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商平台上的产品图像通常包含水印和促销文字等干扰元素，影响用户体验和广告效果。现有的diffusion-based inpainting方法在商业环境中表现不佳，存在物体移除不稳定和领域适应性有限的问题。

Method: 该论文提出的Repainter框架集成了空间抠图轨迹细化和Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)。通过调整注意力机制来强调背景上下文，生成更高奖励的样本，并减少不必要的物体插入。同时，引入了一种综合奖励机制，平衡全局、局部和语义约束，有效减少视觉伪影和奖励漏洞。

Result: 实验结果表明，Repainter显著优于现有方法，尤其是在具有复杂构图的场景中。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的电商图像修复框架Repainter，可以显著提升产品图像的质量和用户体验。

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

TL;DR: SyncHuman: Combines 2D multiview and 3D native generative models for high-quality 3D human reconstruction from a single image, even with challenging poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photorealistic 3D human reconstruction from a single image is challenging due to ambiguities and occlusions. Existing methods using SMPL estimation struggle with inaccurate 3D priors and fine details.

Method: Proposes SyncHuman, which combines a 2D multiview generative model and a 3D native generative model with pixel-aligned 2D-3D synchronization attention. A feature injection mechanism lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto 3D shapes.

Result: SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D human reconstruction, even for challenging poses, outperforming baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: SyncHuman demonstrates a promising direction for future 3D generation models by integrating 2D and 3D generative models.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ComGS: a 3D object-scene composition framework using Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining objects and scenes with Gaussian Splatting is challenging due to baked appearance and shadow information. Existing methods are inefficient or struggle with complex lighting.

Method: Introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) for efficient relightable object reconstruction and focus on environment lighting at the object's placement for lighting estimation, using a diffusion model to complete the lighting.

Result: Achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for editing.

Conclusion: Proposes ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

### [60] [UltraLED: Learning to See Everything in Ultra-High Dynamic Range Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07741)
*Yuang Meng,Xin Jin,Lina Lei,Chun-Le Guo,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为UltraLED的框架，用于从单张短曝光RAW图像中重建超高动态范围(UHDR)场景，解决了传统方法中存在的对齐和鬼影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在UHDR场景中，由于明暗区域曝光差异大，传统方法难以同时保留高光和阴影细节。RGB图像的包围曝光方法容易产生对齐和鬼影伪影。因此，作者希望仅使用单张短曝光RAW图像来重建UHDR场景。

Method: 该框架包括两个阶段：首先通过比例图进行曝光校正以平衡动态范围，然后使用亮度感知的RAW去噪器来增强暗区细节恢复。此外，作者设计了一个9档包围曝光流程来合成真实的UHDR图像，并构建了一个相应的数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，UltraLED明显优于现有的单帧方法。

Conclusion: UltraLED框架能够有效地从单张短曝光RAW图像中重建UHDR场景，并且在动态场景中表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架，利用低帧率RGB视频和高帧率事件流共同优化动态3D高斯溅射（3DGS）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从低帧率RGB视频重建动态3DGS具有挑战性，因为帧间大运动会增加解空间的不确定性。事件相机可以异步捕获快速视觉变化并且对运动模糊具有鲁棒性，但它们不提供颜色信息。将低时间分辨率图像与高帧率事件流结合可以应对这一挑战。

Method: 该方法采用事件运动先验来指导变形场的优化。首先，使用LoCM无监督微调框架提取事件流中编码的运动先验，以使事件流估计器适应特定的未见场景。然后，提出了一种几何感知数据关联方法来构建事件-高斯运动对应关系，这是管道的主要基础，并伴随两种有用的策略，即运动分解和帧间伪标签。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在合成和真实场景中优于现有的基于图像和事件的方法，并证明该方法可以在事件数据的帮助下有效地优化动态3DGS。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种利用事件数据优化动态3DGS的有效方法，并在合成和真实场景中取得了优于现有方法的结果。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Motivation: 研究的目的是提高脑肿瘤分割的准确性，并提高医生对模型的信任度。

Method: 研究使用了 UNet、ResUNet 和 AttUNet 三种深度学习模型，并结合 Grad-CAM 和基于注意力的可视化 XAI 技术。

Result: ResUNet 在 Dice 和 Jaccard 相似性评分以及准确率、召回率和 F1 分数方面优于其他模型。

Conclusion: ResUNet 是性能最好的模型，建议将其用于未来的临床评估中的自动脑肿瘤分割。

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时空基准测试无法评估视觉语言模型在图像/视频和图形上下文中的地理时空智能，这对于交通管理和应急响应等领域非常重要。

Method: 引入 GTR-Bench，这是一个用于大规模相机网络中移动目标地理时间推理的新挑战。

Result: 在 GTR-Bench 上对 10 多个流行的视觉语言模型进行评估表明，即使是最好的专有模型 Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%) 在地理时间推理方面也显着落后于人类的表现 (78.61%)。

Conclusion: GTR-Bench 揭示了当前模型在地理时空推理方面的三个主要缺陷：空间-时间上下文利用不平衡，时间预测能力弱，以及缺乏理解或对齐地图数据与多视图视频输入的能力。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

Result: 在MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, 和 SAMM数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 可学习的双阶段框架在微表情识别方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的深度估计框架，该框架利用房间几何约束来提高深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

Result: ACAVP 在 12 个图像分类数据集上取得了 SOTA 的精度，超过了线性探测的平均精度，并且对分布偏移表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ACAVP 是一种有效的视觉提示方法，它可以在保持最小计算开销的同时，显著提高模型的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14

next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an

3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects

TL;DR: PrismGS: A physically-grounded regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability when scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting to large urban environments, especially under high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering.

Method: Proposes PrismGS, which integrates pyramidal multi-scale supervision and explicit size regularization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around 1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Conclusion: PrismGS improves the rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians by mitigating flickering textures and jagged edges.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Motivation: 连接有听力和言语障碍的人与其他人。这种视频在教育应用和符号提示界面中非常有用。

Method: 结合了基于I3D的特征提取模块、专门的特征转换网络和音频生成管道，利用一种新的非极大值抑制（NMS）算法来对非语法连续序列中的符号进行时间检测。

Result: 在ASL-Citizen-1500和WLASL-100数据集上取得了有竞争力的性能，Top-1 准确率分别为 72.01% 和 78.67%，音频质量指标（PESQ：2.67，STOI：0.73）表明语音输出清晰易懂。

Conclusion: 本文提出的IsoSignVid2Aud框架在孤立符号序列的符号语言视频到语音的翻译任务上表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AlignGS的新框架，用于从稀疏视图中重建室内场景的3D模型，通过结合2D基础模型的语义先验知识，优化几何和语义的一致性，从而实现更准确的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将语义视为被动特征，几何体的缺陷会影响语义的准确性。本文认为语义理解应作为主动的指导力量，以实现稳健的稀疏视图重建。

Method: AlignGS框架利用2D基础模型提取丰富的先验知识，并通过深度一致性和多方面法线正则化等语义到几何的指导机制，直接正则化3D表示。

Result: 在标准benchmark上的大量评估表明，该方法在novel view synthesis方面取得了state-of-the-art的结果，并产生了具有卓越几何精度的重建。

Conclusion: 利用语义先验作为几何正则化器可以从有限的输入视图中生成更连贯和完整的3D模型。

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test
large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated

challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context
of the TOXBOX project.

Motivation: 现有的前馈重建范例在重建驾驶场景时，由于固定视角变换和稀疏视角之间的重叠区域小等问题，泛化能力和重建精度受到限制。

Method: 该方法基于统一的圆柱体提升方法，包括相机建模和特征提升。通过设计统一的圆柱体相机建模策略（UCCM）来避免学习视角相关的空间对应关系，并利用新设计的圆柱平面特征组（CPFG）的混合表示来将2D图像特征提升到3D空间。

Result: 实验结果表明，XYZCylinder在不同的评估设置下取得了state-of-the-art的性能，并且可以以zero-shot的方式推广到其他驾驶场景。

Conclusion: XYZCylinder模型有效地解决了驾驶场景重建中的泛化能力和重建精度问题，并在实验中取得了优异的表现。

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的token压缩方法，用于降低视频视觉语言模型的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理视频时计算成本高昂，而现有的token压缩方法会导致信息丢失和性能下降。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为MARC的方法，该方法结合了结构化检索和基于强化学习的蒸馏，使用VMR选择关键片段，并使用C-GRPO框架将推理能力从教师模型提炼到学生模型。

Result: 在六个视频基准测试中，MARC仅使用一个帧的token就实现了接近基线的准确率，并将视觉token减少了95％，GPU内存减少了72％，延迟减少了23.9％。

Conclusion: MARC具有在视频问答、监控和自动驾驶等资源受限环境中实现高效、实时视频理解的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有的异常检测应用受到异常样本有限和人工标注成本高的限制。现有的研究主要将异常合成作为异常检测框架中的辅助组成部分，缺乏对异常合成算法的系统评估，并且忽略了异常合成的关键因素，例如将其影响与检测分离，定量分析合成数据以及跨不同场景的适应性。

Method: 提出了ASBench，这是一个专门用于评估异常合成方法的综合基准测试框架。该框架引入了四个关键评估维度：（i）跨不同数据集和管道的泛化性能；（ii）合成数据与真实数据的比率；（iii）合成图像的内在指标与异常检测性能指标之间的相关性；（iv）混合异常合成方法策略。

Conclusion: ASBench是一个全面的基准测试框架，专门用于评估异常合成方法，可以有效地揭示当前方法的局限性，并为未来的研究方向提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

Motivation: 现有的视频基础模型在组合场景（例如，运动、数字和空间关系）中表现不佳。

Method: 引入Test-Time Optimization and Memorization (TTOM)框架，通过一个通用的布局-注意力目标来整合和优化新参数，并结合参数化记忆机制来支持灵活的操作。

Result: TTOM能够解耦组合世界知识，展现出强大的可转移性和泛化性。在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试上的实验结果表明，TTOM是一个有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，能够即时实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: TTOM框架通过在推理时对齐视频生成模型的输出与时空布局，显著提升了模型在组合场景下的性能，并在多个基准测试中取得了优异的结果。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为 Latent Harmony 的两阶段框架，该框架重新定义了用于 UHD 修复的 VAE，通过联合正则化潜在空间和强制执行高频感知重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHD 图像修复面临计算效率和高频细节保留之间的权衡。虽然 VAE 通过潜在空间处理提高了效率，但它们的高斯约束通常会丢弃特定于退化的高频信息，从而损害重建保真度。

Method: 第一阶段引入 LH-VAE，通过视觉语义约束和渐进式退化扰动来增强语义鲁棒性，而潜在等方差加强了高频重建。第二阶段使用高频低秩自适应 (HF-LoRA) 联合训练这个改进的 VAE 和修复模型：一个由面向保真度的高频对齐损失引导的编码器 LoRA 以恢复真实的细节，以及一个由面向感知的损失驱动的解码器 LoRA 以合成逼真的纹理。

Result: 实验表明，Latent Harmony 在 UHD 和标准分辨率任务中实现了最先进的性能，有效地平衡了效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: Latent Harmony 有效地平衡了效率、感知质量和重建精度，并在 UHD 和标准分辨率任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

Motivation: 研究图像隐私分类任务中哪种类型的标签更合适，因为图像隐私分类是一项依赖上下文且主观的任务。

Method: 对比对象标签和抽象标签在不同标签数量下的图像隐私分类效果。

Result: 当标签预算有限时，抽象标签更有效；当每个图像有大量标签可用时，与对象相关的信息同样有用。

Conclusion: 研究结果可以指导未来研究，从而开发更准确的图像隐私分类器，并充分考虑标签类型和数量的作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

Motivation: 在低光图像中同时恢复高频细节和抑制严重噪声是一个挑战。SwinIR 性能好但计算成本高。

Method: 比较 SwinIR 和轻量级 CNN 在低光图像增强任务上的性能。

Result: SwinIR 的 PSNR 为 39.03 dB，CNN 的 PSNR 为 37.4 dB。CNN 仅需 10 个 epoch 即可收敛，而 SwinIR 需要 132 个 epoch。CNN 的模型大小比 SwinIR 小 55 倍。

Conclusion: 标准 CNN 能够以更低的计算成本提供接近 SOTA 的结果，适用于资源受限的实际场景。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Motivation: 事件相机具有低延迟和低功耗的优点，适用于便携式电子产品和移动机器人等资源受限的应用。现有的人体姿态估计方法主要使用RGB相机，而事件相机在这方面的研究较少。

Method: 利用事件相机输出的稀疏性，使用基于线的事件表示，并结合图神经网络来估计2D人体姿态。该架构包含一种新的偏移向量学习范例和基于置信度的池化。

Result: 首次将图神经网络应用于事件数据以进行人体姿态估计。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的图神经网络GraphEnet，用于从事件相机数据中估计2D人体姿态，并在资源受限的应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

### [83] [CIR-CoT: Towards Interpretable Composed Image Retrieval via End-to-End Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08003)
*Weihuang Lin,Yiwei Ma,Jiayi Ji,Xiaoshuai Sun,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的端到端检索导向的多模态大型语言模型CIR-CoT，它集成了显式的思维链（CoT）推理，以提高检索的准确性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于视觉-语言模型（VLMs）和多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）的组合图像检索（CIR）方法主要作为“黑盒”运行，缺乏可解释性，并且难以遵循复杂的指令。

Method: 通过强制模型首先生成一个可解释的推理链，CIR-CoT增强了其捕获关键跨模态交互的能力。使用一个三阶段过程（包括标题、推理和结论）创建结构化的CoT注释，并在模型进行微调以生成这种结构化的输出，之后将其最终检索意图编码到专用嵌入中。

Result: CIR-CoT在同领域数据集（FashionIQ，CIRR）上取得了极具竞争力的性能，并在跨领域CIRCO数据集上表现出显著的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CIR-CoT为更有效和值得信赖的检索系统建立了一条新路径。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为真值感知解码 (TAD) 的面向验证的解码方案，该方案使神经语言生成与知识库对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了弥合大规模经验模型和形式验证之间的差距，减少幻觉。

Method: TAD 通过语义格来扩充指令调整系统，这些语义格在解码时运行。

Result: 该方案在不牺牲吞吐量的情况下减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: TAD 为大规模经验模型和形式验证之间架起了一座桥梁。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为L2M-AID的新框架，用于使用LLM驱动的多智能体强化学习实现自主工业防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网(IIoT)的日益集成使关键信息物理系统面临复杂的、多阶段的攻击，而缺乏上下文感知的传统防御无法应对。

Method: 该方法利用大型语言模型(LLM)作为语义桥梁，将大量的非结构化遥测数据转换为丰富的上下文状态表示，使智能体能够推断对手的意图，而不是仅仅匹配模式。这种语义感知的状态使多智能体强化学习(MARL)算法能够学习复杂的合作策略。

Result: 在基准SWaT数据集和基于MITRE ATT&CK for ICS框架生成的新型合成数据集上进行的实验表明，L2M-AID在关键指标上明显优于传统的IDS、深度学习异常检测器和单智能体RL基线，实现了97.2%的检测率，同时将假阳性降低了80%以上，并将响应时间提高了四倍。

Conclusion: L2M-AID在保持物理过程稳定性方面表现出卓越的性能，为保护关键国家基础设施提供了一种强大的新范例。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

TL;DR: 思维语言模型(thinking LM)优于其基础模型(base LM)，但尚不清楚思维模型是学习了全新的推理能力，还是重新利用了基础模型中已存在的推理能力。本文提出了一个混合模型，通过在适当的时间激活基础模型中的推理机制，来引出思维模型水平的推理链，表明思维模型利用了已存在的能力。引入了一种无监督的自下而上的方法，用于揭示思维模型中人类可解释的推理行为。实验表明，该混合模型无需任何权重更新，仅需引导12%的token，即可恢复高达91%的思维模型性能差距。结果表明，预训练阶段模型获得了大部分推理机制，而后续训练则教会了模型在正确的时间高效地部署这些机制。

Motivation: 研究思维模型胜过基础模型的原因，以及思维模型是否学习了全新的推理能力，还是重新利用了基础模型中已存在的推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种混合模型，通过在适当的时间激活基础模型中的推理机制，来引出思维模型水平的推理链。引入了一种无监督的自下而上的方法，用于揭示思维模型中人类可解释的推理行为。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型获得了大部分推理机制，而后续训练则教会了模型在正确的时间高效地部署这些机制。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 主张从静态心理健康诊断评估转向连续的、人工智能驱动的评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态解决方案不适用于动态思维。探讨生成式人工智能如何解决神经心理学中当前的能力限制，从而实现更加个性化和长期的护理路径

Method: 利用人工智能有效地进行频繁的、低层次的患者体验抽样，并促进跨护理路径的诊断协调

Result: 设想未来心理健康护理将受益于连续、丰富和以患者为中心的数据抽样，从而动态适应个体患者的需求和不断变化的状况，从而提高治疗的可及性和有效性

Conclusion: 提出使用心理健康数字孪生 (MHDT) 作为个性化心理健康护理的变革框架

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

TL;DR: ProSEA是一个用于迭代解决问题的多智能体框架，通过探索和计划演进来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型智能体在静态规划和脆弱交互方面存在局限性，无法实现真正的协作或自适应推理。ProSEA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ProSEA采用分层架构，其中Manager Agent协调领域专家Expert Agents，分解任务，并根据失败尝试的结构化反馈进行自适应重新规划。与之前的系统不同，ProSEA智能体不仅报告成功或失败，还报告失败的详细原因和新发现的约束。

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人工反馈，ProSEA也优于最先进的基线，并在需要大量推理的任务中实现了稳健的性能。

Conclusion: ProSEA有潜力成为更透明、自适应和与人类对齐的AI智能体的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合专家框架（如TESTAM）缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式结合，限制了其空间能力。

Method: 引入了一种新颖的空间语义专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动的特征相似性集成。

Result: 在METR LA上实现了1.3%的MAE降低（3.10 vs. 3.14），在PEMS BAY上实现了4.1%的改进（1.65 vs. 1.72）。

Conclusion: 更少、策略性设计的专家优于复杂的多专家集成，以卓越的计算效率为实时部署建立新的最先进的性能。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 LLM 在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，容易出现幻觉或知识泄露。

Method: 该论文提出 TS-Agent，它利用 LLM 进行证据收集和综合，并将统计和结构信息的提取委托给时间序列分析工具。TS-Agent 通过原子算子与原始数字序列交互，记录显式证据日志，并在自我批评和最终质量门的指导下迭代改进其推理。

Result: 实验结果表明，TS-Agent 在理解基准测试中取得了与最先进的 LLM 相当的性能，并在推理任务中取得了显著的改进。

Conclusion: TS-Agent 能够避免多模态对齐训练，保留时间序列的原始形式，确保可解释性和可验证性，并减轻知识泄露或幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 探索LLM在业务流程设计和用户辅助方面的潜力。

Method: 使用未经训练的LLM（如ChatGPT）在零样本设置中，评估其从图像理解BPMN流程模型并回答问题的能力，涵盖语法、逻辑和语义层面。

Result: 发现未经训练的LLM在理解流程模型和回答查询方面有效，但不同LLM的性能在准确性和有效性方面存在差异。LLM在流程分析和优化方面表现出拟人化属性。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为业务流程设计人员和用户的有价值的助手。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Motivation: 医疗智能系统(MIS)日益融入医疗工作流程，但同时也引发了重要的安全和伦理问题。欧盟AI法案将大多数MIS归类为高风险系统，需要正式的风险管理流程，以确保符合可信AI的伦理要求。

Method: 将此问题形式化为约束优化任务，并研究三种解决方法：混合整数规划(MIP)、可满足性(SAT)和约束规划(CP)。使用Minizinc约束建模语言对此优化问题进行建模。

Result: 通过比较实验研究分析了每种方法的性能、表达能力和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 从该方法的局限性出发，提出了将Minizinc模型整合到MIS完整可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的一些 перспектив.

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法虽然在该领域取得了一些成功，但它们通常需要模型训练、参数调整以及在适应数据更新时进行重新训练。大型语言模型 (LLM) 在空间和基于图的推理方面表现出越来越强的能力，因此人们越来越有兴趣探索如何将这些模型应用于地理空间问题。

Method: CompassLLM 采用两阶段流程：搜索阶段，用于识别热门路径；生成阶段，用于在历史轨迹数据中不存在现有路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM 在搜索方面表现出卓越的准确性，在生成方面表现出具有竞争力的性能，同时具有成本效益。

Conclusion: CompassLLM 是一种利用 LLM 解决地理空间问题的有效方法，在热门路径查询方面表现出优异的性能和成本效益。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了多智能体辩论（MAD）中存在的身份偏见问题，发现智能体容易受到身份驱动的奉承和自我偏见的影响，从而损害辩论的可靠性。论文提出了一个框架来减轻和量化身份偏见，通过匿名化响应来减少偏见，并定义了身份偏见系数（IBC）来衡量智能体跟随同伴或自身观点的频率。实验结果表明身份偏见普遍存在，奉承比自我偏见更常见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体辩论系统存在智能体并非中立的问题，它们容易受到身份驱动的奉承和自我偏见的影响，这会降低辩论的可靠性。

Method: 论文将辩论动态形式化为一个身份加权的贝叶斯更新过程，并提出了响应匿名化的方法，通过移除提示中的身份标记，迫使智能体平等地对待自身和他人的观点，从而减少偏见。此外，论文还定义了身份偏见系数（IBC）来量化智能体的偏见程度。

Result: 实验结果表明，身份偏见在多智能体辩论中普遍存在，并且奉承行为比自我偏见更为常见。

Conclusion: 为了确保多智能体辩论系统基于内容而非来源身份进行推理，需要对身份进行“屏蔽”。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in
https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的agent训练范式，即早期经验学习，利用agent自身行为产生的数据进行学习，提升agent的泛化能力和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前agent主要依赖于专家数据的监督微调，泛化能力差，因为专家数据只捕捉到狭窄的场景，agent接触到的环境多样性有限。

Method: 本文研究了使用早期经验数据的两种策略：(1) 隐式世界建模，利用收集的状态将策略置于环境动态中；(2) 自我反思，agent从其次优行为中学习，以改进推理和决策。

Result: 在八个不同的环境中和多个模型家族中进行了评估，结果表明，该方法始终提高有效性和域外泛化能力。在具有可验证奖励的环境中，该方法为后续强化学习提供了强大的基础。

Conclusion: 早期经验学习是模仿学习和完全经验驱动的agent之间的桥梁。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

TL;DR: 提出RECAP，一个混合框架，结合确定性正则表达式和上下文感知大型语言模型（LLM），用于跨13种低资源语言的可扩展PII检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源语言中，由于语言多样性和有限的标注数据，个人身份信息（PII）的检测对于隐私合规至关重要，但仍然具有挑战性。

Method: RECAP的模块化设计支持超过300种实体类型，无需重新训练，使用三阶段细化流程进行消除歧义和过滤。

Result: 使用nervaluate进行基准测试，我们的系统在加权F1得分方面优于微调的NER模型82%，优于零样本LLM 17%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为合规性应用程序中高效的PII检测提供了一种可扩展且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource
locales. RECAP's modular design supports over 300 entity types without
retraining, using a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and
filtering. Benchmarked with nervaluate, our system outperforms fine-tuned NER
models by 82% and zero-shot LLMs by 17% in weighted F1-score. This work offers
a scalable and adaptable solution for efficient PII detection in
compliance-focused applications.

TL;DR: 当前AI评估基准存在数据污染、选择性报告和数据质量控制不足等问题，难以区分真实的AI进步和夸大宣传。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI评估体系存在系统性缺陷，无法保证公平和可信，阻碍了AI的可持续发展。

Method: 提出PeerBench，一个社区治理、受监管的评估蓝图，通过封闭执行、滚动更新的题库和延迟透明性来实现。

Result: 旨在为评估提供途径，以恢复完整性，并提供真正可信的AI进展衡量标准。

Conclusion: 当前放任自由的AI评估方法是不可持续的，需要一个统一、实时和质量控制的基准框架。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentAsk，一个轻量级的澄清模块，通过在agent间消息传递中插入问题来减少错误传播，提高多智能体系统的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于大型语言模型的多智能体系统由于边缘层面的错误累积，性能不如单智能体系统。

Method: AgentAsk包含三个阶段：(i) 从错误跟踪中提取边缘层面的判断策略；(ii) 监督策略以决定何时/什么/谁/如何提问；(iii) 使用E-GRPO进行在线强化学习优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编码基准测试中，AgentAsk始终提高准确性和鲁棒性，同时将开销保持在最低水平（延迟和额外成本均低于5%），接近强大的评估器的性能。

Conclusion: AgentAsk提供了一种可扩展的途径，可以构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统，并贡献了边缘层面错误的分类和链路局部干预的实践方法。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用大型语言模型构建的可追踪和负责的多代理系统，该系统具有清晰的角色、结构化的移交和保存的记录，以便追踪每个步骤中谁做了什么，并在出现问题时分配责任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型构建的顺序多代理系统可以自动执行复杂的软件任务，但由于错误会悄无声息地从一个阶段传递到下一个阶段，因此很难信任它们。

Method: 本文研究了一个可追踪和负责的流水线，即 Planner -> Executor -> Critic 流水线。在三个基准上评估了三个最先进的LLM的八种配置，并分析了错误从哪里开始，如何传播，以及如何修复。

Result: 结果表明：（1）在代理之间增加结构化、负责任的移交，可以显著提高准确性，并防止简单流水线中常见的故障；（2）模型具有明确的特定角色优势和风险（例如，稳定的规划与高方差的评论），我们用修复率和危害率来量化；（3）准确性-成本-延迟的权衡是任务相关的，异构流水线通常是最有效的。

Conclusion: 总的来说，本文为设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测和负责任的多代理系统提供了一种实用的、数据驱动的方法。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 目前对人工智能心理健康解决方案的投资和讨论主要集中在治疗聊天机器人上，但本文认为这可能不是生成式人工智能在心理健康领域最具影响力的应用。

Method: 本文重点介绍了使用生成式人工智能来帮助培训人们提供心理健康服务的关键优势，并提供了一个真实的案例研究，其中生成式人工智能改进了退伍军人互相支持心理健康的培训。

Result: 生成式人工智能可以有效地改进心理健康服务培训。

Conclusion: 我们应该投资于使用生成式人工智能来支持心理健康服务人员的培训。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

TL;DR: 论文提出目前对于AI模型在组合推理能力上的评估可能存在低估，并通过新的评估指标和算法来挖掘和提升模型在这方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明AI模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，但论文认为现有评估指标可能低估了模型的能力。

Method: 1. 提出了一种新的分组匹配得分来更好地利用分组结构，从而揭示模型中隐藏的能力。2. 提出了一种名为Test-Time Matching (TTM) 的迭代自提升算法，无需外部监督即可进一步提升模型性能。

Result: 1. 使用分组匹配得分发现现有模型（如SigLIP-B16和GPT-4.1）的组合推理能力被低估。2. TTM算法在多个数据集上都取得了显著的性能提升，例如SigLIP-B16在MMVP-VLM上超越了GPT-4.1，并在WhatsUp等具有挑战性的数据集上实现了高达85.7%的相对收益。

Conclusion: 论文表明，通过改进评估指标和引入自提升算法，可以显著提高AI模型在组合推理方面的性能，并推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在推荐系统中探索新颖行为的方法，以提高用户长期参与度，同时保证安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在推荐系统中，充分展示新颖行为对于提高用户长期参与度至关重要。现有的离线策略学习方法在新颖行为存在时可能不安全。

Method: 首先，开发了一种名为Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient (Safe OPG) 的模型无关的安全离线策略学习方法。然后，提出了一个名为Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User Exploration的新框架，该框架利用安全边际并在多次部署期间逐渐放宽安全正则化。

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但可能过于保守。Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User Exploration框架能够在保证安全实施推荐系统的同时探索新颖行为。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了在保证推荐系统安全实施的前提下，探索新颖行为。

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

TL;DR: 大型语言和视觉语言模型在多模态环境中自主行动和追求目标的能力有限，尤其是在安全性、连贯性和信任方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估智能体在多模态环境中推理安全性、连贯性和信任的能力。

Method: 引入一个可复现的模拟框架，从安全性改进、不安全活动检测和社会动态三个维度评估智能体，并使用 SocialMetrics 量化行为和结构指标。

Result: 智能体可以检测到直接的多模态矛盾，但通常无法将局部修改与全局安全性对齐，纠正不安全计划的成功率仅为 55%。当与误导性视觉信息配对时，45% 的不安全行为被接受，表明智能体强烈倾向于过度信任图像。

Conclusion: 目前的架构在多模态安全性方面存在关键限制，并提供了一个可复现的平台来研究多模态安全性、连贯性和社会动态。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在线奖励生成方法，该方法通过在线监测STL的因果关系来指导强化学习，克服了稀疏全局奖励导致的不收敛和不稳定的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 在实时和安全关键的网络物理系统（CPS）中，控制综合必须保证生成的策略在不确定和动态条件下满足严格的时序和正确性要求。现有的基于STL的强化学习方法由于奖励稀疏，存在不收敛和训练不稳定的问题。

Method: 提出了一种在线奖励生成方法，该方法在每个控制步骤中，根据STL规范持续监控系统行为，计算定量距离，从而产生反映瞬时状态动态的奖励。此外，还提供了一种因果语义的平滑逼近，使其可微，以便使用深度强化学习方法。

Result: 在Gym环境中进行评估，实验结果表明，该方法优于现有的基于STL引导的强化学习方法，为深度强化学习提供了一个更鲁棒和高效的奖励生成框架。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于在线因果语义的STL引导强化学习方法，可以更有效地生成奖励，提高深度强化学习的性能。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在理解化学任务方面表现出潜力，但尚不清楚这是否反映了真正的化学推理能力。为了解决这个问题，本文构建了一个大规模的专家评估基准。

Method: 本文构建了oMeBench基准测试，并提出了一个动态评估框架oMeS，用于更精确地评估LLM的能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，虽然当前的模型显示出有希望的化学直觉，但它们在正确和一致的多步骤推理方面存在困难。通过使用prompting策略和在我们提出的数据集上微调专用模型，性能比领先的闭源模型提高了50%。

Conclusion: 本文希望oMeBench将为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理奠定坚实的基础。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了论文之间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类和对研究进展的深入理解。

Method: 该方法构建了一个三层（基础、发展和前沿）分层引用图，并结合水平搜索和垂直深度遍历来生成多层次摘要，最后通过多智能体验证来确保一致性、覆盖范围和事实准确性。

Result: 实验表明，SurveyG 优于现有技术水平的框架，生成的综述更全面，并且更好地构建了领域的基础知识分类。

Conclusion: SurveyG 是一种有效的自动综述生成框架，它能够更好地捕捉和利用论文之间的结构和上下文关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent”(MMIA) 的 LLM 驱动架构，通过正式可验证的推理过程确保可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在医学领域显示出前景，但容易出现事实和逻辑错误，这在该高风险领域是不可接受的。

Method: MMIA 递归地将复杂的医学任务分解为原子性的、基于证据的步骤。然后自动审核整个推理链的逻辑连贯性和证据可追溯性，类似于定理证明。MMIA 的一个关键创新是“引导”模式，该模式将经过验证的推理链存储为“定理”。

Result: MMIA 在四个医疗保健管理领域（包括 DRG/DIP 审计和医疗保险裁决）中进行了验证，使用了经过专家验证的基准，错误检测率超过 98%，假阳性率低于 1%，显著优于基线 LLM。RAG 匹配模式预计将处理成本降低约 85%。

Conclusion: MMIA 的可验证推理框架是创建值得信赖、透明且经济高效的 AI 系统的重要一步，使 LLM 技术适用于医学中的关键应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

### [109] [From Noisy to Native: LLM-driven Graph Restoration for Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07762)
*Xiangwei Lv,JinLuan Yang,Wang Lin,Jingyuan Chen,Beishui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的测试时图域自适应 (TT-GDA) 框架，该框架利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 将目标图恢复到类似源域的状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图域自适应 (GDA) 方法严重依赖源域数据，但由于隐私或安全问题，源域数据通常不可用。因此，我们提出了测试时图域自适应 (TT-GDA)。

Method: 我们提出了 GRAIL，它首先将节点表示压缩成紧凑的潜在特征，然后使用图扩散过程来建模图恢复过程。然后，量化模块将恢复的特征编码成离散令牌。在此基础上，对 LLM 进行微调，使其成为生成式恢复器，将“嘈杂的”目标图转换为“原生的”目标图。为了进一步提高恢复质量，我们引入了由专门的对齐和置信度奖励引导的强化学习过程。

Result: 在各种数据集上进行的大量实验证明了我们方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 我们提出了 GRAIL 框架，该框架有效地利用大型语言模型来解决测试时图域自适应问题，并在各种数据集上取得了良好的效果。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的分解框架，称为约束诱导复杂性分析 (ACONIC)，该框架将任务建模为一个约束问题，并利用形式复杂性度量来指导分解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在复杂任务上存在可靠性问题，因为现有的分解方法是启发式的，依赖于代理或手动分解。

Method: 将任务建模为一个约束问题，并利用形式复杂性度量来指导分解。

Result: 在组合 (SATBench) 和 LLM 数据库查询任务 (Spider) 上，通过遵循复杂性度量分解任务，代理可以表现得更好 (10-40 个百分点)。

Conclusion: 通过遵循复杂性度量分解任务，代理可以表现得更好。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的强化学习方法，Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)，旨在提高小型语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法如GRPO存在缺陷：模型的rollout响应上限完全由模型本身决定，无法从全错或全对的样本中获取知识。

Method: 引入外部标准参考答案，当模型无法解决问题时，参考答案提供正确的响应，引导模型朝着明确准确的更新方向发展。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得了出色的结果，相对于基线模型产生了显著的改进。

Conclusion: GCPO通过充分利用每个样本提高了训练效率，并使模型能够在训练期间模仿参考答案的问题解决策略，从而增强了推理的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

*Valerio La Gatta,Dolev Mutzari,Sarit Kraus,VS Subrahmanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC)，用于研究对抗环境中智能体在获取信息和暴露风险之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对抗环境中，智能体需要在获取信息以增强情境感知和暴露自身风险之间进行权衡。

Method: 提出了一种名为SHADOW的多头序列强化学习框架，该框架集成了连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手建模。

Result: 实验结果表明，SHADOW追捕者比六个竞争基线实现了更高的成功率。消融研究证实，时间序列建模和对手建模对于有效的决策至关重要。敏感性分析表明，学习到的策略在不同的通信风险和智能体之间的物理不对称性中具有良好的泛化性。

Conclusion: SHADOW框架能够有效地平衡信息获取和风险暴露，并在对抗环境中实现更好的性能。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CityNav: A hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and coupled dynamics of urban traffic.

Method: Integrates a global traffic allocation agent with local navigation agents and introduces a cooperative reasoning optimization mechanism with a dual-reward structure.

Result: CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation on four real-world road networks.

Conclusion: LLMs can enable scalable, adaptive, and cooperative city-wide traffic navigation.

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our

TL;DR: FinMR是一个高质量、知识密集的多模态数据集，旨在评估专家级金融推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏用于评估金融领域多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的、具有专业知识强度、详细注释和高级推理复杂性的数据集。

Method: 构建了一个包含超过3200个精心策划和专家注释的问答对的数据集，涵盖15个不同的金融主题。

Conclusion: FinMR 作为一个重要的基准工具，用于评估和提升多模态金融推理能力，使其达到专业分析师级别的水平。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning
toward professional analyst-level competence.

TL;DR: Augur是一个完全由LLM驱动的时间序列预测框架，它利用LLM的因果推理来发现和使用协变量之间的有向因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的方法面临着显著的局限性，例如在模型架构中的边缘化角色、依赖于粗糙的统计文本提示以及缺乏可解释性。

Method: Augur使用两阶段的师生架构，其中强大的教师LLM使用启发式搜索和成对因果关系测试从时间序列中推断出有向因果图。然后，一个轻量级的学生代理细化图，并对编码为丰富文本提示的高置信度因果关系进行微调，以执行预测。

Result: 在具有25个基线的真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，Augur实现了具有竞争力的性能和强大的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: Augur框架在时间序列预测中具有竞争力的性能和强大的零样本泛化能力，同时提供了透明、可追溯的关于变量交互的推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法全面评估 DeepResearch 系统的整体性能，尤其是在综合信息、产生见解和呈现连贯发现方面的能力。

Method: 使用 LLM-as-a-Judge 方法，从质量、冗余和事实性三个维度评估研究报告。

Result: 构建了一个包含 100 个查询的标准基准，并评估了四个商业系统，揭示了不同的设计理念和性能权衡。

Conclusion: 为 DeepResearch 从信息助手向智能研究伙伴发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

Method: 本研究结合以人为本和社会技术系统的视角，构建了“有意义的透明度”概念。

Result: 论文提出了“有意义的透明度”概念，旨在让公众能够参与到影响他们生活的人工智能系统中，将理解与行动联系起来。

Conclusion: 有意义的透明度可以帮助人们理解关于他们的决定，并塑造这些决定背后的过程。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Method: 提出FactFin框架，通过反事实扰动促使LLM学习因果驱动因素，包含策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟四个核心组件。

Result: FactFin在样本外泛化能力方面优于所有基线模型，并提供卓越的风险调整后表现。

Conclusion: 该研究系统地量化了LLM金融代理中的信息泄露问题，并提出了FactFin框架来缓解这一问题，实验表明FactFin具有更好的泛化能力和风险调整后表现。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在提供个性化互动方面存在局限性。检索增强生成技术虽然提高了上下文感知能力，但缺乏将上下文信息与用户特定数据相结合的机制。

Method: 该研究基于个性化的统一概念定义，构建了一个框架，该框架集成了持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和不断演变的用户画像。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上使用检索准确率、响应正确率或BertScore等指标评估了该方法。并通过为期五天的初步用户研究，初步了解了用户对感知个性化的反馈。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了初步迹象，表明整合持久记忆和用户画像可以提高基于LLM的代理的适应性和感知个性化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练范式在长尾查询上的泛化能力较差，缺乏细粒度的逐步监督来执行规则对齐的推理，并且反馈稀疏，不足以纠正错误的中间步骤，从而削弱了逻辑一致性并限制了复杂推理场景中的性能。

Method: 引入了淘宝搜索相关性的逐步混合检查强化学习框架（TaoSR-SHE），核心是逐步奖励策略优化（SRPO），这是一种强化学习算法，它利用由高质量生成逐步奖励模型和人工注释的离线验证器混合生成的步骤级别奖励。

Result: 在真实搜索基准上的大量实验表明，TaoSR-SHE 提高了大规模电子商务环境中的推理质量和相关性预测准确性，优于 SFT、DPO、GRPO 和其他基线，同时还增强了解释性和稳健性。

Conclusion: TaoSR-SHE 框架能够有效提升电商搜索中 query-product 的相关性，并在推理质量、预测精度、可解释性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

Result: 实验结果表明，ReInAgent能有效解决信息困境，结果更符合用户偏好。在复杂任务中，ReInAgent的成功率比Mobile-Agent-v2高25%。

Conclusion: ReInAgent通过持续的上下文信息分析和用户-智能体协作，克服了现有方法依赖清晰和静态任务假设的局限性，从而在复杂的现实场景中实现更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

### [124] [Language Models Do Not Embed Numbers Continuously](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08009)
*Alex O. Davies,Roussel Nzoyem,Nirav Ajmeri,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在多大程度上以连续方式对连续值进行建模？


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以前的研究已经调查了大型语言模型如何处理算术任务中的整数以及它们如何表示数值。先前的工作已经发现可以使用语言模型嵌入来重建原始值，但没有评估语言模型是否实际将连续值建模为连续值。

Method: 使用嵌入空间的预期属性，包括线性重构和主成分分析。

Result: 语言模型不仅将数字空间表示为非连续的，而且还引入了显着的噪声。虽然可以高保真度地进行重建，但主成分仅解释了嵌入空间内的一小部分变异。

Conclusion: 这项工作的发现对使用嵌入模型的许多领域都有影响，特别是在高数值精度、大数值或混合符号值很常见的情况下。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

### [125] [PEAR: Phase Entropy Aware Reward for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08026)
*Chen Huang,Wei Lu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR) 的奖励机制，通过在思考阶段惩罚过高的熵，并在最终答案阶段允许适度的探索，从而鼓励模型生成简洁的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型 (LRM) 在复杂的推理任务中表现出色，但生成的链式思考 (CoT) 解释通常过长，包含冗余的推理步骤，从而增加推理成本并降低可用性。控制生成推理的长度而不牺牲准确性仍然是一个开放的挑战。

Method: 提出 Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR)，一种将阶段相关的熵纳入奖励设计的奖励机制。PEAR 在思考阶段惩罚过高的熵，并在最终答案阶段允许适度的探索。

Result: 在四个基准测试中进行的大量实验表明，PEAR 在保持竞争力的准确性的同时，始终如一地减少响应长度。此外，PEAR 在训练分布之外表现出强大的超出分布 (OOD) 鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了模型熵与不同 LRM 中不同推理阶段的响应长度之间存在一致的正相关关系，并通过提出的 PEAR 机制，实现了在不依赖显式长度目标或硬性截断规则的情况下，自适应地控制响应长度。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaoyan Gu,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的参数高效微调方法 AILoRA，它结合了函数感知的非对称低秩先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA方法存在性能欠佳和收敛速度慢等问题。

Method: 通过注入WQ的主成分以保留任务自适应能力，并注入WV的次要成分以保留可泛化的特征表示，从而执行函数感知的初始化。

Result: AILoRA 能够更好地捕捉注意力参数的特殊作用，从而提高微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: AILoRA通过非对称初始化策略，提升了LoRA模块捕捉特定任务信息的能力。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

*Qingyuan Shi,Qingwen Meng,Hao Cheng,Qing Xu,Jianqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LinguaSim is an LLM-based framework that generates realistic, interactive 3D scenarios from natural language descriptions for autonomous vehicle testing and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based scenario generation methods struggle to balance command adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments, often compromising realism by limiting scenarios to 2D or open-loop simulations.

Method: The paper proposes LinguaSim, an LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive 3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback calibration module further refines the generation precision.

Result: LinguaSim can generate scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions; comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces excessive aggressiveness, lowering the crash rate from 46.9% to 6.3%.

Conclusion: LinguaSim facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that enhance safety testing and training by bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop, interactive simulations.

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

*Qingyang Hao,Wenbo Liao,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多条件共形选择（MCCS）算法，扩展了共形选择到多条件场景，实现了有限样本FDR控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大规模数据集中选择高质量候选者在资源受限的应用中至关重要，而现有的共形选择方法仅限于单阈值场景，忽略了多条件选择的实际需求。

Method: 针对合取条件，引入了一种具有区域单调性的新型非共形评分；针对析取条件，采用全局Benjamini-Hochberg（BH）程序。

Result: 大量实验验证了MCCS相对于基线的优越性，以及其在不同条件组合、不同真实世界模态和多任务可扩展性方面的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCCS能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

*Xiaochong Lan,Jie Feng,Yinxing Liu,Xinlei Shi,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AutoQual的基于LLM的代理框架，用于自动发现可解释的特征，以评估在线评论的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖于手工制作的特征，无法跨领域扩展，也无法适应不断发展的内容模式。现代深度学习方法通常产生缺乏可解释性的黑盒模型，并且可能优先考虑语义而不是质量。

Method: AutoQual模仿人类研究过程，通过反思迭代生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现将其操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验。

Result: 在拥有十亿级用户的在线平台上部署了该方法。大规模A/B测试证实了其有效性，用户平均浏览评论数增加了0.79%，评论读者的转化率提高了0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual是一个通用框架，用于将嵌入在数据中的隐性知识转化为显式的、可计算的特征。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个可证明的公平AI框架，该框架通过系统地移除所有敏感信息及其代理来克服当前偏差缓解方法的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏见缓解方法存在局限性。

Method: 1. 使用OWL 2 QL中的本体工程，正式定义敏感属性并通过逻辑推理推断它们的代理，构建一个捕捉偏见模式完整结构的sigma代数G。2. 通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平的表示，生成独立于G的变量，同时最小化L2距离以保持准确性。

Result: 该方法确保了真正的独立性，而不仅仅是去相关。

Conclusion: 通过将偏差建模为sigma代数之间的依赖关系，将本体知识编译成可测量的结构，并使用最优传输作为独特的公平转换，该方法确保了在贷款审批等任务中的完全公平性。其结果是一种可证明且具有数学基础的可信AI方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究调查了语言模型 (LM) 中风险规避的可操纵性 (MoRA)，着眼于性别、不确定性和角色，结果表明，虽然某些 LM 与人类行为具有一定的一致性，但仍存在显着差异，强调需要改进可操纵性的生物中心测量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 负责任的 AI 需要能够有效测量、审计和调整其行为倾向的系统，以防止无意中引导用户做出冒险决策或在风险规避中嵌入隐藏的偏见。由于语言模型 (LM) 越来越多地融入 AI 驱动的决策支持系统中，因此了解它们的风险行为对于其负责任的部署至关重要。

Method: 检查语言模型在不同经济场景中复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险规避的可操纵性。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner 和 Gemini-2.0-flash-lite 等 LM 在一定程度上与人类行为保持一致，但显着差异表明需要改进可操纵性的生物中心测量方法。

Conclusion: AI 设计需要进一步改进，以更好地协调人类和 AI 的风险偏好并加强道德决策。模型设计需要进一步发展，以确保 AI 系统更准确地复制人类的风险偏好，从而提高其在风险管理环境中的有效性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PMFR通过异步知识编排，在保证回复质量的同时，显著降低了开放域对话AI系统的延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在延迟和推理深度之间难以兼顾：轻量级模型速度快但缺乏推理深度，工具增强的ReAct agent通过外部知识增强了事实性，但同步执行导致交互延迟。

Method: PMFR采用时间解耦框架，包含知识充分性评估器、轻量级回复生成器和异步知识改进Agent三个协同组件。

Result: 在TopiOCQA上的评估结果表明，PMFR在保持与重量级同步基线相当的回复质量的同时，实现了95.3%的延迟降低 (23.38s -> 1.09s)。

Conclusion: PMFR优于暴力扩展，能够在维持连续对话流程的同时，逐步丰富知识覆盖。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分评估模型理解和应对复杂、长程场景的能力。

Method: 该方法通过查询组合来激发LRM中的长程推理行为，并构建一个长程推理基准。

Result: 即使是最先进的LRM在R-HORIZON基准测试中也表现出显著的性能下降。使用R-HORIZON构建的数据进行强化学习，可以显著提高模型在多步推理任务中的性能。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON是一种可扩展、可控且低成本的范例，可用于增强和评估LRM的长程推理能力。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

Motivation: 多云计算系统在确保可接受的性能并同时满足租户预算要求方面面临重大挑战。

Method: TCDRM 采用启发式副本放置算法，该算法利用多个云提供商的不同定价结构，并根据响应时间、租户经济预算和数据流行度的预定义阈值动态创建数据副本。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法有效地满足了租户的性能目标，同时遵守了其经济约束。与非复制方法相比，带宽消耗最多减少了 78%，复杂查询的平均响应时间减少了 51%，同时遵守租户预算限制。

Conclusion: 所提出的 TCDRM 策略能够利用多云环境提供的功能，在不超出租户预算的情况下保持所需的性能。

Abstract: Multi-cloud computing systems face significant challenges in ensuring
acceptable performance while adhering to tenant budget requirements. This paper
proposes a tenant budget-aware (tenant-centric) data replication framework for
Multi-Cloud Computing (TCDRM). The proposed strategy dynamically creates data
replicas based on predefined thresholds for response time, economic budget of
the tenant and data popularity. TCDRM employs a heuristic replica placement
algorithm that leverages the diverse pricing structures of multiple cloud
providers. The TCDRM strategy aims to maintain the required performance without
exceeding the tenant's budget by taking advantage of the capabilities offered
by multicloud environments. The middleware considered acts as an intermediary
between tenants and multiple cloud providers, facilitating intelligent replica
placement decisions. To achieve this, the proposed TCDRM strategy defines
strict thresholds for tenant budget and response time. A performance evaluation
is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the strategy. The results show
that our approach effectively meets tenant performance objectives while
respecting their economic constraints. Bandwidth consumption is reduced by up
to 78% compared to non-replicated approaches, and average response time for
complex queries is decreased by 51%, all while adhering to tenant budget
limitations.

TL;DR: MobilityDuck 是一个 DuckDB 扩展，它集成了 MEOS 库，以在 DuckDB 中提供时空和其他时间数据类型的支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时空数据的分析在移动性分析中变得越来越重要。尽管对移动对象数据库 (MOD) 进行了广泛的研究，但很少有系统可以在生产中使用或足够轻量以进行分析。MobilityDB 是一个值得注意的系统，它使用时空数据扩展了 PostgreSQL，但它也继承了架构的复杂性。

Method: MobilityDuck 利用 DuckDB 的轻量级、柱状、内存可执行属性来提供高效的分析。

Result: 我们使用 BerlinMOD-Hanoi 基准数据集评估 MobilityDuck，并将其性能与 MobilityDB 进行比较。我们的结果表明，MobilityDuck 在受益于 DuckDB 的内存柱状架构的同时，保留了时空查询的表达能力。

Conclusion: MobilityDuck 在内存或嵌入式分析系统中提供了原生的时空类型和连续轨迹运算符。

Abstract: The analytics of spatiotemporal data is increasingly important for mobility
analytics. Despite extensive research on moving object databases (MODs), few
systems are ready on production or lightweight enough for analytics. MobilityDB
is a notable system that extends PostgreSQL with spatiotemporal data, but it
inherits complexity of the architecture as well. In this paper, we present
MobilityDuck, a DuckDB extension that integrates the MEOS library to provide
support spatiotemporal and other temporal data types in DuckDB. MobilityDuck
leverages DuckDB's lightweight, columnar, in-memory executable properties to
deliver efficient analytics. To the best of our knowledge, no existing
in-memory or embedded analytical system offers native spatiotemporal types and
continuous trajectory operators as MobilityDuck does. We evaluate MobilityDuck
using the BerlinMOD-Hanoi benchmark dataset and compare its performance to
MobilityDB. Our results show that MobilityDuck preserves the expressiveness of
spatiotemporal queries while benefiting from DuckDB's in-memory, columnar
architecture.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为 ZeroCard 的新型基数估计方法，该方法不依赖于原始数据、查询日志或目标数据库上的重新训练，并且可以利用模式语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的基数估计方法难以推广到新的数据集，因为它们对原始数据或查询有很强的依赖性，从而限制了它们在实际场景中的实用性。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于模式语义预测数据分布的方法，避免了对原始数据的依赖。此外，还引入了一种与查询模板无关的表示方法，以减轻查询依赖性。最后，构建了一个大型查询数据集，并在此基础上对 ZeroCard 进行预训练。

Result: 大量的实验表明 ZeroCard 具有明显的优势，并展示了其在查询优化中的实际应用。它的零依赖性大大方便了在实际场景中的部署。

Conclusion: 本文提出的 ZeroCard 方法可以有效地解决现有基数估计方法难以泛化的问题，并且具有很强的实用性。

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database systems and plays a
critical role in query optimization. Despite significant advances in
learning-based cardinality estimation methods, most existing approaches remain
difficult to generalize to new datasets due to their strong dependence on raw
data or queries, thus limiting their practicality in real scenarios. To
overcome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit
cardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these
dependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven
cardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw
data access, query logs, or retraining on the target database. Specifically, we
propose to predict data distributions using schema semantics, thereby avoiding
raw data dependence. Then, we introduce a query template-agnostic
representation method to alleviate query dependence. Finally, we construct a
large-scale query dataset derived from real-world tables and pretrain ZeroCard
on it, enabling it to learn cardinality from schema semantics and predicate
representations. After pretraining, ZeroCard's parameters can be frozen and
applied in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate the distinct advantages of ZeroCard and show its practical
applications in query optimization. Its zero-dependence property significantly
facilitates deployment in real-world scenarios.

### [137] [Implementing Semantic Join Operators Efficiently](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08489)
*Immanuel Trummer*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的语义连接算法，该算法通过将来自两个输入表的行批量集成到单个提示中来优化大型语言模型 (LLM) 的使用，以识别匹配的行对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多语义查询处理引擎通过嵌套循环实现语义连接，从而调用 LLM 来评估行对的连接条件，效率低下。

Method: 该论文提出了一种受传统数据库系统中块嵌套循环连接运算符实现启发的算法，该算法集成了来自两个输入表的行批次到单个提示中，并引入了用于优化行批次大小的公式。

Result: 形式分析和实证结果表明，与最近的语义查询处理引擎使用的连接实现相比，所提出的方法显着降低了成本并且表现良好。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法通过批量处理行并优化LLM的输入大小，显著提高了语义连接的效率。

Abstract: Semantic query processing engines often support semantic joins, enabling
users to match rows that satisfy conditions specified in natural language. Such
join conditions can be evaluated using large language models (LLMs) that solve
novel tasks without task-specific training.
  Currently, many semantic query processing engines implement semantic joins
via nested loops, invoking the LLM to evaluate the join condition on row pairs.
Instead, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, inspired by the block nested
loops join operator implementation in traditional database systems. The
proposed algorithm integrates batches of rows from both input tables into a
single prompt. The goal of the LLM invocation is to identify all matching row
pairs in the current input. The paper introduces formulas that can be used to
optimize the size of the row batches, taking into account constraints on the
size of the LLM context window (limiting both input and output size). An
adaptive variant of the proposed algorithm refers to cases in which the size of
the output is difficult to estimate. A formal analysis of asymptotic processing
costs, as well as empirical results, demonstrates that the proposed approach
reduces costs significantly and performs well compared to join implementations
used by recent semantic query processing engines.

### [138] [Reasoning by Exploration: A Unified Approach to Retrieval and Generation over Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07484)
*Haoyu Han,Kai Guo,Harry Shomer,Yu Wang,Yucheng Chu,Hang Li,Li Ma,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 Reasoning by Exploration (RoE) 的新方法，它通过将图推理构建为图探索过程来统一检索和生成，以解决大型语言模型 (LLM) 在结构化图上的推理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常采用检索增强生成 (RAG) 范例，但由于生成过程最终受到检索到的子图的质量和完整性的限制，因此难以忠实地结合图结构。此外，许多高级检索器通常针对训练图进行定制，并且对未见图的泛化能力较差，这限制了它们的实际应用。

Method: RoE 在每个步骤中，LLM 选择要探索的候选节点和边，逐步构建推理路径并生成答案。为了实现有效的探索，RoE 分两个阶段进行训练：在 gold reasoning paths 上进行监督微调 (SFT)，然后进行强化学习 (RL) 以提高探索效率和泛化能力。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，RoE 在基线方法上实现了显着的整体改进，同时也有效地推广到未见图。

Conclusion: 本文提出的 RoE 方法能够有效地解决大型语言模型在结构化图上的推理挑战，并在基准数据集上取得了良好的效果。

Abstract: Reasoning over structured graphs remains a fundamental challenge for Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly when scaling to large graphs. Existing
approaches typically follow the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm:
first retrieving subgraphs relevant to the query and then generating answers
conditioned on the retrieved subgraphs. However, such two-phase pipelines often
struggle to faithfully incorporate graph structure, since the generation
process is ultimately constrained by the quality and completeness of the
retrieved subgraph. Although many advanced retrievers have been proposed
recently to mitigate this issue, they are usually tailored to the training
graphs and generalize poorly to unseen graphs, which limits their practical
applicability. In this work, we propose Reasoning by Exploration (RoE), a novel
approach that unifies retrieval and generation by framing reasoning over graphs
as a process of graph exploration. At each step, the LLM selects candidate
nodes and edges to explore, gradually constructing reasoning paths and
generating answers along the way. To enable effective exploration, RoE is
trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on gold reasoning paths,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration effectiveness
and generalization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RoE
achieves substantial overall improvements over baselines, while also
generalizing effectively to unseen graphs.

*Saeideh Bakhshi,Phuong Mai Nguyen,Robert Schiller,Tiantian Xu,Pawan Kodandapani,Andrew Levine,Cayman Simpson,Qifan Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于内容级别的用户调查反馈指标，称为“保留相关性”，用于评估用户返回平台获取相似内容的意愿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的推荐系统依赖于点击和喜欢等短期互动信号，但这些信号通常嘈杂、稀疏，不足以捕捉用户的长期满意度和留存率。

Method: 通过心理测量方法验证保留相关性，并建立其收敛效度、区分效度和行为效度。开发了一个可用于生产的代理模型，将保留相关性整合到社交媒体平台的多阶段排序系统的最后阶段。

Result: 大规模离线建模表明，在预测次日留存率方面，保留相关性显著优于互动信号和其他调查指标，尤其对于历史互动有限的用户。基于该模型的校准分数调整在提升互动和留存率的同时，减少了低质量内容的曝光。

Conclusion: 提供了一个可扩展的、以用户为中心的解决方案，该方案既促进了平台增长，又改善了用户体验。这项工作对负责任的AI开发具有广泛的意义。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement
signals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these
signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user
satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel
content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users'
intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey
measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets
forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions
and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive
Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent,
discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we
show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals
and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for
users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy
model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage
ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based
on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention,
while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale
A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework
linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production
systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both
platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for
responsible AI development.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为 ISMIE 的信息搜寻框架，用于理解现代信息环境中的信息搜寻过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的信息搜寻模型难以完全捕捉现代信息环境的复杂性。

Method: 通过三个关键概念（组成部分、干预变量和活动）来概念化信息搜寻过程，并使用案例研究分析现有的信息搜寻和信息检索模型。

Result: 展示了现有模型的局限性，并说明了 ISMIE 的必要性。通过对三个紧迫问题的描述，概述了两个研究蓝图：一个以用户为中心、行业驱动的实验设计，用于解决人工智能生成内容的真实性和信任危机；另一个以系统为中心、学术驱动的设计，用于解决多巴胺驱动的内容消费问题。

Conclusion: ISMIE 框架为开发信息搜寻和信息检索模型奠定了基础，以增进对现代信息环境中人机交互和系统设计的理解。

Abstract: The modern information environment (MIE) is increasingly complex, shaped by a
wide range of techniques designed to satisfy users' information needs.
Information seeking (IS) models are effective mechanisms for characterizing
user-system interactions. However, conceptualizing a model that fully captures
the MIE landscape poses a challenge. We argue: Does such a model exist? To
address this, we propose the Information Seeking in Modern Information
Environments (ISMIE) framework as a fundamental step. ISMIE conceptualizes the
information seeking process (ISP) via three key concepts: Components (e.g.,
Information Seeker), Intervening Variables (e.g., Interactive Variables), and
Activities (e.g., Acquiring). Using ISMIE's concepts and employing a case study
based on a common scenario - misinformation dissemination - we analyze six
existing IS and information retrieval (IR) models to illustrate their
limitations and the necessity of ISMIE. We then show how ISMIE serves as an
actionable framework for both characterization and experimental design. We
characterize three pressing issues and then outline two research blueprints: a
user-centric, industry-driven experimental design for the authenticity and
trust crisis to AI-generated content and a system-oriented, academic-driven
design for tackling dopamine-driven content consumption. Our framework offers a
foundation for developing IS and IR models to advance knowledge on
understanding human interactions and system design in MIEs.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视频检索框架，通过聚类文本查询来扩大语义范围，从而增强视频检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要依赖于直接匹配文本查询与视频元数据，无法弥合文本描述与视频内容的多面性之间的语义差距。

Method: 该论文提出了一种独特的聚类机制，该机制对相关查询进行分组，从而使系统能够考虑每个查询的多种解释和细微差别。 此外，还引入了Video-Text Cluster-Attention (VTC-Att) 机制，该机制可以根据视频内容动态调整集群内的焦点，从而确保检索过程强调最相关的文本特征。

Result: 该模型在五个公共数据集上超过了现有的state-of-the-art模型。

Conclusion: 提出的VTC框架有效地提高了视频检索的性能。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video content across various platforms has
highlighted the urgent need for advanced video retrieval systems. Traditional
methods, which primarily depend on directly matching textual queries with video
metadata, often fail to bridge the semantic gap between text descriptions and
the multifaceted nature of video content. This paper introduces a novel
framework, the Video-Text Cluster (VTC), which enhances video retrieval by
clustering text queries to capture a broader semantic scope. We propose a
unique clustering mechanism that groups related queries, enabling our system to
consider multiple interpretations and nuances of each query. This clustering is
further refined by our innovative Sweeper module, which identifies and
mitigates noise within these clusters. Additionally, we introduce the
Video-Text Cluster-Attention (VTC-Att) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts
focus within the clusters based on the video content, ensuring that the
retrieval process emphasizes the most relevant textual features. Further
experiments have demonstrated that our proposed model surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models on five public datasets.

Motivation: RAG虽然增强了大型语言模型，但也容易造成大规模的数据盗用。

Method: 1. 创建了一个新的数据集RPD，用于RAG抄袭检测。2. 开发了一个双层水印系统，在语义和词汇层面嵌入保护，并结合询问者-侦探框架进行检测。

Result: 实验证明该方法在不同的查询量、防御提示和检索参数下有效，并且能够抵抗对抗性规避技术。

Conclusion: 该研究为检索增强人工智能系统中的知识产权保护建立了一个基础框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
mitigating hallucinations and outdated information issues, yet simultaneously
facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this
challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel
dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses
diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in
existing resources. Second, we develop a dual-layered watermarking system that
embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an
interrogator-detective framework that employs statistical hypothesis testing on
accumulated evidence. Extensive experimentation demonstrates our approach's
effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval
parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion
techniques. This work establishes a foundational framework for intellectual
property protection in retrieval-augmented AI systems.

TL;DR: PLUM: A framework adapting LLMs for large-scale recommendation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging LLMs' sequence modeling and knowledge for recommendation systems.

Method: Item tokenization with Semantic IDs, continued pre-training, and task-specific fine-tuning for generative retrieval.

Result: PLUM significantly improves retrieval compared to production models.

Conclusion: PLUM framework is viable for large-scale deployment with enhancements and specific training/inference methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new paradigm of modeling and computation
for information tasks. Recommendation systems are a critical application domain
poised to benefit significantly from the sequence modeling capabilities and
world knowledge inherent in these large models. In this paper, we introduce
PLUM, a framework designed to adapt pre-trained LLMs for industry-scale
recommendation tasks. PLUM consists of item tokenization using Semantic IDs,
continued pre-training (CPT) on domain-specific data, and task-specific
fine-tuning for recommendation objectives. For fine-tuning, we focus
particularly on generative retrieval, where the model is directly trained to
generate Semantic IDs of recommended items based on user context. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on large-scale internal video recommendation
datasets. Our results demonstrate that PLUM achieves substantial improvements
for retrieval compared to a heavily-optimized production model built with large
embedding tables. We also present a scaling study for the model's retrieval
performance, our learnings about CPT, a few enhancements to Semantic IDs, along
with an overview of the training and inference methods that enable launching
this framework to billions of users in YouTube.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于历史的互补推荐方法难以推断主观且因人而异的互补关系。本文着眼于驱动项目组合的潜在使用环境。

Method: 利用大型语言模型生成项目使用场景，并以此为基础构建互补推荐系统。

Result: 大约 85% 的生成场景被认为是合理的，这表明 LLM 可以有效地生成实际的项目使用场景。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可以有效地生成实际的项目使用场景，并可用于构建互补推荐系统。

Abstract: Complementary recommendations suggest combinations of useful items that play
important roles in e-commerce. However, complementary relationships are often
subjective and vary among individuals, making them difficult to infer from
historical data. Unlike conventional history-based methods that rely on
statistical co-occurrence, we focus on the underlying usage context that
motivates item combinations. We hypothesized that people select complementary
items by imagining specific usage scenarios and identifying the needs in such
situations. Based on this idea, we explored the use of large language models
(LLMs) to generate item usage scenarios as a starting point for constructing
complementary recommendation systems. First, we evaluated the plausibility of
LLM-generated scenarios through manual annotation. The results demonstrated
that approximately 85% of the generated scenarios were determined to be
plausible, suggesting that LLMs can effectively generate realistic item usage
scenarios.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces TaoSR-AGRL, a new reinforcement learning framework for query-product relevance prediction in e-commerce search, specifically Taobao. It addresses the limitations of existing methods in handling complex business rules and long-tail queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex business rules and user queries, lacking robust reasoning capacity for long-tail cases. Reinforcement learning approaches also suffer from sparse rewards.

Method: The paper proposes TaoSR-AGRL, which includes Rule-aware Reward Shaping (decomposing relevance judgments into structured rewards) and Adaptive Guided Replay (injecting ground-truth guidance into low-accuracy rollouts).

Result: TaoSR-AGRL outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. It has been deployed in Taobao's main search.

Conclusion: TaoSR-AGRL effectively improves query-product relevance prediction by addressing the challenges of complex rules and long-tail queries through structured rewards and guided replay, leading to successful deployment in a large-scale e-commerce search engine.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and
has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic
understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and
business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative,
reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes
the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning
capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via
reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient
guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these
challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning
framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance.
TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which
decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned
with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which
identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted
ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating
reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on
large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human
evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO
baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence,
and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully
deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of
users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems fail to address document evolution through versioning, leading to low accuracy on version-sensitive questions.

Method: VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change tracking.

Result: VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy on the VersionQA benchmark, outperforming naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%).

Conclusion: The work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive
questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity
checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly
models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to
track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer
tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale
deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and
provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

Second, we design Redapter, a self-adaptive learning algorithm that dynamically
adjusts training each sample's weight based on its reasoning intensity. This
allows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships
between queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple
backbones of varying sizes, all of which achieve superior performance on
reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model
offers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which
significantly outperforms existing text embedding models. We will fully

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的 LTV 预测方法，通过目标分解和重构框架解决分布挑战。

Abstract: For Internet platforms operating real-time bidding (RTB) advertising service,
a comprehensive understanding of user lifetime value (LTV) plays a pivotal role
in optimizing advertisement allocation efficiency and maximizing the return on
investment (ROI) for advertisement sponsors, thereby facilitating growth of
commercialization revenue for the platform. However, the inherent complexity of
user LTV distributions induces significant challenges in accurate LTV
prediction. Existing state-of-the-art works, which primarily focus on directly
learning the LTV distributions through well-designed loss functions, achieve
limited success due to their vulnerability to outliers. In this paper, we
proposed a novel LTV prediction method to address distribution challenges
through an objective decomposition and reconstruction framework. Briefly
speaking, based on the in-app purchase characteristics of mobile gamers, our
model was designed to first predict the number of transactions at specific
prices and then calculate the total payment amount from these intermediate
predictions. Our proposed model was evaluated through experiments on real-world
industrial dataset, and deployed on the TapTap RTB advertising system for
online A/B testing along with the state-of-the-art ZILN model.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

Motivation: 现有的图神经网络架构搜索(GNAS)方法局限于单一模态，忽略了模态异质性，导致攻击预测准确率不高。

Method: 1. 提出了一个模态感知的协同进化(MACC)框架，采用分而治之的范例。
2. 引入了一种模态感知的双轨代理(MADTS)方法，以减少评估成本并加速局部基因进化。

Conclusion: MACC-MGNAS 能够有效提高攻击预测准确率，并降低计算成本。

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 MultiFair 的新方法，用于多模态医学分类，该方法通过双层梯度调制过程解决不平衡和不公平的多模态学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态学习模型通常忽略两个关键挑战：各种数据模态可能学习不均衡，模型可能强调对某些人口群体进行学习，导致不公平的性能。

Method: 提出了一种名为 MultiFair 的新方法，它在数据模态和群体层面上动态地调整关于优化方向和大小的训练梯度。

Result: 在具有不同人口群体的两个多模态医学数据集上进行了广泛的实验。结果表明，MultiFair 优于最先进的多模态学习和公平学习方法。

Conclusion: MultiFair 优于当前方法，因为它解决了多模态医学分类中的不平衡和不公平问题。

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

*Aditya Chakravarty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了两种深度学习模型（GNN-RNN 和 MMST-ViT）在预测作物产量方面的泛化能力，利用 CropNet 数据集在美国1200多个县进行了实验，时间跨度为 2017-2022 年。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在气候变化日益影响农业系统的情况下，准确的作物产量预测对于粮食安全至关重要。虽然深度学习模型在利用卫星和天气数据进行产量预测方面显示出潜力，但它们在地理区域和年份之间的泛化能力仍然未经充分测试。

Method: 论文使用了大规模的 CropNet 数据集，并采用留一集群交叉验证方法，跨越七个 USDA 农场资源区域和年度预测情景，对 GNN-RNN 和 MMST-ViT 模型在现实的分布外 (OOD) 条件下进行了基准测试。

Result: GNN-RNN 在地理转移方面表现出卓越的泛化能力，而 MMST-ViT 在领域内表现良好，但在 OOD 条件下性能急剧下降。GNN-RNN 的训练速度比 MMST-ViT 快 135 倍。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，时空对齐是实现稳健泛化的关键，并强调需要透明的 OOD 评估协议，以确保公平和可靠的、具有气候意识的农业预测。

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MLLM4TS的新框架，通过整合专用视觉分支，利用多模态大型语言模型进行通用时间序列分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多元数据中复杂的时间依赖性和跨通道交互，有效的时间序列数据分析提出了重大挑战。受人类分析师通过视觉检查时间序列以发现隐藏模式的方式的启发，作者提出疑问：结合视觉表示是否可以增强自动时间序列分析？

Method: 该方法将每个时间序列通道渲染为复合图像中水平堆叠的颜色编码折线图，以捕获跨通道的空间依赖性，然后，时间感知视觉补丁对齐策略将视觉补丁与其对应的时间段对齐。MLLM4TS 将来自数值数据的细粒度时间细节与来自视觉表示的全局上下文信息融合，为多模态时间序列分析提供统一的基础。

Result: 在标准基准上的大量实验证明了 MLLM4TS 在预测任务（例如，分类）和生成任务（例如，异常检测和预测）中的有效性。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了将视觉模态与预训练语言模型集成以实现稳健且可泛化的时间序列分析的潜力。

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的CUDA内核生成流程，通过生成和管理高质量的带有推理痕迹的CUDA内核来解决高质量数据稀缺的问题。构建了一个名为ConCuR的数据集，并在此基础上训练了一个名为KernelCoder的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前内核生成面临高质量数据稀缺的挑战，阻碍了监督微调的应用。

Method: 开发了一个生成和管理高质量CUDA内核的流程，该流程基于简洁但信息丰富的推理痕迹可以产生强大的高性能内核。

Result: KernelCoder模型在KernelBench上显著优于现有最佳模型QwQ-32B，并优于所有开源模型和前沿模型，如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标。所提出的流程和指标可以帮助在未来获得更好的内核生成数据。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Encode-Think-Decode (ETD) improves LLM reasoning by iterating over key layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability studies suggest reasoning is concentrated in specific layers.

Method: ETD trains models to iterate over reasoning-relevant layers during mid-training.

Result: ETD improves accuracy on 17 reasoning benchmarks, e.g., +28.4% on GSM8K and +36% on MATH.

Conclusion: Recursive latent reasoning is a simple and effective way to enhance LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究线性上下文bandit问题，其中学习者选择动作以最小化损失，并可以选择付费来观察任何臂的损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在给定的上下文中最小化损失。

Method: 基于带有矩阵几何重采样的有效估计器的Follow-the-Regularized-Leader框架，为这个问题引入了一种计算高效的Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) 算法。

Result: 在对抗性设置中实现了$\\Theta(T^{2/3})$的minimax最优遗憾，同时保证了在（损坏的）随机机制中的多对数遗憾。

Conclusion: 使用为我们考虑的设置量身定制的分析技术，建立在来自 \cite{BOBWhardproblems} 的框架上，为``hard problem''设计 BOBW 算法。

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BaRP的在线路由方法，该方法可以在部署时根据性能/成本权衡进行调整，而无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了高效地使用大型语言模型（LLM），需要自适应路由，但现有路由器在离线训练时假设所有候选模型都有标签，这在部署中并不成立。

Method: BaRP方法将路由问题建模为提示特征和用户偏好向量上的上下文bandit，在训练期间模拟在线反馈设置，并根据每个新提示调整其路由决策。

Result: 实验结果表明，BaRP方法始终优于强大的离线路由器至少12.46%和最大的LLM至少2.45%，并且可以针对未见过的任务进行稳健的泛化。

Conclusion: BaRP方法可以在部署时支持可调整偏好的推理，并优于现有的离线路由方法。

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

TL;DR: 联邦学习可以通过在多个智能体之间分配探索和训练来显著加速强化学习。然而，现有的TD学习算法要达到最优收敛速度，需要依赖未知的参数。本文提出了一种双时间尺度的联邦时间差分学习方法，通过Polyak-Ruppert平均，在平均奖励和折扣设置下，实现了最优的收敛速度，且无需参数调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TD学习算法要达到最优收敛速度，需要依赖未知的参数。

Method: 提出了一种双时间尺度的联邦时间差分学习 (FTD) 方法，采用 Polyak-Ruppert 平均。

Result: 该方法在平均奖励和折扣设置下，实现了最优的收敛速度$\tilde{O}(1/NT)$。

Conclusion: 所提出的 FTD 方法为马尔可夫数据提供了一种无参数方法, 即使在单智能体设置中，结果也是新颖的，并且适用于具有异构环境的联邦学习这一更具挑战性的场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

TL;DR: MoGU: a Mixture-of-Experts framework for time series forecasting that models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution, using variance for gating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve time series forecasting by quantifying forecast uncertainty.

Method: Introduces Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), which uses each expert's estimated variance to determine its contribution to the final prediction.

Result: MoGU outperforms single-expert models and traditional MoE setups on time series forecasting benchmarks, providing well-quantified uncertainties.

Conclusion: MoGU enhances forecast reliability by providing informative uncertainties that correlate with prediction errors.

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从科学文献中提取和标准化药代动力学（PK）信息仍然是计算药理学中的重大挑战，这限制了药物开发中数据驱动模型的可靠性。大型语言模型（LLM）在文本理解和推理方面取得了显著进展，但它们对结构化生物医学数据（如PK表）的适应仍然受到异质性、噪声和领域转移的限制。

Method: 该框架集成了嵌入加权微调和流形感知去噪。

Result: 建立了两个理论结果：(1) 一个相似性加权泛化界，量化了嵌入散度下的适应性能，以及 (2) 一个基于流形的去噪保证，限制了来自噪声或离流形样本的损失贡献。

Conclusion: 该框架为在结构化生物医学环境中微调LLM提供了有原则的基础，并为生物医学和数据密集型科学领域中可靠且可解释的LLM适应提供了数学基础的途径。

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

Motivation: 贝叶斯混合效应回归在分析多组分层数据时非常常见，但贝叶斯推断计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用Transformer神经网络进行贝叶斯后验估计，将计算转移到预训练阶段。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上，metabeta达到了与基于MCMC的参数估计相当的性能，但时间大大缩短。

Conclusion: metabeta是一种高效的贝叶斯混合效应回归方法。

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在设计新材料时，需要设计具有特定所需属性的材料。然而，随着新的设计变量的增加，搜索空间呈指数增长，这使得合成和验证每种材料的属性非常不切实际且耗时。

Method: 使用张量补全作为替代模型。

Result: 实验表明，在搜索空间的有偏抽样中，张量补全优于经典ML方法，例如高斯过程和XGBoost，R^2提高了约5%。此外，张量补全在整个搜索空间的均匀随机抽样中仍然具有可比的性能。

Conclusion: 张量补全可以有效地加速材料设计，特别是在训练数据来自设计空间非均匀随机抽样的情况下。

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

Result: 在27,254名退伍军人计划参与者的数据上进行训练，HEMERA实现了>99%的AUC得分。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持透明的、假设生成的模型，用于个性化肺癌风险评估和早期干预。

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在实际约束下机器生成文本的黑盒检测，其中评分模型可能与未知的源模型不匹配，并且每次输入的对比生成成本很高。

Method: SurpMark 通过量化 surprisal 为可解释的状态，估计测试文本的状态转移矩阵，并通过测试转移和两个固定参考（人类 vs. 机器）之间的广义 Jensen-Shannon (GJS) 差距对其进行评分。

Result: SurpMark 在多个数据集、源模型和场景中始终与基线相匹配或超过基线；实验证实了统计量的渐近正态性，并且消融实验验证了所提出的离散化的有效性。

Conclusion: SurpMark 是一种有效的黑盒检测器，可用于检测机器生成的文本，即使在评分模型与未知源模型不匹配且每次输入对比生成成本很高的情况下。

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

*Shen Dong,Mingxuan Zhang,Pengfei He,Li Ma,Bhavani Thuraisingham,Hui Liu,Yue Xing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为 PEAR 的基准，用于评估基于大型语言模型的多智能体系统 (MAS) 的效用和漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对 MAS 漏洞的全面理解，现有研究通常只检查孤立的攻击面或特定场景。

Method: 本文构建了一个基准 PEAR，用于系统地评估规划器-执行器 MAS 的效用和漏洞。该基准与各种 MAS 架构兼容，但侧重于规划器-执行器结构。

Result: 实验结果表明：(1) 弱规划器比弱执行器对整体任务性能的降低更严重；(2) 记忆模块对规划器至关重要，但对执行器没有影响；(3) 任务性能和鲁棒性之间存在权衡；(4) 针对规划器的攻击特别有效。

Conclusion: 这些发现为提高 MAS 的鲁棒性提供了可操作的见解，并为多智能体环境中的防御奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

Result: 通过收敛分析验证了迭代协同训练在减少分类误差方面的有效性，并建立了一个新的泛化界限，分解和量化了利用未标记多模态数据、促进视图间一致性和保持条件视图独立性所带来的不同优势。

Conclusion: 多模态协同训练是一种结构化的方法，可以开发数据高效且鲁棒的AI系统，从而在动态、真实的环境中有效地进行泛化。

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

*Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Ghasem Farjamnia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于小波变换时频分析的自动睡眠阶段评分框架，用于睡眠紊乱的诊断和管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的睡眠评分方法依赖于手动注释或从脑电信号中提取时域或频域特征，这些方法存在局限性。

Method: 该研究使用连续小波变换（CWT）生成时频图，捕捉与睡眠分期相关的频率带上的瞬态和振荡模式，并结合集成学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的基于小波的表示方法，结合集成学习，实现了 88.37% 的总体准确率和 73.15 的宏平均 F1 分数，优于传统的机器学习方法，并且表现出与最近的深度学习方法相当或更好的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了小波分析在稳健、可解释和临床适用的睡眠阶段分类中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,
and clinically applicable sleep stage classification.

*Madeline Navarro,Andrei Buciulea,Samuel Rey,Antonio G. Marques,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了如何从图平稳节点观测中估计公平图，以避免连接偏向于敏感属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图中的边通常表现出连接特定群体的偏好，这可能加剧甚至导致下游图任务的不公平待遇。

Method: 论文提出了 Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp)，一种基于优化的方法，包含两种变体，用于从平稳图信号中估计公平图。一种变体直接约束偏差，另一种通过限制图频谱中的偏差来隐式地鼓励公平估计。

Result: 论文提供了多种偏差指标来评估给定图的公平性，并在合成和真实世界数据集上评估了 FairSpecTemp 的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文的分析表明，不必为了恢复公平图而牺牲准确性。

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种数值框架，用于构建目标数字孪生 (tDT)，该框架直接模拟完整数字孪生 (DT) 中感兴趣量 (QoI) 的动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决完整数字孪生计算成本高的问题，通过构建tDT来高效预测和分析QoI的长期动态。

Method: 采用基于内存的流图学习 (FML) 来开发 QoI 的数据驱动模型，使用通过重复执行完整 DT 生成的短时轨迹数据。

Result: 数值结果表明，tDT 可以准确地长期预测作用力，同时完全绕过完整的流动模拟。

Conclusion: 构建的tDT是紧凑的动力系统，可以在不知道底层流场的情况下演化这些力。

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

*Lénaïc Chizat,Pierre Marion,Yerkin Yesbay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了dropout在大型神经网络中的作用，发现其作用取决于dropout率、学习率和网络宽度的相对大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解dropout在大型神经网络中的作用，dropout是一种常用的神经网络训练技术，通过在基于梯度的训练的每个步骤中随机停用单元来提高性能。

Method: 研究了具有平均场初始化尺度的两层神经网络上具有dropout的梯度下降的大宽度渐近性。

Result: 获得了丰富的渐近相图，该相图表现出五个不同的非简并相，具体取决于dropout率、学习率和宽度的相对大小。发现dropout的“惩罚”效应仅在使用小到不切实际的学习率时才会持续存在。对于较大的学习率，这种效应消失了，并且在极限情况下，dropout等效于一种“随机几何”技术，其中在计算了前向和后向传递之后，梯度会随机稀疏化。

Conclusion: 结果为重新理解大型神经网络中的dropout奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

Conclusion: 研究结果可用于特定领域的微调和优化策略，以提高LLM的性能和用户满意度。

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance
maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our
findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for
Unsupervised Scenarios), a simple yet effective method to perform model
selection for multiple unsupervised machine learning(ML) tasks such as outlier
detection and clustering. Our intuition behind this work is that a machine
learning pipeline will perform well in a new dataset if it previously worked
well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for
multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

Result: 在为 SymbolicGPT 开发的二元数据集上，将基于扩散的生成方法与基于 SymbolicGPT 的自回归模型进行了比较，使用了等效的编码器和 Transformer 架构。结果表明，扩散生成方法在模型中使用类似的底层架构时，可以提供与自回归生成相当的性能，并且在某些指标上有所改进。

Conclusion: 本文提出的使用基于扩散的生成进行符号回归的方法，与使用类似底层架构的自回归生成相比，可以提供可比的性能，并在某些指标上有所改进，为基于神经网络的符号回归开辟了新的研究机会。

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型通常通过文本与外部环境交互，这导致模型负担过重且需要外部解析器。本文提出将环境交互从语言中解耦，通过扩展动作空间（ExpA）在内部实现，模型可以在不同环境间切换。为了有效探索扩展的动作空间，引入了ExpA强化学习（EARL）与反事实策略优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型与外部环境的交互方式（通过文本）存在不足，模型需要同时处理推理和控制任务，且依赖于外部解析器。

Method: 通过扩展动作空间（ExpA）将环境交互内置于模型内部，允许模型在不同环境间切换。引入ExpA强化学习（EARL）与反事实策略优化，以促进对扩展动作空间的有效探索。

Result: EARL在需要多轮交互和应急规划的任务中优于具有词汇约束动作的强大基线。在基于计算器的多任务学习中表现稳健，并在部分观察排序问题中实现了完美的Sort-4准确率，同时自发现了一种与经典设计竞争的高效算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的ExpA方法和EARL算法能够有效解耦语言和环境交互，提高模型在复杂任务中的性能，并具备自发现高效算法的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

Conclusion: TGM通过启用动态图属性预测和时间驱动的训练范例，开启了全新的研究可能性，为以前不切实际的研究问题打开了大门。

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using

these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

### [180] [DGTEN: A Robust Deep Gaussian based Graph Neural Network for Dynamic Trust Evaluation with Uncertainty-Quantification Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07620)
*Muhammad Usman,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGTEN: A new graph framework for dynamic trust evaluation that combines uncertainty-aware message passing, temporal modeling, and defenses against attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating trust in dynamic graphs is challenging due to changing relationships and potential adversarial manipulation.

Method: DGTEN uses Gaussian distributions for nodes/edges, hybrid positional encoding with attention, and adaptive ensemble coefficient analysis.

Result: DGTEN improves MCC by 10.77% in single-timeslot prediction and 16.41% in cold-start, and up to 11.63% under adversarial attacks on Bitcoin trust networks.

Conclusion: DGTEN is an effective framework for dynamic trust evaluation.

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

TL;DR: 本文对大型语言模型（LLM）的机器学习方法进行了研究，旨在删除不需要的数据，知识和行为，同时保留有用的模型功能。研究表明，当前的评估方法过于狭隘，无法全面捕捉生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的机器学习旨在删除不需要的数据，知识和行为（例如，出于安全，隐私或版权原因），同时保留有用的模型功能。

Method: 本文提出了一种原则性的分类方法，将最近的十二种有状态的机器学习方法分为三个方法学家族：差异驱动优化，表示不对齐和基于拒绝的定向机器学习。在此分类的基础上，重新审视了机器学习有效性（UE），效用保留（UT）和鲁棒性（Rob）的评估，重点关注WMDP基准。

Result: 分析表明，当前以多项选择题（MCQ）准确性为主的评估仅提供了狭隘的视角，通常会夸大成功，而忽略了模型的实际生成行为。为了弥补这一差距，引入了开放式问答（Open-QA）指标，可以更好地捕捉生成性能，并揭示方法家族中固有的UE-UT权衡。

Conclusion: 这项研究希望能够全面回顾LLM的机器学习，并为设计和评估未来的方法提供可操作的指导。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Conclusion: 本文研究了MABNI中遗憾最小化和推理准确性之间的权衡问题，并提出了相应的解决方案。

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

Conclusion: 该研究强调了持续学习中固有的复杂性和权衡，并指出了进一步研究的途径。

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种新的基于流的强化学习方法，用于估计未来的回报分布，并识别具有高回报方差的状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法通常将未来的回报分布简化为单个标量值，而分布强化学习方法则利用回报分布来提供更强的学习信号，并应用于探索和安全强化学习。然而，现有的回报分布估计方法未能充分解决回报分布的细粒度结构以及如何区分具有高回报不确定性的状态以进行决策的问题。

Method: 该论文使用现代的、灵活的基于流的模型来估计完整的回报分布，并通过制定一个新的流匹配目标来生成满足分布贝尔曼方程的概率密度路径。此外，该论文还使用学习到的流模型，利用一个新的流导数ODE来估计不同状态的回报不确定性，并利用这些不确定性信息来优先学习对某些转移的更准确的回报估计。

Result: 在37个基于状态和25个基于图像的基准任务上的实验表明，Value Flows的成功率平均提高了1.3倍。

Conclusion: Value Flows方法在离线和在线到在线的设置中都优于现有方法。

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

Motivation: 半同步联邦学习在梯度聚合和模型聚合策略的优化方面面临挑战，梯度聚合收敛快但波动大，模型聚合稳定但收敛慢且准确性欠佳。

Method: FedQS采用分而治之的策略，将客户端分为四种类型，并根据数据分布特征和可用计算资源自适应地优化其本地训练。

Conclusion: FedQS弥合了半同步联邦学习中聚合策略之间的差距，为稳定、准确和高效的联邦学习提供了一个统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

Motivation: AI电商直播中的数字人需要实时响应以提高用户参与度，但高延迟的大型推理模型(LRM)无法胜任。

Method: 该方法包含两个阶段：1) 通过Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) 将670B的教师LRM提炼成30B的混合专家(MoE)模型(3B active)，降低计算成本。2) 采用基于Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)的强化学习来压缩模型的推理路径，并通过多目标奖励函数平衡正确性、 helpfulness和简洁性。

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

Motivation: 传统GRFs难以建模远距离节点关系，依赖长图随机游走采样。

Method: 通过一种新颖的walk-stitching技术，将几个较短的游走连接起来，减少了对长图随机游走采样的依赖；将GRFs的简单walk终止机制扩展到更广泛的策略，将一般分布应用于游走的长度。

Result: GRFs++继承了长游走提供的近似质量，但效率更高，以短游走的并行计算和矩阵-矩阵乘法代替了长游走的顺序低效采样；提高了图核的近似精度，而不会产生额外的计算成本。

Conclusion: 提供了经验评估来展示所有的声明，并用理论分析来补充结果。

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: DEAS框架有效提升了离线强化学习在复杂、长期任务中的性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 由于LBSN轨迹数据在许多应用中很重要，但获取成本高且存在隐私问题，因此需要生成合成数据。

Method: 该方法使用两阶段的粗到细框架，包括S^2TDiff模型和Coarse2FineNet模型，前者用于学习潜在的运动模式，后者用于生成细粒度的LBSN轨迹。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GeoGen在保真度和效用性方面均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: GeoGen框架能够有效地生成高质量的合成LBSN轨迹数据。

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

TL;DR: 递归 Transformer 通过多次重用参数和迭代隐藏状态来解耦计算深度和参数深度。但是，在匹配的计算下，参数较少的递归模型通常落后于非递归模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究表明，递归模型的性能差距主要有两个瓶颈：无差异计算（核心被迫在每次迭代中采用类似的计算模式）和信息过载（长期存在和瞬时信息必须共存在一个隐藏状态中）。

Method: 为了解决这些问题，论文提出了一种 Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) 方案，该方案将状态管理外部化到一个显式内存缓冲区中，并采用轻量级路由器来动态地多样化跨迭代的计算。

Result: 在 Pythia 套件 (160M-1.4B) 上，MeSH 增强的递归 Transformer 始终优于递归基线，并且在 1.4B 规模上优于其较大的非递归模型，以减少 33% 的非嵌入参数提高了 +1.06% 的平均下游精度。

Conclusion: 该分析将 MeSH 确立为构建更强大的递归模型的可扩展且有原则的架构。

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

Motivation: 现有的 GFM 通常假设集中式访问多域图，这通常由于隐私和机构约束而不可行。联邦图基础模型（FedGFM）解决了这个限制，但其有效性从根本上取决于构建一个强大的全局 codebook，该 codebook 通过整合每个域内相互加强的语义来实现域内连贯性，同时通过保留跨域的异构知识来保持域间多样性。

Method: FedBook 遵循一个两阶段过程：（1）域内协作，其中低频 tokens 通过参考客户端之间语义上更可靠的高频 tokens 来改进，以增强特定于域的连贯性；（2）域间集成，其中客户端贡献通过其 codebook 的语义独特性来加权，从而在全局 GFM 的聚合期间保留跨域多样性。

Result: 在跨多个域和任务的 8 个基准测试中进行的大量实验表明，FedBook 始终优于 21 个基线，包括孤立的监督学习、FL/FGL、集中式 GFM 的联邦适应和 FedGFM 技术。

Conclusion: FedBook 有效地提升了联邦图基础模型的性能，并在多个基准测试中取得了优越的结果。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

Conclusion: Rényi锐度可以有效地提高神经网络的泛化能力。

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多任务学习优化框架VAMO，用于解决在线广告中异构广告商的需求问题，通过对齐训练梯度和验证梯度来优化任务权重，提高泛化能力和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告中，广告商的需求各不相同，导致需要独立优化多个定制的出价任务，这导致计算量大和数据效率低。现有的多任务学习方法泛化能力差。

Method: 提出了Validation-Aligned Multi-task Optimization (VAMO)，该方法基于每个任务的训练梯度与一个保留的验证梯度之间的对齐自适应地分配任务权重。此外，还配备了一个周期性感知的时间模块，并将其与先进的生成式自动出价骨干相结合。

Result: 在模拟和大规模真实广告系统上的大量实验表明，与典型基线相比，该方法始终如一地显着改进。

Conclusion: VAMO方法是有效的。

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无线联邦学习方法，通过分层自适应调制来减少通信延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线联邦学习中，客户端需要通过带宽受限的信道传输高维深度神经网络（DNN）参数，导致通信延迟问题。

Method: 提出了一种分层自适应调制方案，可以自动为不同的DNN层确定最佳调制级别。

Result: 与现有方案相比，该方案最多可节省73.9%的通信延迟。

Conclusion: 该方案通过考虑不同层的贡献度，为节省延迟提供了更大的自由度。

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.
