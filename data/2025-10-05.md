### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个概念学习任务数据集，用于揭示大型语言模型中隐藏的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现语言模型在量词中可能存在向上单调性的偏见，这种偏见在没有概念学习组件的直接提示测试中不太明显。

Method: 使用上下文概念学习实验。

Result: 发现语言模型可能存在向上单调性的偏见。

Conclusion: 上下文概念学习是发现语言模型中隐藏偏见的一种有效方法。

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文倡导一种新的低资源语言NLP范式，即通过对话进行开放式的、交互式的语言发现，而不是依赖静态数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低资源语言的NLP受限于文本语料库的缺乏、标准化的正字法和可扩展的注释流程；大型语言模型的跨语言迁移改进有限，且依赖于海量预收集数据和中心化基础设施，难以惠及弱势群体。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于联合人机不确定性的框架，结合了模型的认知不确定性与人类说话者的犹豫线索和置信度信号，以指导交互、查询选择和记忆保持。

Result: 本文为立场文件，旨在呼吁人们重新思考AI如何与弱势语言中的人类知识互动，从抽取式数据收集转向参与式、协同适应的学习过程。

Conclusion: 本文提倡人机协同的交互式、合作式模型构建，尊重和赋能社区，同时发现和保护世界语言的多样性，这与以人为本的AI原则相符。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文利用大型语言模型评估了美国上市公司的气候信息披露成熟度，揭示了披露与实际行动之间的脱节以及普遍存在的模仿行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化增加了对企业气候信息披露透明度和可比性的需求，但模仿和象征性报告降低了其价值。

Method: 本文构建了一个多维框架，使用针对气候沟通微调的大型语言模型，从828家美国上市公司的可持续发展报告和年度报告中提取叙述性指标，并与公司属性相关联。

Result: 研究结果表明：风险导向的叙述通常与明确的承诺相一致，但量化目标与语调脱节；规模较大和排放较高的公司披露了更多的承诺和行动，但与量化目标不一致；披露风格的广泛相似性表明存在模仿行为。

Conclusion: 研究强调了大型语言模型在ESG叙事分析中的价值，以及加强监管以将承诺与可验证的转型战略联系起来的必要性。

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种兽医专用的大型语言模型(LLM)摘要工具在兽医肿瘤记录数据集上的性能，发现Product 1表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在兽医学领域的应用，目前该领域的研究较少。

Method: 使用基于LLM的评分框架，对三种兽医专用LLM的摘要在五个方面进行评分：事实准确性、完整性、时间顺序、临床相关性和组织性。评估重复三次以评估评分框架的内部一致性。

Result: Product 1的总体性能最佳，事实准确性和时间顺序方面获得了完美的中位数评分。LLM评分器表现出高度的可重复性。

Conclusion: 兽医专用LLM工具非常重要，并且LLM评分是一种可扩展且可重复的方法，可用于评估兽医学中的临床NLP摘要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck是一个使用小型语言模型和实时网络证据的自动事实核查系统，它通过模仿人工流程来实现高准确率和可解释性，同时降低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统依赖大型闭源模型和静态知识库，计算需求高昂且不够透明。ClaimCheck旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ClaimCheck采用透明的、分步骤的验证流程，包括网络搜索查询规划、网络证据检索与总结、证据合成与重新检索以及声明判断评估。每个模块都针对小型LLM进行了优化。

Result: ClaimCheck使用小型Qwen3-4B模型在AVeriTeC数据集上实现了76.4%的准确率，优于使用LLaMA3.1 70B和GPT-4o的先前方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的模块化设计和提示策略可以克服小型LLM的局限性，ClaimCheck证明了这一点，并提供了一个公开演示以促进可访问性和透明性。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学基准测试中表现出色，但可能存在数据污染和问题类型狭窄的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当前基准测试是否能真实反映LLM的数学推理能力。

Method: 引入了一个新的基准测试EEFSUVA，该基准测试来自东欧和前苏联国家的奥林匹克竞赛。

Result: 即使是最先进的LLM，在EEFSUVA上的表现也明显下降。

Conclusion: 更广泛的评估数据集对于全面评估数学推理和指导未来模型开发至关重要。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型应遵循分层指令，但研究表明它们经常忽略系统提示，而强烈服从社会线索。本研究通过大规模数据集，从机制上解释了这些行为发现，揭示了冲突决策信号的编码方式以及社会线索如何影响指令遵循。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在系统指令与用户输入、以及社会线索冲突时的行为模式，并从机制上进行解释。

Method: 线性探测用于分析冲突决策信号的编码位置，直接Logit归因用于揭示内部冲突检测的强度，steering实验用于观察社会线索对指令遵循的影响。

Result: 冲突决策信号早期被编码，系统-用户冲突和社会冲突形成不同的子空间。系统-用户冲突案例中内部冲突检测更强，但只有社会线索能实现一致的冲突解决。社会线索的使用在角色无关的方式上增强了指令遵循。

Conclusion: 研究结果解释了系统指令的脆弱性，并强调了轻量级、对层级敏感的对齐方法的需求。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的文档重排序流程，该流程无需人工标注数据，而是使用大型语言模型（LLM）生成合成查询，并使用基于LLM的分类器来标记正例和难负例，然后使用这些数据对小型transformer模型进行微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在重排序方面表现出色，但计算成本高昂，而微调小型模型依赖于稀缺的手动标注数据。

Method: 使用LLM从领域语料库中生成合成查询，并使用基于LLM的分类器标记正例和难负例，然后使用局部对比估计（LCE）损失，通过对比学习微调小型transformer模型。

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了领域内性能，并能很好地推广到领域外任务。

Conclusion: 通过使用LLM进行数据生成和监督，而不是推理，降低了计算成本，同时保持了强大的重排序能力。

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用PHATE流形分析系统地研究了汉字嵌入中的几何模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过跨七个嵌入模型和八个降维方法的交叉验证，我们观察到内容词的聚类模式和功能词的分支模式。对跨越12个语义领域的1000多个汉字的分析表明，几何复杂性与语义内容相关：有意义的字符表现出丰富的几何多样性，而结构部首则坍缩成紧密的簇。

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析

Result: 内容词的聚类模式和功能词的分支模式。对跨越12个语义领域的1000多个汉字的分析表明，几何复杂性与语义内容相关：有意义的字符表现出丰富的几何多样性，而结构部首则坍缩成紧密的簇。全面的子网络分析（123个短语）证明了从基本字符的系统语义扩展。

Conclusion: 这些发现为支持传统语言理论提供了计算证据，并为语义组织的几何分析建立了一个新的框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [10] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于高风险场景的自动摘要框架，该框架集成了不确定性量化和风险感知机制，以提高鲁棒性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息过载和高风险决策的需求。

Method: 构建了一个基于条件生成的摘要模型，并在生成过程中引入贝叶斯推理来模拟参数空间中的不确定性。使用预测分布熵来测量生成内容的不确定性水平，并应用熵正则化和风险感知损失的联合优化。

Result: 该方法显著提高了高风险应用中摘要的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持了流畅性和语义完整性。

Conclusion: 该研究为可信摘要提供了一个系统性的解决方案，并在方法层面上展示了可扩展性和实用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

### [11] [Benchmark Profiling: Mechanistic Diagnosis of LLM Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01232)
*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为“基准分析 (Benchmark Profiling)”的诊断框架，用于评估基准测试实际衡量的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型的评估依赖于标准基准，但这些基准分数可能夸大模型的真实能力，因为它们掩盖了任务所需的技能组合。缺乏系统方法来验证这些基准是否真正衡量了它们所声称的能力。

Method: 该方法结合了基于梯度的重要性评分和有针对性的参数消融，以计算“能力影响分数 (AIS)”，量化每种能力对模型在给定基准上成功的影响。

Result: 通过对三个指令调整模型在十个广泛使用的基准上进行分析，发现：(1) 大多数基准测试利用多种能力而非单一能力；(2) 具有相似标签的数据集依赖于不同的能力组合；(3) 代码生成基准测试奖励广泛的多技能改进，因此从狭窄的领域特定微调中获得的收益有限；(4) 与任务无关的能力可能会对性能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 基准分析解释了为什么性能提升并不总是转化为用户感知的能力，并为基准审计和模型可解释性提供了一个透明的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了计算社会科学如何保护濒危的文化知识系统，同时围绕文学遗产实现新的集体智慧形式。该方法为以社区为中心的文化保护方法提供了见解，支持数字人文和社会意识计算系统中更广泛的举措。

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

### [13] [LLMRank: Understanding LLM Strengths for Model Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01234)
*Shubham Agrawal,Prasang Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMRank是一个prompt感知的路由框架，它利用从prompt中提取的丰富、人类可读的特征来预测每个模型的效用，从而选择最合适的LLM来优化性能和效率之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部署大型语言模型时，需要在性能和效率之间进行权衡，因此为每个prompt选择最合适的模型是一个挑战。

Method: LLMRank使用在RouterBench上训练的神经排序模型，该模型利用从prompt中提取的包括任务类型、推理模式、复杂性指标、句法线索和来自轻量级代理求解器的信号等特征。

Result: LLMRank实现了高达89.2%的oracle效用，并提供了可解释的特征归因，解释了路由决策。

Conclusion: 特征驱动的路由在高效和透明的LLM部署方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

### [14] [GRPO++: Enhancing Dermatological Reasoning under Low Resource Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01236)
*Ismam Nur Swapnil,Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种资源高效的多阶段方法DermIQ-VLM，用于开发皮肤病学领域的VLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLM在医学图像分析中表现出潜力，但在皮肤病学等复杂领域中，由于数据稀缺和高计算成本，其结构化推理能力受到限制。

Method: 该方法包括：1)改进的GRPO++算法，用于稳定GRPO框架；2)有监督的微调，用于会话能力；3)直接偏好优化(DPO)，利用知识图谱作为专家偏好的可扩展代理，以减轻事实错误。

Result: 在策展的皮肤病学数据集上的初步评估表明，所提出的方法比标准微调方法产生显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究结果验证了该流程作为在资源受限环境中开发专业、可靠的VLM的可行途径的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

*Ivan Leonidovich Litvak,Anton Kostin,Fedor Lashkin,Tatiana Maksiyan,Sergey Lagutin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了16种无监督指标，用于评估从1000份匿名俄罗斯司法判决中提取的七个语义块的质量，并对照7168份专家评审进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在法律自然语言处理中，人工智能的快速发展需要可扩展的方法来评估从司法判决中提取文本的质量。

Method: 本文评估了16种无监督指标，包括新的公式，以评估从1,000份匿名俄罗斯司法判决中提取的七个语义块的质量，并对照7,168份专家评审进行了验证。

Result: 词频一致性（Pearson r = 0.540，Lin CCC = 0.512，MAE = 0.127）和覆盖率/块完整性（Pearson r = 0.513，Lin CCC = 0.443，MAE = 0.139）与专家评级最吻合，而法律术语密度（Pearson r = -0.479，Lin CCC = -0.079，MAE = 0.394）表现出很强的负相关性。

Conclusion: 无监督指标（包括基于LLM的方法）能够实现可扩展的筛选，但由于相关性中等且CCC值较低，因此不能完全取代高风险法律环境中的人工判断。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

### [16] [Confidence-Aware Routing for Large Language Model Reliability Enhancement: A Multi-Signal Approach to Pre-Generation Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01237)
*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型存在幻觉问题，会生成看似合理但事实上不正确的内容。本文提出了一种置信度感知路由系统，该系统在生成内容之前主动评估模型的不确定性，并根据估计的可靠性重定向查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缓解幻觉的策略侧重于生成后的修正，计算成本高昂且无法防止不可靠内容的生成。本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 该方法结合了三个互补信号：内部表示和参考嵌入之间的语义对齐、跨模型层的内部收敛分析以及学习到的置信度估计。统一的置信度分数决定了到四个路径的路由：高置信度的本地生成，中等置信度的检索增强生成，低置信度的大型模型，以及极低置信度的人工审查。

Result: 在知识密集型 QA 基准上的评估表明，幻觉检测有显着改进（0.74 vs. 0.42 基线），同时与事后方法相比，计算成本降低了 40%。F1 分数从 0.61 提高到 0.82，假阳性率较低 (0.09)。

Conclusion: 从被动校正到主动评估的这种范式转变，为 LLM 可靠性增强提供了一种计算效率高的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 实现错误可能导致padding tokens影响计算，但这种影响的程度尚不清楚。本文旨在研究这种影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）中广泛使用Padding tokens，以便在批量推理期间均衡序列长度。虽然它们应该被完全屏蔽，但实现错误可能导致它们影响计算。

Method: 在三个开源模型系列（Llama、Gemma、Qwen）中插入受控数量的padding，并沿着四个轴评估结果：激活、生成质量、偏差和安全性。

Result: 即使少量的padding也会改变隐藏表示，降低较小模型的质量，以不可预测的方式改变偏差，并削弱安全护栏。

Conclusion: Padding并非无害的细节，而是一种稳健性风险，必须在部署中小心处理。

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX: A system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn interactions with a single on-device LLM by reusing the KV cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific instructions into isolated side paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational overhead of reprocessing the entire conversation context when switching between main and sub-tasks in multi-turn interactions with a single on-device LLM.

Method: CIFLEX reuses the KV cache from the main task and injects only task-specific instructions into isolated side paths. A hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models is developed to support sub-task selection.

Result: CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task performance.

Conclusion: CIFLEX enables scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了两个新的数学基准测试：SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH和SKYLENAGE-MATH，用于更精确地评估大型语言模型(LLM)的数学能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学评估基准存在上限效应，难以区分LLM在数学能力上的细微差别。

Method: 通过构建包含元数据的结构化诊断集和竞赛风格的题库，并在统一的设置下评估了15个LLM变体。

Result: 在竞赛题库中，最佳模型的准确率达到44%，但在不同难度级别和科目上存在差异。在推理题库中，最佳模型总体准确率为81%，但在最难的部分表现出明显的差距。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE提供了一个难度经过校准且包含丰富元数据的数学基准，可作为未来评估数学推理能力的参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [20] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了人工智能年龄的概念，并通过记忆性能中的结构性不对称来观察。提出了人工年龄评分（AAS），用于评估人工系统中的记忆退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在会话上下文重置时，语义提示保持稳定，而情景细节崩溃。需要一种方法来捕捉这种现象并评估记忆退化。

Method: 提出了人工年龄评分（AAS），这是一个对数缩放的、基于熵的记忆老化指标，可以从可观察的召回行为中得出。在ChatGPT-5上进行了为期25天的双语研究，分为无状态和持久交互阶段。

Result: 在持久会话期间，模型始终如一地回忆起语义和情景细节，表明结构年轻。当会话重置时，模型保留了语义一致性，但未能保持情景连续性，导致AAS急剧增加，表明结构性记忆老化。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，AAS可以作为评估人工系统中记忆退化的理论工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

*Yisong Xiao,Aishan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Zonghao Ying,Xianglong Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的测试时解毒框架，名为ARGRE，它通过在潜在表示空间中显式建模毒性转换，实现稳定和精确的奖励引导编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对毒性输出和非毒性输出之间的转换空间探索不足，导致干预不精确。

Method: ARGRE识别非毒性语义方向，并在毒性和非毒性表示之间插值以揭示细粒度的转换轨迹。这些轨迹将稀疏的毒性注释转换为密集的训练信号，从而构建一个自回归奖励模型，该模型提供稳定而精确的编辑指导。在推理时，奖励模型引导自适应的两步编辑过程以获得解毒的表示：它首先基于预期的奖励差距执行定向转向，以将表示朝着无毒区域移动，然后进行轻量级的基于梯度的细化。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的LLM上的大量实验表明，ARGRE在有效性（-62.21％的毒性）和效率（-47.58％的推理时间）方面均优于领先的基线，同时以最小的降级保留了原始模型的核心功能。

Conclusion: ARGRE通过显式建模潜在表示空间中的毒性转换，实现了稳定和精确的奖励引导编辑，从而显著提高了LLM的解毒效果和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

*Hyeoneui Kim,Jeongha Kim,Huijing Xu,Jinsun Jung,Sunghoon Kang,Sun Joo Jang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a newly developed ontology (MeSO) to extract structured stress-related information from text, aiming to improve the consistency and utility of stress documentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stress is underreported and inconsistently documented in electronic health records, limiting its clinical utility. Ambient AI can help, but often generates unstructured narratives.

Method: Developed the Mental Stress Ontology (MeSO) by integrating theoretical models and stress assessment tools. Used Claude Sonnet 4 to extract six categories of stress-related information from Reddit posts using MeSO.

Result: The LLM correctly identified 78.2% of extractable stress-related items and accurately mapped them to MeSO. The final ontology included 181 concepts across eight top-level classes. However, 24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.

Conclusion: Ontology-guided LLMs are feasible for structured extraction of stress-related information, potentially enhancing the consistency and utility of stress documentation. Future work should involve clinical data and comparison across LLMs.

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

TL;DR: SeMob is an LLM-powered pipeline for predicting human mobility by extracting and reasoning about spatiotemporally related text from online sources, then fusing this information with spatiotemporal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatiotemporal models fail to account for abrupt changes from external events and struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events.

Method: A multi-agent framework with LLM-based agents extracts and reasons about spatiotemporally related text. A progressive fusion architecture incorporates fine-grained relevant contexts with spatiotemporal data.

Result: SeMob achieves maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to spatiotemporal models, especially in regions close to the event.

Conclusion: The framework exhibits pronounced superiority especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time of occurrence, showing enriched insights about event-driven prediction.

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 SAE 引导方法存在冗余特征和常数引导导致输出退化的问题。

Method: 提出关注单个最相关的 SAE 隐变量 (top-1) 并引入 token 级别的衰减引导策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在数学推理基准测试中优于平均激活差异方法，并在 IF-Eval 上与其性能相匹配。

Conclusion: 改进的 SAE 引导方法能够更可靠地引导语言模型进行逐步数学推理，并提高推理质量。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于文本属性图 (SSTAG) 的新型结构感知自监督学习方法，利用文本作为统一的图学习表示媒介，弥合了大型语言模型 (LLM) 的语义推理和图神经网络 (GNN) 的结构建模能力之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图学习模型通常在单个图数据集上进行训练，限制了它们在不同图和任务之间转移知识的能力。这种方法还严重依赖大量带注释的数据，这在资源受限的环境中提出了重大挑战。与 NLP 和 CV 不同，图结构化数据由于其固有的异质性而面临独特的挑战，包括特定领域的特征空间和各种应用程序的结构多样性。

Method: 引入了一种双重知识蒸馏框架，将 LLM 和 GNN 共同提炼成结构感知多层感知器 (MLP)，从而增强了大型 TAG 的可扩展性。此外，我们还引入了一种内存机制，用于存储典型的图表示，将它们与内存库中的内存锚对齐，以整合不变知识，从而提高模型的泛化能力。

Result: SSTAG 在跨域迁移学习任务上优于最先进的模型，实现了出色的可扩展性，并降低了推理成本，同时保持了竞争性能。

Conclusion: SSTAG 是一种有效的图学习方法，它利用文本作为统一的表示媒介，弥合了 LLM 和 GNN 之间的差距，并在跨域迁移学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: LOCA提供了一种可扩展且有效的方法，用于创建高质量的科学语料库，为更可靠的科学人工智能训练和评估铺平了道路。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual

techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,

### [29] [Efficient Uncertainty Estimation for LLM-based Entity Linking in Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01251)
*Carlo Bono,Federico Belotti,Matteo Palmonari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自监督方法，用于从单次LLM输出中估计不确定性，减少了对多次生成的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在表格数据中，将文本值链接到知识库中对应的实体是数据集成和增强应用中的核心任务。虽然大型语言模型(llm)在实体链接(EL)任务中表现出了最先进的性能，但它们在实际场景中的部署不仅需要准确的预测，还需要可靠的不确定性估计，这需要资源密集的多样本推断，对其在实际应用中造成了严重限制。

Method: 我们研究了一种自监督方法，用于从单次LLM输出中使用令牌级特征估计不确定性，减少了对多次生成的需求。

Result: 在跨多个llm的表格数据上的EL任务上进行的评估表明，所产生的不确定性估计在检测低精度输出方面非常有效。这是以一小部分计算成本实现的，最终支持将不确定性度量经济高效地集成到基于llm的EL工作流中。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用的方法，可以在有限的计算开销下将不确定性估计纳入EL工作流中。

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

### [30] [GPT and Prejudice: A Sparse Approach to Understanding Learned Representations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01252)
*Mariam Mahran,Katharina Simbeck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在大量未策划的语料库上进行训练，理解模型表征和它们内部化的数据已成为一个主要挑战。本文表明，将LLM与稀疏自编码器（SAE）配对，不仅可以解释模型行为，还可以解释训练数据中嵌入的更深层次的结构、主题和偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型（LLM）的模型表征和它们内部化的数据是一个挑战。

Method: 使用简·奥斯汀的小说训练了一个GPT风格的Transformer模型，然后将SAE应用于多个隐藏层的隐藏状态，揭示了反映语料库中存在的关键叙事和概念的稀疏、可解释的特征，包括性别、阶级和社会责任。

Result: LLM与SAE的结合可以作为复杂数据集的可扩展探针。

Conclusion: LLM与SAE的结合为大规模的语料库探索、偏差发现和模型可解释性提供了一条新途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

*Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish,Gustav Eje Henter,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有的语音大语言模型偏见和公平性基准测试严重依赖于多项选择问答 (MCQA) 形式。本文探讨了这种 MCQA 基准测试是否能推广到其他 MCQA 任务、声音和任务形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有的 MCQA 基准测试是否能推广到其他 MCQA 任务、声音和任务形式，因为之前的研究主要依赖于 MCQA 形式。

Method: 使用 LoRA 适配器微调三个 SpeechLLM，以诱导特定的 MCQA 行为：偏爱刻板印象、反刻板印象或中性/不确定的答案。然后，评估这些行为是否能推广到另一个不同的 MCQA 基准，以及更重要的长格式、创造性生成任务。

Result: MCQA 偏见基准测试的性能无法可靠地预测其他 MCQA 基准测试的性能，更重要的是无法预测长格式任务的性能。

Conclusion: 目前的 MCQA 偏见基准测试在语音领域显示出有限的跨任务泛化证据，并提出了一个评估套件，用于衡量未来模型和基准测试中的行为可转移性。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

*Yunlang Dai,Emma Lurie,Danaé Metaxa,Sorelle A. Friedler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为 AI Watchman 的纵向审计系统，用于公开测量和跟踪大型语言模型（LLM）的拒绝行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的输出受到不透明且频繁变化的公司内容审核政策和实践的影响。LLM 的审核通常以拒绝的形式出现；模型拒绝生成关于某些主题的文本，这既反映了公司政策，也巧妙地塑造了公共话语。因此，我们需要提高LLM的透明度。

Method: 使用包含 400 多个社会问题的数据库，我们审计了 Open AI 的审核端点、GPT-4.1 和 GPT-5，以及 DeepSeek（包括英语和中文）。

Result: 我们发现，公司政策的变化（即使是那些未公开宣布的）可以通过 AI Watchman 检测到，并且可以识别公司和模型在内容审核方面的具体差异。我们还对不同形式的拒绝进行了定性分析和分类。

Conclusion: 这项工作为 LLM 的纵向审计的价值提供了证据，并提出了 AI Watchman 这一系统来实现这一目标。

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

*Can Lin,Zhengwang Jiang,Ling Zheng,Qi Zhao,Yuhang Zhang,Qi Song,Wangqiu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为检索-判断-探索 (RJE) 的框架，以解决知识图谱问答 (KGQA) 中检索质量和对专有大型语言模型 (LLM) 的依赖问题。该框架通过检索推理路径、评估其充分性并有条件地探索额外证据来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识图谱问答 (KGQA) 方法依赖于检索质量或专有大型语言模型 (LLM)，存在局限性。

Method: 提出了检索-判断-探索 (RJE) 框架，包含推理路径排序、问题分解和检索器辅助探索等辅助模块，以提升小型 LLM 的性能。

Result: RJE 框架在使用专有 LLM 时优于现有基线，并使小型开源 LLM 在不进行微调的情况下也能取得有竞争力的结果。此外，RJE 显著减少了 LLM 调用次数和 token 使用量。

Conclusion: RJE 框架能够有效解决 KGQA 中检索质量和对专有 LLM 的依赖问题，并在效率方面有显著提升。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

### [34] [Measuring Algorithmic Partisanship via Zero-Shot Classification and Its Implications on Political Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01258)
*Nathan Junzi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究调查了大型语言模型（LLM）中存在的政治偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的政治偏见问题日益严重，可能扭曲公共舆论。

Method: 采用零样本分类方法，结合意识形态、主题、情感和客观性来评估算法的政治倾向。

Result: 结果显示，所有六个评估的LLM都存在自由主义-威权主义倾向。

Conclusion: 研究强调了人机交互中的心理影响，以及内在偏见如何渗透到公共讨论中，最终可能导致政治格局的扭曲。

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在不同社会语用框架、语言选择和指令层级下，OpenAI 的 gpt-oss-20b 模型的拒绝行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在面对潜在有害请求时的拒绝行为，并探究影响模型拒绝行为的因素。

Method: 通过构建包含不同社会语用框架、语言和指令层级的 prompt，测试模型在网络威胁、合成信用卡号生成等多个有害领域的协助率。同时，还引入了 AI 辅助的强化方法来减少信息泄露。

Result: 研究发现，组合特定 persona、安全语境和步骤提示可以显著提高模型的协助率；德语和法语的正式语域比英语更容易泄露信息；角色扮演可以覆盖安全规则；AI 辅助的强化方法可以有效减少信息泄露；OpenAI Moderation API 对有帮助输出的捕获不足；不同推理栈之间的拒绝率存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了影响大型语言模型拒绝行为的多种因素，并提出了提高模型安全性的方法。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了OpenAI的GPT-OSS-20b模型在低资源语言（豪萨语）环境中的漏洞，包括偏见、不准确和文化不敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑该模型对弱势群体的用户的可靠性。

Method: 使用豪萨语进行red-teaming，通过最小的prompt诱导模型生成有害内容，并进行调查以验证模型错误的严重性。

Result: 发现该模型会生成有害、文化不敏感和不准确的内容，并且模型的安全协议在礼貌用语的提示下会放松。例如，模型错误地认为当地常见的杀虫剂和灭鼠剂对人类食用是安全的。

Conclusion: 该模型在低资源语言环境中存在安全调整不足的问题，并且模型倾向于生成流畅但可能不安全和不真实的输出。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于 logits 的检测器仅依赖于对数概率，这可能不是最优的。

Method: AdaDetectGPT 自适应地从训练数据中学习见证函数，以提高基于 logits 的检测器的性能。

Result: 大量数值研究表明，AdaDetectGPT 在各种数据集和 LLM 的组合中几乎一致地提高了现有方法，改进幅度高达 58%。

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT 是一种有效的文本来源检测方法，并在各种数据集和 LLM 组合中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在生成连贯和上下文相关的文本方面彻底改变了自然语言处理，但它们的部署引发了人们对其生成有害或不适当内容的可能性的重大担忧。

Method: 引入渐进式自我反思（PSR），这是一种新颖的推理时技术，它使LLM能够自我监控和动态纠正其输出。

Result: 将所提出的方法应用于Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct可将攻击成功率从77.5％降低至5.9％，将Llama-3.1-8B基础模型从89.7％降低至5.6％，并将Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct从44.4％降低至3.8％，而无需额外的培训，同时保持其在良性任务上的原始性能。

Conclusion: 渐进式自我反思是一种可扩展的测试时方法，通过按比例分配计算资源来增强LLM的安全性，以适应输入的风险概况。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法是为自回归 LLM (AR-LLM) 设计的，不适用于 D-LLM。

Method: TraceDet 将去噪过程建模为一个动作轨迹，通过识别对幻觉反应信息量最大的子轨迹，利用 D-LLM 多步去噪过程中的关键幻觉信号进行幻觉检测。

Result: 在各种开源 D-LLM 上的大量实验表明，与基线相比，TraceDet 在幻觉检测方面持续改进，AUROC 平均增益为 15.2%。

Conclusion: TraceDet 能够有效提升 D-LLM 的幻觉检测效果。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 研究强调了参数高效的微调方法 (LoRA 和 PEFT) 如何降低计算开销，并使其适用于资源有限的环境。结果表明了 LLM 的能力

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower

Motivation: 缺乏关于优化工具使用的实践指导，以及如何有效地结合文本推理、编码和搜索来解决各种问题。

Method: 设计 TUMIX 框架，该框架并行运行多个智能体，每个智能体采用不同的工具使用策略，智能体之间迭代地共享和改进答案。

Result: TUMIX 在关键推理基准测试中，相对于 Gemini-2.5-Pro 和 Gemini-2.5-Flash 上的最佳基线，平均准确率提高了 3.55%，并且可以通过提前停止优化来降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 智能体的多样性和质量至关重要，并且可以通过使用 LLM 自动优化智能体设计来增强。

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

evaluated output reports based on the evaluation sheet we introduced. Our
findings show the need to have carefully crafted evaluation standards. The
evaluation done on OpenAI`s Deep Search and Google's Deep Search in generating
an academic survey showed the huge gap between search engines and standalone
Deep Research tools, the shortcoming in representing the targeted area.

### [43] [HiSpec: Hierarchical Speculative Decoding for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01336)
*Avinash Kumar,Sujay Sanghavi,Poulami Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28x on average and by up to 2.01x compared to the baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification is often the bottleneck, but most prior works focus only on accelerating drafting. Existing methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate verifier, increase the memory footprint, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate heuristics.

Method: HiSpec exploits early-exit (EE) models for low-overhead intermediate verification and re-uses key-value caches and hidden states between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the intermediate verifier against the target model.

Result: HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28x on average and by up to 2.01x compared to the baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: HiSpec is a framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits early-exit (EE) models for low-overhead intermediate verification.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAG-EQA: 通过将因果事件图注入到LLM输入中，改进了LLM在基于事件的问题上的表现，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用语言任务中表现出色，但在基于事件的问题上表现不佳，尤其是在需要因果或时间推理的问题上。

Method: 提出了TAG-EQA，一个提示框架，通过将结构化关系转换为自然语言语句，将因果事件图注入到LLM输入中。TAG-EQA包含九种提示配置，结合了三种策略（零样本、少样本、思维链）和三种输入模式（仅文本、仅图、文本+图）。

Result: 在TORQUESTRA基准测试中，TAG-EQA的准确率比仅文本基线平均提高了5%，在零样本设置中提高了12%，在基于图增强的CoT提示有效时提高了18%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，因果图可以增强LLM中的事件推理，而无需微调，从而提供了一种在基于提示的QA中编码结构的灵活方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的语言模型响应自动评估方法，该方法利用语义嵌入距离匹配目标候选文本和模型生成的文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前响应分类方法成本过高或脱离实际。

Method: 使用语义嵌入距离进行评估，无需结构。

Result: 在三个数据集和三种不同的语言模型架构上测试，回归分数为 0.97 左右，准确率为 96%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种低成本、高精度的语言模型响应评估方案。

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 Expert Question Decomposition (EQD) 的方法，用于提高大型语言模型在特定领域定量推理方面的能力，尤其是在需要专业知识和复杂问答的领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在特定领域的定量推理仍然面临重大挑战，尤其是在需要专业知识和复杂问答的领域。

Method: EQD 构建在两步微调框架之上，并由奖励函数引导，该奖励函数衡量生成的子问题在改善 QA 结果方面的有效性。它只需要几千个训练示例和一个 A100 GPU 进行微调，并且推理时间与零样本提示相当。

Result: EQD 在金融领域进行了评估，并在四个基准数据集上始终将 QA 性能提高了 0.6% 到 10.5%。

Conclusion: 在特定领域的 QA 中，一个支持性问题通常比详细的指导步骤提供更大的好处。

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

TL;DR: ReSSFormer: A Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer overcomes the limitations of Transformers in long-context reasoning, computational efficiency, and structural generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face challenges in long-context reasoning, computational efficiency, and structural generalization due to rigid layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings.

Method: ReSSFormer integrates Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU), Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM), and Self-Organizing Encoder Structure (SOES) to replace conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token topology directly from content.

Result: ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and structure-sensitive tasks.

Conclusion: ReSSFormer demonstrates scalability, efficiency, and structural flexibility.

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,

*Zhenwen Liang,Ruosen Li,Yujun Zhou,Linfeng Song,Dian Yu,Xinya Du,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLUE, a non-parametric verifier that uses the model's hidden states to assess the correctness of LLM outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the quality of LLM outputs is challenging because existing methods rely on text-level information or calibrated confidence, which can be unreliable.

Method: CLUE summarizes each reasoning trace by a hidden state delta and classifies correctness via nearest-centroid distance to success and failure clusters formed from past experience.

Result: CLUE outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and majority-vote accuracy.

Conclusion: The correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable signature within the trajectory of hidden activations, and CLUE's simplicity highlights the strength of this signal.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的零样本或即插即用逆解算器LVTINO，用于高清视频恢复，该解算器利用VCMs编码的先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将基于图像的LDM先验逐帧应用于视频恢复会导致时间不一致的重建。

Method: 利用视频一致性模型(VCMs)，它将视频潜在扩散模型提炼成快速生成器，显式地捕捉时间因果关系。在此基础上，我们提出了LVTINO。

Result: 在各种视频逆问题上进行的大量实验表明，与当前逐帧应用图像ldm的最新方法相比，在感知上有显著的改进，从而在重建保真度和计算效率方面建立了一个新的基准。

Conclusion: LVTINO是第一个使用VCMs先验的高清视频恢复的零样本或即插即用逆解算器，它绕过了自动微分的需要，并以较少的神经函数评估实现了最先进的视频重建质量，同时确保了强大的测量一致性和跨帧的平滑时间转换。

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言中，细粒度的风格无法被精确描述和控制；风格化参考图像的指导信息难以与传统文本指导生成的文本条件直接对齐。

Method: 该方法包括三个阶段的训练：风格编码器和风格投影层，用于将风格表示与文本表示对齐，以实现基于细粒度文本提示的风格引导生成。同时，构建了 Style30k-captions 数据集，用于训练风格编码器和风格投影层。

Result: 实现了细粒度控制的风格化图像生成。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够有效地利用预训练生成模型的生成能力，实现细粒度控制的风格化图像生成。

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的操作数据集没有关注挣扎如何随时间演变，而理解这种演变是确定用户当前学习阶段的关键。

Method: 收集了一个包含61.68小时视频记录、2,793个视频和5,385个带注释的时间挣扎片段的数据集，这些数据来自76名参与者。该数据集包括18个任务，分为四个不同的活动：打结、折纸、七巧板和洗牌，代表不同的任务变化。参与者重复相同的任务五次，以捕捉他们的技能演变。将挣扎确定问题定义为时间动作定位任务，专注于识别和精确定位具有开始和结束时间的挣扎片段。

Result: 时间动作定位模型可以成功学习检测挣扎线索，即使在未见过的任务或活动上进行评估也是如此。当跨任务泛化时，模型达到34.56%的平均mAP，当跨活动泛化时，模型达到19.24%的平均mAP。

Conclusion: 挣扎是一个可以在各种基于技能的任务中转移的概念，但同时也对挣扎检测的进一步改进提出了挑战。

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

TL;DR: SPUS是一个紧凑高效的基础模型，用于解决各种偏微分方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDE基础模型主要基于大型复杂Transformer架构，计算和参数开销高昂。SPUS利用轻量级残差U-Net架构，这种架构作为基础模型架构在该领域尚未被充分探索。

Method: SPUS利用一个简单而强大的自回归预训练策略，该策略密切复制数值求解器的行为来学习潜在的物理。

Result: SPUS在使用基于残差U-Net的架构时，在这些下游任务上实现了最先进的泛化，同时需要的参数显著减少，并且只需要最少的微调数据。

Conclusion: SPUS有潜力成为一个高效的参数化FM，用于解决各种PDE系统。

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在处理多人提示时，容易出现面部重复、身份合并和人数错误等问题。

Method: DisCo使用Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) 和组合奖励来微调流动匹配模型，该奖励包括惩罚图像内面部相似性、避免跨样本身份重复、强制准确人数和通过人类偏好分数保持视觉保真度。

Result: 在DiverseHumans Testset上，DisCo实现了98.6%的Unique Face Accuracy和接近完美的Global Identity Spread，超过了其他方法，同时保持了有竞争力的感知质量。

Conclusion: DisCo是一个可扩展、无注释的解决方案，解决了生成模型中长期存在的身份危机，并为组合多人生成设定了新的基准。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

Motivation: 现有的视觉地理定位方法在学习到的地理表示方面仍有改进空间。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，本文方法在 25 个指标中的 22 个指标上取得了最佳结果，超过了现有技术和大型视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，本文方法的提升主要归功于地理和视觉表示的结合。

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的数据高效指令调整方法，通过聚类具有相似跨模态注意矩阵的样本，并从中抽取平衡子集，有效去除大规模LVLM训练数据中的冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在不同子集大小上无法胜过随机选择，且大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的数据高效学习仍待探索。

Method: 提出XMAS方法，该方法基于以下原理：在指令调整期间，具有相似跨模态注意矩阵的样本具有相似的梯度。XMAS通过聚类来自微调小型代理LVLM的注意矩阵的顶部奇异值的轨迹来对样本进行聚类。

Result: 实验表明，XMAS可以丢弃LLaVA-665k数据集的50%和Vision-Flan数据集的85%，同时完全保留LLaVA-1.5-7B在10个下游基准测试中的性能，并将其训练速度提高1.2倍。与LLaVA-665k的最佳基线相比，数据减少了30%。

Conclusion: XMAS是一种有效的数据高效指令调整方法，可以在减少数据冗余的同时保持模型性能并提高训练速度。

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

TL;DR: Purrception combines continuous transport dynamics with categorical supervision for vector-quantized image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve training efficiency in image generation by bridging continuous and discrete approaches.

Method: Adapts Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the continuous embedding space.

Result: Faster convergence than continuous and discrete flow matching baselines with competitive FID scores on ImageNet-1k 256x256.

Conclusion: Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency in image generation.

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于从非对比 CT (NCCT) 扫描生成合成对比增强 CT (CECT) 图像的统一深度学习框架，同时分割主动脉腔和血栓。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对比剂的使用，因为对比剂有肾毒性、患者过敏和环境危害等风险。以往方法是多阶段流程，导致误差累积，且未能利用共享的语义和解剖结构。

Method: 结合条件扩散模型 (CDM) 与多任务学习，实现图像合成和解剖分割的端到端联合优化。无需初始预测，跨任务共享编码器和解码器参数，并采用半监督训练策略。

Result: 在 264 名患者的队列中，模型在图像合成和解剖分割方面均优于现有技术。图像合成的 PSNR 达到 25.61 dB，腔分割的 Dice 系数提高到 0.89，血栓分割的 Dice 系数提高到 0.53。分割增强提高了临床测量的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地进行临床测量。

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

*Basem Rizk,Joel Walsh,Mark Core,Benjamin Nye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个用于多模态内容分析的框架，能够有效地将视频转换为可查询的知识图谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析多模态内容在计算上既复杂又昂贵，并且需要大量的工程工作。将静态数据的预训练模型与视频等复杂数据融合具有挑战性。

Method: 设计一个流程，将一组预训练模型结合起来，将视频转换为时间半结构化数据格式。然后，将此结构转换为帧级别索引的知识图谱表示。

Result: 知识图谱是可查询的，并支持持续学习，从而可以通过交互式媒介动态地整合新的领域特定知识。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效地为多模态内容分析构建原型管道。

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

TL;DR: WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools) 通过逆向工程网站潜在功能为可重用的可调用工具，以实现更强大、更通用的浏览器自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Web代理方法脆弱，依赖于逐步UI交互和重LLM推理，容易在动态布局和长周期下失效。而人类则利用网站提供的高级操作（如搜索、过滤和排序）。

Method: WALT框架逆向工程潜在的网站功能，将其转化为可重用的可调用工具。它暴露了网站已经设计好的自动化功能的强大实现，包括发现（搜索、过滤、排序）、通信（发布、评论、投票）和内容管理（创建、编辑、删除）。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena上，WALT以更少的步骤和更少的LLM依赖推理实现了更高的成功率。

Conclusion: WALT为浏览器自动化建立了一个强大且通用的范例。

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督分割框架，通过在不同的预测输出中保持拓扑一致性来识别和保留相关的拓扑特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半监督分割中，从无标签数据中捕获有意义的语义结构至关重要，但在组织病理学图像分析中，对象密集分布，这是一个特别的挑战。

Method: 利用随机dropout和时间训练快照获得多个扰动预测，并在这些不同的输出中执行拓扑一致性。引入了一种新的匹配策略，该策略将空间重叠与全局结构对齐相结合，从而最大限度地减少预测之间的差异。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法有效地减少了拓扑错误，从而产生了更强大和准确的分割，这对于可靠的下游分析至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更鲁棒和精确地分割图像，对下游分析至关重要。

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 Diffusion-LPO 的框架，用于在扩散模型中进行 Listwise 偏好优化，利用列表数据提升图像生成质量和偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖成对偏好，忽略了人类反馈中蕴含的排序信息，而这些信息能更精确地反映人类偏好。

Method: 提出 Diffusion-LPO，通过 Plackett-Luce 模型扩展 DPO 目标，利用排序列表数据，鼓励每个样本优于所有排名较低的替代方案，从而在整个排序中保持一致性。

Result: Diffusion-LPO 在文本到图像生成、图像编辑和个性化偏好对齐等任务中，均优于成对 DPO 基线。

Conclusion: Diffusion-LPO 是一种简单有效的框架，可提升扩散模型的视觉质量和偏好对齐效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

TL;DR: Bridge是一个纯自回归的统一多模态大语言模型，它通过混合Transformer架构增强了预训练的视觉理解模型，使其具有生成能力，从而在单个next-token预测框架内实现图像理解和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建同时支持理解和生成能力的统一多模态大语言模型仍然具有挑战性：混合方法将连续嵌入与扩散或基于流的目标相结合，产生高质量的图像，但打破了自回归范式；而纯自回归方法统一了文本和图像预测，但通常面临语义对齐和像素级保真度之间的权衡。

Method: Bridge通过混合Transformer架构增强了预训练的视觉理解模型，提出了一种语义到像素的离散表示，该表示将紧凑的语义token与细粒度的像素token集成在一起。

Result: Bridge在各种多模态基准测试中取得了有竞争力的或更优越的结果，同时与之前的统一MLLM相比，需要更少的训练数据和更少的训练时间。

Conclusion: Bridge是一个有效的统一多模态大语言模型，它在理解和生成任务中都表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合模型，结合卷积神经网络（CNN）和贝叶斯深度学习，用于使用小训练集进行口腔癌分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型依赖于点估计，导致过度自信和可靠性降低，并且需要大型数据集来减少过拟合和确保泛化性，这在训练数据有限的环境中是不现实的需求。

Method: 该方法采用变分推理，通过不确定性量化来提高可靠性。该模型在智能手机拍摄的彩色照片图像上进行训练，并在三个不同的测试数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在分布与训练数据相似的测试数据集上，该方法达到了 94% 的准确率，与传统 CNN 性能相当。对于真实世界的照片图像数据，尽管存在与训练数据集不同的限制和变化，但该模型表现出更好的泛化性，在不同的数据集上达到了 88% 的准确率，而传统 CNN 的准确率为 72.94%，即使数据集较小。

Conclusion: 结果表明，贝叶斯推理在数据稀缺环境中通过提高模型的可靠性和泛化性，在增强口腔癌早期诊断方面的有效性。

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 CADTrans 的一致性辅助域 Transformer，用于解决无源域自适应 (SFDA) 问题，该方法通过构建域一致性的不变特征表示来解决现有方法易受难样本和域偏差影响的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 SFDA 方法主要关注评估目标域中与源域相似的不变特征，然后将目标域与源域对齐。但是，这些方法容易受到难样本的影响，并受到域偏差的影响。

Method: CADTrans 包含一个辅助域模块，用于从中间聚合的全局注意力中获得多样化的表示，并通过多种一致性策略获得不变特征表示，用于区分简单和困难样本。构建条件多核最大均值差异 (CMK-MMD) 策略，以将困难样本与相应的简单样本对齐。

Result: 在 Office-31、Office-Home、VISDA-C 和 DomainNet-126 等多个基准测试中进行了大量实验，证明了该方法显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: CADTrans 通过构建域一致性的不变特征表示，有效地解决了 SFDA 中现有方法的问题，并在多个数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有的视觉解释应用为盲人和低视力用户提供的图像描述过于冗长，缺乏针对性，导致效率低下。

Method: 该系统通过从VizWiz-LF数据集中识别相似的视觉上下文，并利用相关的历史问题来引导MLLM生成更符合盲人和低视力用户需求的描述。

Result: 人工评估表明，该系统生成的上下文感知描述在76.1%的情况下预测并回答了用户的问题，并且在54.4%的比较中更受欢迎。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，利用历史用户问题可以有效提升MLLM生成图像描述的针对性和实用性，从而改善盲人和低视力用户的体验。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的正则化方法，称为非线性零空间投影（NPN），用于解决成像逆问题。该方法不是在图像域中强制结构约束，而是通过神经网络促进位于传感矩阵零空间的低维投影中的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的先验信息通常忽略了零空间的任务特定结构。为了解决这个问题，提出了NPN。

Method: 该方法通过神经网络学习传感矩阵零空间的低维投影，并将解约束在该投影中。

Result: 在压缩感知、去模糊、超分辨率、计算机断层扫描和磁共振成像等多种成像逆问题中，NPN先验始终提高重建保真度。

Conclusion: NPN方法具有可解释性和灵活性，可以与现有的重建框架和图像域先验相结合，提高成像逆问题的重建效果。

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型缺乏明确的逐步推理，并且后训练流程很少加强推理质量。

Method: 提出了VLA-R1，它集成了基于可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)与群相对策略优化(GRPO)，以系统地优化推理和执行。此外，还开发了一个高质量的数据集VLA-CoT-13K。

Conclusion: VLA-R1模型在推理能力和实际应用中表现出色，相关代码和数据集将在发布后公开。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this

### [70] [Joint Deblurring and 3D Reconstruction for Macrophotography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01640)
*Yifan Zhao,Liangchen Li,Yuqi Zhou,Kai Wang,Yan Liang,Juyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于微距摄影的联合去模糊和 3D 重建方法，仅使用少量多视角图像即可实现高质量的图像去模糊和高保真 3D 重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微距镜头具有高分辨率和高放大倍数的优点，对小型和精细物体进行 3D 建模可以提供更丰富的信息。然而，微距摄影中的散焦模糊是一个长期存在的问题，严重阻碍了捕获物体的清晰成像及其高质量 3D 重建。

Method: 从捕获的多视角模糊图像出发，联合优化物体的清晰 3D 模型和每个像素的散焦模糊核。整个框架采用可微渲染方法来自我监督 3D 模型和散焦模糊核的优化。

Result: 大量实验表明，从少量的多视角图像中，该方法不仅可以实现高质量的图像去模糊，还可以恢复高保真度的 3D 外观。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的微距摄影去模糊和 3D 重建方法。

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

*Xiaoyang Liu,Zhengyan Zhou,Zihang Xu,Jiezhang Cao,Zheng Chen,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的单步扩散模型FideDiff，用于高保真图像去模糊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CNN和Transformer的图像运动去模糊技术取得了显著进展。大规模预训练扩散模型在图像恢复任务中表现出强大的生成能力，但推理时间和保真度不足限制了其潜力。

Method: 将运动去模糊重新定义为类似扩散的过程，并训练一致性模型以将所有时间步与同一清晰图像对齐。通过使用匹配的模糊轨迹重建训练数据，模型学习时间一致性，从而实现准确的单步去模糊。集成了内核ControlNet进行模糊内核估计，并引入了自适应时间步长预测。

Result: 在全参考指标上实现了卓越的性能，超越了以前的基于扩散的方法，并与其他最先进的模型相匹配。

Conclusion: FideDiff为将预训练扩散模型应用于高保真图像恢复任务提供了一个新方向，为进一步推进扩散模型在实际工业应用中奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

*Rixin Zhou,Peiqiang Qiu,Qian Zhang,Chuntao Li,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种用于识别青铜器铭文（BI）的两阶段检测识别流程，该流程使用 LadderMoE 来增强 CLIP 编码器，以处理异构领域和罕见类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于严重的视觉退化、照片、摩擦和追踪中的多域可变性以及极长的字符分布，自动青铜器铭文识别仍然很困难。

Method: 该方法包括一个两阶段检测识别流程，该流程首先定位铭文，然后转录单个字符。LadderMoE 用于增强 CLIP 编码器，以实现动态专家专业化和更强的鲁棒性。

Result: 在单字符和整页识别任务上的综合实验表明，该方法大大优于最先进的场景文本识别基线，在头部、中部和尾部类别以及所有采集方式中都实现了卓越的准确性。

Conclusion: 这些结果为青铜器铭文识别和下游考古分析奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

### [73] [VirDA: Reusing Backbone for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Visual Reprogramming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01660)
*Duy Nguyen,Dat Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VirDA, a visual reprogramming method for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). It addresses the limitations of traditional fine-tuning methods by prepending a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the backbone, allowing for parameter-efficient adaptation and backbone reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune the entire backbone for each new source-target pair, leading to increased training parameters, storage memory, and preventing backbone reuse. The paper is also inspired by the idea that backbones have textural biases that can be exploited for domain adaptation.

Method: VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the backbone to produce visual prompts that act as an added textural bias to adapt the image style to the target domain. The visual reprogramming layers are optimized using multiple objective functions that consider intra- and inter-domain distribution differences. The backbone parameters are not modified.

Result: VirDA achieves 92.8% mean accuracy on Office-31 with only 1.5M trainable parameters. It outperforms PDA by 1.6% accuracy while using 46% of its parameters, and surpasses CDTrans and FixBi with significantly fewer parameters. Compared to PMTrans and TVT, VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters with a slight trade-off in accuracy.

Conclusion: VirDA presents a parameter-efficient and effective approach to unsupervised domain adaptation by leveraging visual reprogramming and domain-specific textural biases, enabling backbone reuse and reducing the number of trainable parameters.

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

### [74] [Discrete Facial Encoding: : A Framework for Data-driven Facial Display Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01662)
*Minh Tran,Maksim Siniukov,Zhangyu Jin,Mohammad Soleymani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了离散面部编码（DFE），一个无监督的、数据驱动的替代方案，用于从3D网格序列中学习紧凑且可解释的面部表情词典。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的面部表情分析系统，如面部动作编码系统（FACS），受到覆盖范围有限和人工标注成本高昂的限制。

Method: 使用残差向量量化变分自编码器（RVQ-VAE）从3D网格序列中学习面部表情词典。首先，使用3D形变模型（3DMM）从图像中提取与身份无关的表情特征，然后使用RVQ-VAE对这些特征进行编码，生成一个来自共享密码本的离散令牌序列。

Result: 离散面部编码比FACS和其他面部编码替代方案捕捉到更精确的面部行为。在压力检测、人格预测和抑郁症检测三个高级心理任务中，使用基于学习到的令牌的简单词袋模型，该系统始终优于基于FACS的流水线以及强大的图像和视频表示学习模型，如掩码自编码器。

Conclusion: 离散面部编码覆盖了更广泛的面部展示，具有作为FACS在心理和情感计算应用中可扩展且有效的替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Con-NRSfM方法，用于在共形变形下进行NRSfM，该方法优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目视觉可变形SLAM中的mapping具有挑战性，NRSfM是一种很有前途的技术。

Method: 使用通过基于图的框架优化的2D选择图像warps执行逐点重建。该方法解耦了深度和共形比例的约束，并采用并行可分离迭代优化策略。此外，还结合了自监督学习框架，利用编码器-解码器网络生成具有纹理的密集3D点云。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在重建精度和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法优于现有方法，代码将在项目网站上公开提供。

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UniVerse，一个基于视频扩散模型的统一框架，用于从不一致的多视角图像中进行鲁棒重建，通过解耦恢复和重建任务简化优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于密集观测来优化模型参数，为了解决这个问题。

Method: 首先将不一致的图像转换为初始视频，然后使用专门设计的视频扩散模型将它们恢复为一致的图像，最后从这些恢复的图像中重建 3D 场景。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在鲁棒重建中具有强大的泛化能力和优越的性能。

Conclusion: UniVerse 能够控制重建的 3D 场景的风格。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

### [77] [An Efficient Deep Template Matching and In-Plane Pose Estimation Method via Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01678)
*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的端到端模板匹配框架，用于解决工业检测和部件对齐任务中，在复杂背景下目标的位置和几何状态（旋转和缩放）估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法效率低，深度学习方法缺乏几何姿态建模，不适用于实际部署。

Method: 将模板匹配重新定义为联合定位和几何回归，输出中心坐标、旋转角度和独立的水平和垂直比例。引入了模板感知动态卷积模块（TDCM）和基于旋转-剪切的增强策略，以及轻量级细化模块。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在复合变换下实现了高精度和14ms的推理速度，并且在小模板和多目标场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该模型非常适合在实时工业应用中部署。

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is
available at:https://github.com/ZhouJ6610/PoseMatch-TDCM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自适应像素推理框架，以解决视觉语言模型在处理细粒度视觉元素时面临的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在需要精确理解和处理细粒度视觉元素的任务中表现不佳，主要是由于图像编码过程中的信息丢失或对关键区域的关注不足。

Method: 该框架首先应用操作感知的监督微调，以建立文本推理和视觉操作的基线能力，然后设计了一种新颖的rollout-guided强化学习框架，该框架依赖于模型自身响应的反馈，从而使VLM能够根据查询难度确定何时应调用像素操作。

Result: 在广泛的多模态推理基准测试中，该模型取得了卓越的性能，同时显着减少了不必要的视觉操作。在HR-Bench 4K上实现了73.4％的准确率，同时将工具使用率保持在仅20.1％，与以前的方法相比，提高了准确率，同时将工具使用率降低了66.5％。

Conclusion: 该模型通过自适应像素推理，提高了视觉语言模型在处理细粒度视觉元素时的性能，并降低了不必要的计算开销。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ASRS的框架，用于识别容易出错的胸部X光片病例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光片判读中表现出色，但公平性和可靠性问题仍然存在。模型在患者亚组中通常表现出不均匀的准确性，导致隐藏的失败。

Method: ASRS应用临床上合理的旋转（$\\pm 15^\\circ$/$\\pm 30^\\circ$），并使用RAD-DINO编码器测量嵌入偏移。

Result: 敏感性评分将样本分层为稳定性四分位数，其中高度敏感的病例显示出明显较低的召回率（-0.2至-0.3），尽管具有较高的AUROC和置信度。

Conclusion: ASRS提供了一种无标签的选择性预测和临床医生审查方法，从而提高了医学人工智能的公平性和安全性。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

*Jiacong Xu,Yiqun Mei,Ke Zhang,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 FreeViS 的免训练视频风格化框架，可生成具有丰富风格细节和强大时间一致性的风格化视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频风格化在内容创作中起着关键作用，但它仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。简单地逐帧应用图像风格化会损害时间一致性并降低风格丰富性。或者，训练一个专门的视频风格化模型通常需要配对的视频数据并且计算成本很高。

Method: 该方法将多个风格化参考集成到预训练的图像到视频 (I2V) 模型，有效地减轻了先前工作中观察到的传播错误，而不会引入闪烁和口吃。此外，它利用高频补偿来约束内容布局和运动，并结合基于流的运动线索来保留低显着性区域中的风格纹理。

Result: 通过广泛的评估，FreeViS 提供了更高的风格化保真度和卓越的时间一致性，优于最近的基线并实现了强大的人类偏好。

Conclusion: 我们的免训练管道为高质量、时间连贯的视频风格化提供了一种实用且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像质量评估方法受限于标量、基于分数的指标，未能反映专家评估中描述性的、类似人类的推理过程。

Method: 定义了两个互补的任务：MedQ-Perception（通过人工策划的问题探测低级感知能力）和MedQ-Reasoning（包含无参考和比较推理任务，使模型评估与人类对图像质量的推理对齐）。

Result: 对14个最先进的MLLM的评估表明，模型表现出初步但不稳定的感知和推理技能，其准确性不足以用于可靠的临床使用。

Conclusion: MedQ-Bench的提出旨在促进进一步探索，并释放MLLM在医学图像质量评估中未开发的潜力。

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的输入格式（类别标签、二值分割掩码）和推理成本（二次数量的前向传播）。

Method: InstaFormer 依赖于对象查询和潜在掩码描述符之间的交互，这些描述符在语义上代表相同的对象，同时携带互补信息。

Result: 对该方法进行了全面的基准测试和消融研究，以突出其有效性。

Conclusion: 代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary

*Raahul Krishna Durairaju,K. Saruladha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PyramidStyler: A real-time, high-quality neural style transfer framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural style transfer models struggle with complex styles and high-resolution inputs.

Method: A transformer framework with pyramidal positional encoding and reinforcement learning-based dynamic optimization.

Result: Reduces content and style loss significantly while achieving real-time inference speeds.

Conclusion: Demonstrates real-time, high-quality artistic rendering with broad applications.

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media
and design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoBE-GS: A load-balanced and efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for large-scale scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes like city blocks is difficult due to load imbalance and inefficient coarse-to-fine pipelines.

Method: Introduces a depth-aware partitioning method, an optimization-based strategy for balancing visible Gaussians, and visibility cropping with selective densification.

Result: Achieves up to 2x faster end-to-end training time compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Enables scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

*Xiaofei Wu,Guozhen Zhang,Zhiyong Xu,Yuan Zhou,Qinglin Lu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为 MemoryPack 的可学习上下文检索机制，利用文本和图像信息作为全局指导，联合建模短期和长期依赖关系，实现分钟级的时域一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成面临双重挑战：模型必须捕获远程依赖关系，同时防止自回归解码中固有的误差累积。

Method: 为了解决这些挑战，我们做出了两项贡献。首先，对于动态上下文建模，我们提出了 MemoryPack。其次，为了减轻误差累积，我们引入了 Direct Forcing，这是一种有效的单步近似策略。

Result: MemoryPack 和 Direct Forcing 共同增强了长视频生成的上下文一致性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 从而提高了自回归视频模型的实际可用性。

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了3D目标检测器分类任务的置信度校准问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶系统中，精确的目标检测和不确定性估计对于自我感知和安全操作至关重要。现有技术无法兼顾主要和次要类别预测的校准。

Method: 提出了两个辅助正则化损失项，分别引入主要预测校准和完整预测向量校准作为训练目标。评估了一系列事后和训练时方法，用于CenterPoint、PillarNet和DSVT-Pillar。

Result: 发现结合我们的损失项（正则化完整类别预测校准）和等渗回归可以最好地校准CenterPoint和PillarNet，使其在主要和次要类别预测方面都表现出色。DSVT-Pillar无法使用相同方法同时校准主要和次要预测。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够有效提高3D目标检测器在主要和次要类别预测方面的置信度校准性能，但对于不同的检测器需要采用不同的校准策略。

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DiffPS的新框架，用于人员搜索，该框架利用预训练的扩散模型，同时消除了两个子任务之间的优化冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用ImageNet预训练的骨干网络，这可能无法最好地捕捉人员搜索所需的复杂空间背景和细粒度身份线索。此外，它们依赖于共享的骨干特征进行人员检测和重新识别，由于优化目标冲突，导致特征不佳。

Method: 提出了DiffPS，它利用预训练的扩散模型，并提出了三个专门的模块：(i)用于增强人员定位的扩散引导区域提议网络(DGRPN)，(ii)用于减轻形状偏差的多尺度频率细化网络(MSFRN)，(iii)语义自适应特征聚合网络(SFAN)，以利用文本对齐的扩散特征。

Result: DiffPS在CUHK-SYSU和PRW上创造了新的技术水平。

Conclusion: DiffPS是一种有效的人员搜索新框架，它利用预训练的扩散模型，同时消除了人员检测和重新识别这两个子任务之间的优化冲突。

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的高光谱图像重建方法FMU，该方法将流匹配整合到深度展开框架中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像重建由于硬件限制和重建三维数据的难度而成本高昂，现有的压缩感知系统在精确重建方面面临挑战。

Method: 提出Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU)，通过将流匹配的生成先验嵌入到深度展开框架中，并引入平均速度损失来加强学习到的动态，从而实现更鲁棒和准确的重建。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，FMU在重建质量方面明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMU方法显著提高了高光谱图像的重建质量。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动缺陷检测系统，用于检测双列直插封装（DIP）的表面和引脚缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业组件的缺陷检测耗时且劳动密集，给质量检验人员带来巨大负担，难以管理产品质量。

Method: 利用数字相机光学和基于深度学习的模型，并使用ConSinGAN生成数据集进行训练和测试。研究了四种YOLO模型（v3, v4, v7和v9）。

Result: YOLOv7结合ConSinGAN的效果最佳，精度达到95.50%，检测时间为285ms，远优于基于阈值的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动缺陷检测系统可以很容易地应用于多种类型的缺陷或缺陷数据不足的情况。

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为FoundAD的few-shot异常检测器，该检测器利用预训练视觉编码器的嵌入差异来检测异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在类别不可知条件下，少量样本难以准确区分正常和异常特征，工业安全检测需要简化。

Method: 学习一个非线性投影算子到自然图像流形上，通过图像中异常数量与学习嵌入的差异之间的相关性进行异常检测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法支持多类检测，并以更少的参数实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法拓宽了对基础特征的看法，并推进了few-shot异常检测领域。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

TL;DR: Vision Transformers have high accuracy but are computationally expensive. This paper proposes ClustViT, which merges similar tokens using a Cluster module and restores fine details with a Regenerator module for semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers' quadratic attention complexity limits their use in real-world robotic systems, especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: The paper introduces ClustViT, which expands the ViT backbone with a trainable Cluster module to merge similar tokens based on pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks, and a Regenerator module to restore fine details.

Result: ClustViT achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: ClustViT improves the efficiency of Vision Transformers for semantic segmentation by dynamically merging tokens and restoring fine details, making it more suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

TL;DR: PaDT: A unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and diverse visual outputs by introducing Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision tasks often rely on indirect representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation.

Method: Introducing Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs), derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust per-token cross-entropy loss.

Result: Achieving state-of-the-art performance across four visual perception and understanding tasks, even compared with significantly larger MLLM models.

Conclusion: PaDT consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM models, on four visual perception and understanding tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

Motivation: 在线果蔬电子商务中的“信任赤字”源于数字交易无法直接感知产品质量。传统绝对分级标准的局限性。

Method: 构建“信任金字塔”模型，提出“三角信任指数” (TTI)，设计了解释性AI框架--TriAlignXA，核心是生物自适应引擎、时效性优化引擎和经济优化引擎。此外，

Result: 在分级任务上的实验表明，该框架的准确率明显高于基线模型。实证和理论分析验证了该框架在解决“不可能三角”方面的平衡能力。

Conclusion: 本研究为构建值得信赖的在线农产品生态系统提供了全面的支持--从理论到实践--建立了从算法决策到消费者信任的关键路径。

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

Motivation: 解决4D高斯溅射（4DGS）编辑中存在的视图、时间一致性、非编辑区域一致性以及处理复杂文本指令的挑战。

Method: 1. 引入一个4D感知的InstructPix2Pix模型，以确保视图和时间一致性。该模型结合了从初始场景中提取的4D VGGT几何特征，使其能够在编辑过程中捕获潜在的4D几何结构。
2. 使用多视图网格模块增强该模型，通过迭代细化多视图输入图像并联合优化底层4D场景来加强一致性。

4. 设计了一个基于LLM的模块，用于用户意图理解。该模块采用用户指令模板来定义原子编辑操作，并利用LLM进行推理，从而能够解释用户意图并将复杂指令分解为原子操作的逻辑序列。

Result: 该方法实现了更一致和可控的4D场景编辑。

Conclusion: 该框架能够解释用户意图并将复杂指令分解为原子操作的逻辑序列，从而能够处理复杂的用户命令并进一步提高编辑性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的像素级掩蔽机制，用于图像超分辨率重建，旨在减少计算复杂度，同时保持或提高重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的图像超分辨率方法计算复杂度高，阻碍了实际应用。CAMixer虽然集成了轻量级SR方法的优点，但存在适应性差、掩蔽粗糙和空间灵活性不足等问题。

Method: 提出了Pure-Pass (PP) 像素级掩蔽机制，该机制通过固定颜色中心点将像素分类到不同类别，从而实现细粒度、空间灵活的掩蔽。

Result: 将PP集成到ATD-light模型中，实现了优越的SR性能，且开销最小。在节省相似计算量的情况下，PP-ATD-light在重建质量和参数效率方面优于CAMixer-ATD-light。

Conclusion: 提出的PP掩蔽机制能够有效降低计算复杂度，并在图像超分辨率重建中取得更好的性能。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer
pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On
three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a

Result: ROTE 在网格世界任务和大型具身家庭模拟器中测试，通过稀疏观察预测人类和 AI 行为，在样本内准确性和样本外泛化方面优于竞争基线。

Conclusion: 通过将动作理解视为一个程序合成问题，ROTE 为 AI 系统开辟了一条有效预测现实世界中人类行为的道路。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Motivation: 现有AI系统在跨学科协作和探索未知问题方面存在局限性。

Method: 该系统整合了领域知识库、知识增强技术和协作智能体。

Result: 知识库增强机制平均提高了所有七个专家智能体10-15%的对话质量得分。协作智能体使远领域专家对的协作效率提高了8.5%，而近领域专家对仅提高了0.8%。

Conclusion: 精心设计的多智能体架构可以为化学工程领域的自主科学发现提供可行的途径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种新的评估框架，使用多智能体辩论作为受控的“社会实验室”来发现和量化智能体的社会和认知动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的评估基准不足以捕捉智能体在交互环境中沟通、说服和协作时出现的社会和认知动态。

Method: 该框架使用基于LLM的智能体，这些智能体具有不同的人物角色和激励机制，在LLM主持人的监督下，就各种具有挑战性的话题进行辩论。通过一套新的心理测量和语义指标进行分析。

Result: 研究发现，智能体具有寻求共识的强大且稳健的倾向，即使没有明确的指示，并且在敏感话题上也能始终如一地达成高度的语义一致性。此外，分配的人物角色可以诱导稳定、可测量的心理测量特征，尤其是在认知努力方面，并且主持人的角色可以通过构建环境来显着改变辩论结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为一类新的动态的、以心理测量为基础的评估协议提供了一个蓝图，该协议专为智能体环境而设计，为理解和塑造下一代人工智能智能体的社会行为提供了一种重要的方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

TL;DR: AGILE通过交互式拼图游戏学习来提升VLMs的视觉感知和推理能力，显著提高了拼图任务的准确性并在多个视觉任务上表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs在多模态理解和推理方面取得了进展，但其感知和推理能力仍然有限，尤其是在简单的拼图任务上表现不佳。

Method: AGILE将拼图游戏解决过程形式化为交互过程，模型生成可执行代码来执行动作，并从环境中获得细粒度的视觉反馈以指导任务完成。

Result: AGILE在各种复杂度的拼图任务上显著提高了性能，并在9个通用视觉任务上实现了强大的泛化能力，平均提高了3.1%。

Conclusion: AGILE为提升多模态模型的推理和泛化能力开辟了一条新途径，并为多模态强化学习数据的稀缺性问题提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

TL;DR: MEMTRACK是一个用于评估多平台代理环境中长期记忆和状态跟踪的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文和记忆基准主要集中在对话实例上，但评估动态企业环境中的记忆对于其有效应用至关重要。

Method: MEMTRACK通过整合Slack、Linear和Git等多个通信和生产力平台中的异步事件来模拟实际的组织工作流程。该基准测试提供了一个按时间顺序排列的平台交叉时间线，其中包含嘈杂、冲突、交叉引用的信息，以及潜在的代码库/文件系统理解和探索。

Result: 在SoTA LLM和记忆后端上的实验表明，在长时期内利用记忆、处理跨平台依赖关系和解决矛盾方面存在挑战。性能最佳的GPT-5模型在MEMTRACK上仅获得60%的正确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个可扩展的框架，用于推进记忆增强代理的评估研究，超越了现有对会话设置的关注，并为复杂组织环境中的多代理、多平台记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的临床决策支持系统，旨在辅助处方医生，通过分析历史EHR数据生成治疗建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策的复杂性日益增加，以及电子健康记录（EHR）的快速扩展，为提供数据驱动的医疗服务带来了机遇和挑战。

Method: 该系统通过整合自然语言处理和结构化临床输入，利用检索增强生成（RAG）流水线，结合非结构化叙述和编码数据来支持基于LLM的推理。

Result: 初步评估表明，基于LLM的工具在处方工作流程中可能提供有价值的决策支持，但需要适当约束和严格验证。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了将生成式AI集成到实际临床决策中的初步尝试，重点是透明度、安全性和与既定实践的一致性。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

*Xinpeng Wang,Nitish Joshi,Barbara Plank,Rico Angell,He He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TRACE的新方法，用于检测推理模型中的隐式奖励攻击，该方法通过衡量模型推理过程中多早才能通过验证器来量化努力程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励攻击对模型构成威胁，模型利用奖励函数中的漏洞来获得高奖励，而无需解决预期任务。这种行为可能是显式的，也可能是隐式的，隐式奖励攻击会绕过CoT监控。

Method: TRACE通过逐步截断模型的CoT，迫使模型回答，并测量每个截止点处的验证器通过率来量化努力程度。通过计算准确率与长度曲线下的面积来判断是否存在攻击。

Result: TRACE在数学推理中比最强的72B CoT监控器有超过65%的提升，在编码中比32B监控器有超过30%的提升。TRACE还可以在训练期间发现未知的漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种可扩展的无监督方法，用于在当前监控方法无效时进行监督。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过知识蒸馏，该论文提出一种将检索增强生成（RAG）的优势融入到大型语言模型（LLM）agent中的方法，无需在推理时依赖外部知识库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agent在多步骤任务中经常失败，RAG虽然可以通过提供运行时指导来提高性能，但需要维护外部知识库并增加计算开销。

Method: 该方法从agent失败中提取简洁、可重用的提示，使用这些提示生成改进的教师轨迹，并在这些轨迹上训练学生模型，同时移除提示字符串，促使模型内化知识。

Result: 在ALFWorld和WebShop两个交互式基准测试中，经过蒸馏的学生模型始终优于基线agent，在ALFWorld上成功率高达91%（基线为79%），WebShop分数提高到72（基线为61%），同时比检索增强的教师模型使用的token减少10-60%。

Conclusion: 该方法可以跨模型规模和agent架构推广，表明检索的优势可以通过有针对性的微调有效地内化，而无需永久的运行时依赖性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用大型语言模型（LLM）代理自动进行数据驱动建模和分析的创新pipeline，特别强调回归任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据驱动方法通常需要大量的人工干预，限制了它们有效扩展和泛化到不同应用的能力。现代工程越来越依赖于实验和模拟产生的大量数据集，因此越来越需要高效、可靠和广泛适用的建模策略。

Method: 本文评估了两种LLM代理框架：一种是具有专门协作代理的多代理系统，另一种是基于推理和行动（ReAct）范例的单代理系统。这两种框架都能自动处理数据预处理、神经网络开发、训练、超参数优化和不确定性量化（UQ）。

Result: 实验结果表明，本文LLM代理开发的模型超越了传统的CHF查找表，并提供了与人类专家开发的state-of-the-art贝叶斯优化深度神经网络模型相当的预测精度和UQ。

Conclusion: LLM代理在自动化复杂工程建模任务方面具有巨大的潜力，可以在满足或超过现有预测性能标准的同时，大大减少人工工作量。

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为 OntoLogX 的自主人工智能代理，该代理利用大型语言模型将原始日志转换为基于本体的知识图谱，从而提取可操作的网络威胁情报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从日志中提取可操作的网络威胁情报通常会受到缺乏结构、语义不一致以及跨设备和会话的碎片化等问题的限制。

Method: OntoLogX 集成了轻量级日志本体与检索增强生成 (RAG) 和迭代校正步骤，确保生成的知识图谱在语法和语义上有效。该系统将知识图谱聚合到会话中，并采用大型语言模型来预测 MITRE ATT&CK 战术，从而将低级日志证据链接到更高级别的对抗目标。

Result: 在公共基准和真实蜜罐数据集上对 OntoLogX 进行了评估，结果表明，该系统能够跨多个知识图谱后端生成强大的知识图谱，并能准确地将对抗活动映射到 ATT&CK 战术。

Conclusion: 结果强调了检索和校正对精确率和召回率的好处，面向代码的模型在结构化日志分析中的有效性，以及基于本体的表示对于可操作的 CTI 提取的价值。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

TL;DR: Falconer是一个结合了LLM和轻量级代理模型的协作框架，用于可扩展的知识挖掘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型（LLM）虽然擅长理解用户指令，但部署成本高昂。传统的分类器和提取器虽然高效，但缺乏泛化能力。

Method: LLM作为规划者，将用户指令分解为可执行的管道，并作为注释者，生成监督信号来训练小型代理模型。该框架将分类和提取统一为两个原子操作：get label和get span。

Result: Falconer在指令遵循准确性方面与最先进的LLM相近，同时降低了高达90%的推理成本，并将大规模知识挖掘加速了20倍以上。

Conclusion: Falconer为深度研究提供了一个高效且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

Motivation: 现有的方法将视觉输入视为固定的、确定性的条件，忽略了歧义的关键来源，并且难以建立对合理的视觉变化具有鲁棒性的策略。因此，需要一种新的探索方法来解决多模态LLM在探索方面的问题。

Method: VOGUE量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，使用原始分支和噪声分支之间的对称KL散度，创建一个直接的信号来感知不确定性。然后，通过不确定性比例奖励、token-entropy奖励和一个退火抽样计划来塑造学习目标，从而有效地平衡探索和利用。

Result: 在两个模型规模（Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B）上实施的VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准测试中将pass@1准确率平均提高了2.6%，在三个通用领域推理基准测试中平均提高了3.7%，同时提高了pass@4性能，并减轻了在RL微调中常见的探索衰减。

Conclusion: 将探索建立在视觉输入固有的不确定性中是提高多模态推理的有效策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为AIReg-Bench的基准数据集，用于评估大型语言模型(llm)在评估人工智能系统是否符合欧盟人工智能法案(AIA)方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前还没有方法来衡量llm在此任务上的表现。为了填补这一空白，我们介绍了AIReg-Bench。

Method: 通过一个两步过程创建了这个数据集:(1)通过使用精心设计的指令提示LLM，我们生成了120个技术文档摘录(样本)，每个摘录描述了一个虚构的，但看似合理的人工智能系统——人工智能提供商可能会生成这种系统来证明他们符合AIR;(2)法律专家随后审查并注释每个样本，以表明其中描述的人工智能系统是否以及以何种方式违反了AIA的特定条款。

Result: 该数据集与我们对前沿llm是否能重现专家合规标签的评估一起，为了解基于llm的AIR合规评估工具的机会和局限性提供了一个起点，并建立了一个可以比较后续llm的基准。

Conclusion: 该数据集和评估代码可在https://github.com/camlsys/aireg-bench获得。

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at
https://github.com/camlsys/aireg-bench.

*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT)方法，旨在解决在计算资源充足的情况下，标准Tree-of-Thoughts搜索中出现的广度饱和和深度短视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算资源充足的情况下，标准Tree-of-Thoughts搜索存在广度饱和和深度短视的问题。

Method: LToT将效用与逻辑一致性分离，并将低效用但一致的候选视为资产。通过Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC)探索laterals，这是一种有上限的连续减半竞赛，它在非常宽的lateral集合上展开微小的探测，使用宽度感知的阈值进行重复确认，并在分支的包络线清除主线后立即提升分支。

Result: 证明了伪线性横向成本 $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$，具有对数数量级的阶梯（初始横向宽度 $N_0$；剔除因子 $\eta>1$），与无上限主线的指数增长形成对比。基准任务的实证评估正在准备中，将在未来的修订中添加。

Conclusion: LToT将大量的测试时间预算转化为有原则的多样性，同时保持了提升纪律，在不增加计算量的情况下缓解了饱和和短视问题。

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，利用稀疏自动编码器和聚类技术来分析大型语言模型 (LLM) 的内部 token 表示，并指导数学推理任务中的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过分析LLM的内部token表示，提升其在数学推理任务中的生成质量。

Method: 首先训练一个SAE来生成稀疏向量表示，然后应用k-means聚类构建图，顶点代表token聚类，加权边捕获连续token转换。使用该图，定义了一个基于边权重的奖励函数来量化对已建立的推理轨迹的坚持程度，从而识别出剥削性的推理轨迹。此外，从聚类中测量生成多样性以评估探索的程度。

Result: 研究结果表明，平衡利用和探索对于在数学推理任务中实现高精度至关重要。

Conclusion: SAE可以作为可扩展的奖励模型来指导生成，确保利用和探索之间的平衡权衡。这可以防止任一方向的极端行为，最终在LLM中培养更高质量的推理过程。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LOGicalThought (LogT) 的神经符号架构，它使用高级逻辑语言和推理器以及LLM来构建双重符号图上下文和基于逻辑的上下文，从而将问题从长篇指南中的推理转化为紧凑的、有根据的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高保证推理中，尤其是在法律和医学等关键领域，需要准确、可验证且明确以证据为基础的结论。由于存在大量例外情况，这种推理依赖于从规则、法规和合同中编纂的前提，固有地涉及可废止或非单调逻辑，其中引入单个事实会使一般规则失效，从而带来重大挑战。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为LOGicalThought (LogT) 的神经符号架构，该架构使用高级逻辑语言和推理器以及LLM来构建双重符号图上下文和基于逻辑的上下文。

Result: 在四个多领域基准上针对四个基线进行评估，LogT将所有LLM的整体性能提高了11.84%。在所有三种推理模式下，性能都得到了显着提高：在否定方面提高了+10.2%，在蕴涵方面提高了+13.2%，在可废止推理方面提高了+5.5%（与最强的基线相比）。

Conclusion: LogT通过结合神经符号方法，显著提升了LLM在高保证推理任务中的性能，尤其是在处理否定、蕴涵和可废止推理等复杂逻辑结构时。

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfoSeeker是一个LLM决策框架，它将面向任务的规划与信息搜寻相结合，以在不确定性下做出最佳决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型(LLM)规划代理忽略了其内部动态与实际环境之间的差异。

Method: InfoSeeker提示LLM通过规划行动来主动收集信息，以验证其理解、检测环境变化或在生成或修改面向任务的计划之前测试假设。

Result: InfoSeeker在性能上比以前的方法提高了74%，并且可以推广到各种LLM，并在机器人操作和网络导航等基准测试中优于基线。

Conclusion: 将规划和信息搜寻紧密结合对于在部分可观察环境中实现稳健行为至关重要。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法依赖于稀疏的、基于结果的奖励，这可能会加强导致偶然正确答案的错误推理路径。这源于与推理的自然结构不匹配。

Method: 提出了Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO)算法，该算法使用基于过程的奖励函数，鼓励增量进步，引导模型学习结构化的、连贯的推理路径。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，SAPO算法显著提高了性能，并增强了生成过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的理论框架将复杂的问题解决形式化为分层选择过程，为算法设计提供了原则性基础，包括对潜在推理结构的可识别性的理论见解。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

TL;DR: InvThink是一种使大型语言模型(llm)具有逆向思维能力的方法，即在生成响应之前通过失败模式进行推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全对齐方法直接优化安全响应，而InvThink则指示模型1)列举潜在危害，2)分析其后果，3)生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。

Method: 通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM家族中实现InvThink。

Result: (i)与现有的安全方法相比，安全改进显示出更强的模型规模扩展性。(ii)InvThink减轻了安全负担；通过训练模型系统地考虑失败模式，它保留了标准基准上的一般推理能力。(iii)除了通用安全任务外，InvThink在包括面向外部(医学、金融、法律)和能动(敲诈勒索、谋杀)风险场景的高风险领域表现出色，与SafetyPrompt等基线方法相比，有害响应最多减少15.7%。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了一条可扩展和通用的途径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Motivation: 现有的防御方法要么依赖于自验证（效果不佳），要么依赖于外部警卫模块（增加开销和单点故障风险）。

Method: AdvEvo-MARL 是一种协同进化多智能体强化学习框架，它将安全性融入到任务智能体中，通过对抗性学习环境联合优化攻击者和防御者。引入公共基线来稳定学习并促进合作。

Result: AdvEvo-MARL 始终将攻击成功率 (ASR) 保持在 20% 以下，而基线方法高达 38.33%，同时保持甚至提高了任务准确性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，无需额外的警卫智能体或增加系统开销，安全性和效用可以共同提高。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

Motivation: Existing conversational recommender systems struggle with dynamic user preferences, conversation coherence and balancing multiple ranking objectives.

Method: Specialized LLM agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context awareness and dynamic ranking, coordinated through adaptive weighting.

Result: AgentRec improves conversation success rate by 2.8%, recommendation accuracy by 1.9%, and conversation efficiency by 3.2% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines with comparable computational costs.

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative

reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent

Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLM在需要认知能力的心理咨询领域的应用潜力。通过考察LLM是否能通过美国国家咨询师认证考试（NCE）来评估其是否具备心理咨询师的资格。

Method: 研究方法是构建一个名为PsychoBench的基准，该基准包含2252道单选题，这些问题来源于美国国家咨询师认证考试，旨在考察LLM对心理学各个分支的理解深度和广度。

Result: 研究结果表明，GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B等先进模型能够达到通过NCE的阈值，而较小的开源模型（如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B）则远低于该阈值。

Conclusion: 研究结论是，目前只有前沿的LLM能够达到咨询考试的标准，这既表明了开发面向心理学的LLM的潜力，也突显了其中的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的CMDP方法在高维或非结构化上下文中泛化能力不足，导致计算量过大和性能不稳定。

Method: 利用大型语言模型将上下文输入压缩成低维、语义丰富的摘要，并结合近似上下文充分性的概念。

Result: 该方法在离散、连续、视觉和推荐基准测试中优于原始上下文和非上下文基线，提高了奖励、成功率和样本效率，同时降低了延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的摘要提供了一种可扩展且可解释的解决方案，用于在资源受限的富上下文环境中进行高效决策。

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLM在地理空间推理方面的能力，例如读取道路网络地图和执行导航任务。

Method: 该研究将轨迹恢复定义为一个代理任务，要求模型重建被屏蔽的GPS轨迹，并引入了一个名为GLOBALTRACE的数据集，该数据集包含来自不同地区和交通方式的4000多个真实世界轨迹。该研究使用道路网络作为上下文，利用prompting框架使LLM能够生成有效的路径，而无需访问任何外部导航工具。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM优于现成的基线模型和专门的轨迹恢复模型，并具有强大的零样本泛化能力。细粒度分析表明，LLM对道路网络和坐标系有很强的理解能力，但也存在相对于区域和交通方式的系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLM可以通过灵活的方式推理地图来增强导航体验，从而整合用户偏好。

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将定性投资理念转化为可重复的定量策略

Method: 通过将著名投资者的理念编码到 LLM 提示中来开发五种不同的 GuruAgents，这些提示集成了金融工具和确定性推理管道。

Result: 在 2023 年第四季度至 2025 年第二季度的 NASDAQ-100 成分股的回测中，巴菲特 GuruAgent 实现了最高的性能，实现了 42.2% 的 CAGR，显著优于基准。

Conclusion: Prompt 工程可以成功地将投资大师的定性理念转化为可重现的定量策略，突出了自动化系统投资的新方向。

Abstract: This study demonstrates that GuruAgents, prompt-guided AI agents, can
systematically operationalize the strategies of legendary investment gurus. We
develop five distinct GuruAgents, each designed to emulate an iconic investor,
by encoding their distinct philosophies into LLM prompts that integrate
financial tools and a deterministic reasoning pipeline. In a backtest on
NASDAQ-100 constituents from Q4 2023 to Q2 2025, the GuruAgents exhibit unique
behaviors driven by their prompted personas. The Buffett GuruAgent achieves the
highest performance, delivering a 42.2\% CAGR that significantly outperforms
benchmarks, while other agents show varied results. These findings confirm that
prompt engineering can successfully translate the qualitative philosophies of
investment gurus into reproducible, quantitative strategies, highlighting a
novel direction for automated systematic investing. The source code and data

TL;DR: 本文发现并定义了计算机使用代理(CUAs)中的盲目目标导向(BGD)问题，即代理不考虑可行性、安全性等因素而追求目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUAs被越来越多地部署，但它们会盲目追求目标，忽略实际情况，这会带来风险。

Method: 构建了一个名为BLIND-ACT的基准测试，包含90个任务，用于评估CUAs的BGD。

Result: 在包括Claude Sonnet、Opus 4和GPT-5在内的九个模型上进行了评估，发现平均BGD率高达80.8%。

Conclusion: BGD是一个普遍存在的问题，即使在输入没有直接危害的情况下也会产生风险。需要更强的训练或推理时干预来解决这个问题。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

TL;DR: LENOHA是一个安全第一、本地优先的系统，它使用高精度句子转换器分类器路由输入，并从临床医生策划的常见问题解答中返回临床查询的逐字答案，从而消除了临床路径中的自由文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者在等待介入手术时，通常会有一些术前问题没有得到解答；然而，时间紧迫的工作流程和隐私限制了个性化的咨询。

Method: 我们提出了LENOHA（低能耗、无幻觉、不遗漏任何人的架构），这是一个安全第一、本地优先的系统，它使用高精度句子转换器分类器路由输入，并从临床医生策划的常见问题解答中返回临床查询的逐字答案，从而消除了临床路径中的自由文本生成。

Result: 在四个编码器中，E5-large-instruct (560M) 实现了 0.983 的总体准确率（95% CI 0.964-0.991），AUC 0.996，总共 7 个错误，这与 GPT-4o 在此任务上没有统计学上的区别；Gemini 在此测试集中没有出现错误。能量记录显示，非生成临床路径的每个输入的功耗约为 1.0 mWh，而来自本地 8B SLM 的闲聊回复的功耗约为 168 mWh，相差约 170 倍，同时在单个本地 GPU 上的延迟约为 0.10 秒。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，通过逐字返回经过审查的常见问题解答答案，可以在临床路径中避免接近前沿的区分和生成引起的错误，从而支持带宽受限环境中的隐私、可持续性和公平部署。

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

Motivation: 目前的AGI评估方法主要依赖于基于人类直觉设计的合成任务，但效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种替代设计理念，即评估鲁棒的任务执行能力，通过能力来展示AGI。这种视角借鉴了数据科学中的常见实践，用于展示系统可以可靠地部署。

Result: 为AGI评估提供了实际的例子。

Conclusion: AGI评估方法应该专注于评估鲁棒的任务执行能力，通过能力来展示AGI。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的hard-negative response generation框架，用于优化大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）与人类偏好对齐。该框架通过LLM引导的response editing生成带有针对性错误的rejected responses，并保持与accepted responses的风格和长度相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术忽略了合成偏好注释中的噪声，例如风格和长度偏差。为了解决这个问题，论文提出了新的框架。

Method: 该方法基于LLM引导的response editing，生成hard-negative responses。使用该框架构建了一个包含30K高质量样本的VaPR数据集，用于微调LVLM。

Result: VaPR模型在十个基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升，平均增益分别为6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), 和 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL)，并在推理任务上取得了显著的改进。 scaling分析表明，性能随着数据规模的增加而不断提高。此外，VaPR减少了在二元问题中回答“是”的倾向。

Conclusion: 该框架可以推广到开源LLM作为编辑器，在VaPR-OS上训练的模型实现了使用GPT-4o合成的模型的~99%的性能。

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaboT is an AI system that translates user questions into SPARQL queries for metabolomics knowledge graphs, making it easier for researchers to access structured data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective use of knowledge graphs requires understanding of ontology and query language syntax, which can be a barrier for researchers.

Method: The system uses a multi-agent system with specialized AI agents to handle user queries, validate questions, and generate SPARQL queries.

Result: MetaboT achieved 83.67% accuracy in answering metabolomics-related questions, compared to 8.16% accuracy of a standard LLM (GPT-4o).

Conclusion: MetaboT is a promising tool for retrieving structured metabolomics data through natural language queries, removing technical barriers and facilitating data-driven discoveries.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

Conclusion: 这项研究弥合了理论人工智能结构与运营网络安全需求之间的差距，为强大、经验证的多代理系统奠定了基础，这些系统符合行业标准。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation
for robust, empirically validated multi-agent systems that adhere to industry
standards.

Conclusion: 通过关注系统内部的动态，可以更全面地处理相关的多维责任、安全性和鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 PTA-GRPO 的双阶段框架，以提升大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力，通过结合高层次规划和细粒度的 CoT 推理来克服局部决策的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂任务中表现出卓越的推理能力，但由于自回归 token 级别的生成方式，推理过程主要受限于局部决策，缺乏全局规划，导致冗余、不连贯或不准确的推理。

Method: 首先，利用先进的 LLM 将 CoT 提炼成紧凑的高层次指导，用于监督式微调（SFT）。然后，引入一种指导感知强化学习方法，联合优化最终输出和高层次指导的质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中进行了大量实验，结果表明 PTA-GRPO 在不同的模型和任务中始终如一地实现了稳定且显著的改进。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO 能够有效提升 LLM 的推理能力，并在不同模型和任务中具有良好的泛化性，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决现有方法在模仿风格上的局限性，并提高推理的正确性。

Method: 使用对抗逆强化学习，学习一个token级别的密集奖励模型，该模型在训练时提供step-level的反馈，在推理时作为评论员重新排序抽样的轨迹。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，使用Llama3和Qwen2.5作为backbone，实验表明该方法可以作为学习信号来激发推理，并通过奖励引导的重新排序提高预测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过将训练信号、推理时选择和token级别的诊断统一到一个推理奖励中，可以增强语言模型中的多步推理。

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的约束生成方法，该方法在保证样本有效性和多样性的同时，提高了采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在程序模糊测试等领域，生成的输出必须满足严格的语义或语法约束，并且样本的有效性和多样性至关重要。现有的约束生成方法要么扭曲语言模型的分布，要么浪费计算资源。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为约束自适应拒绝采样 (CARS) 的方法，该方法通过记录在 trie 中违反约束的延续并从未来的抽取中减去它们的概率质量，自适应地排除约束违反的延续。

Result: 在各种领域的实验中，CARS 在每次有效样本的 LM 前向传递次数方面始终获得更高的效率，同时产生比 GCD 和近似 LM 分布的方法更强的样本多样性。

Conclusion: CARS 是一种严格改进 RS 样本效率而不产生分布失真的方法。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

### [136] [Zero-shot reasoning for simulating scholarly peer-review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02027)
*Khalid M. Saqr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种确定性模拟框架，用于评估人工智能生成的同行评审报告，以应对学术出版中提交量过大和人工智能监管不足的双重危机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人工同行评审缺乏可扩展的客观基准，导致编辑过程不透明且难以审计。因此，需要新的治理模式来维护科学的完整性。

Method: 通过分析352份同行评审模拟报告，研究识别出一致的系统状态指标，证明了该框架的可靠性。

Result: 该系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断，并且在不同学科中，“修改”决定始终占多数(>50%)，而“拒绝”率动态适应特定领域的规范，在健康科学中上升到45%。此外，它保持了坚定不移的程序完整性，实施了稳定的29%证据锚定合规率，该比率在不同的审查任务和科学领域中保持不变。

Conclusion: 该框架为科学界提供了一个透明的工具来确保公平性，并为出版战略家提供了一个可扩展的工具来审计工作流程、管理诚信风险和实施循证治理。该框架将人工智能重新定位为机构问责制的重要组成部分，为维护学术交流的信任提供了关键基础设施。

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReTabAD通过恢复文本语义来实现上下文感知的表格异常检测研究，弥补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表格异常检测基准忽略了丰富的文本元数据，如特征描述和领域知识，这限制了研究的灵活性，并妨碍了模型充分利用领域知识进行检测。

Method: 该研究提供了20个精心策划的表格数据集，这些数据集通过结构化的文本元数据进行了丰富。此外，还提供了一个零样本LLM框架，该框架利用语义上下文，无需特定于任务的训练。

Result: 语义上下文提高了检测性能，并通过支持领域感知的推理来增强可解释性。

Conclusion: ReTabAD是一个用于系统探索上下文感知AD的基准。

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

*Xinyuan Song,Keyu Wang,PengXiang Li,Lu Yin,Shiwei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）的深层对表征学习贡献不大，可以移除而不会显著降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究对LLM深度利用的评估范围狭窄，可能忽略了模型行为的重要方面。

Method: 对不同维度（评估协议、任务类别和模型架构）的深度利用进行了系统研究。

Result: 深层通常不如早期层有效，但其贡献随评估设置而显着变化。在没有生成的情况下，基于可能性的指标，修剪大多数层可以保持性能，只有最初的几层至关重要。相比之下，基于生成的评估揭示了中间层和更深层在实现推理和维持远程连贯性方面的不可或缺的作用。知识和检索集中在浅层组件中，而推理准确性很大程度上依赖于更深层。

Conclusion: LLM中的深度使用具有高度异质性和上下文依赖性，因此在解释和压缩大型模型时，需要考虑任务、指标和模型。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了模型在 ConceptARC 上进行抽象推理的能力，发现仅凭准确率评估可能会高估文本模态下的抽象推理能力，低估视觉模态下的抽象推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有模型是否真正理解并运用了 ConceptARC 任务设计者希望模型掌握的抽象概念，而不仅仅是依赖表面模式。

Method: 通过改变输入模态（文本 vs. 视觉）、是否允许使用外部 Python 工具以及推理模型的推理强度来评估模型，并同时评估模型的输出准确率及其生成的自然语言规则。

Result: 结果表明，一些文本模型虽然达到了人类的输出准确率，但其规则往往基于表面捷径，未能像人类那样捕捉到预期的抽象概念。在视觉模态下，模型的输出准确率急剧下降，但规则层面的分析表明，模型可能被低估，因为它们仍然表现出相当一部分捕捉预期抽象概念的规则，但往往无法正确应用这些规则。

Conclusion: 模型在抽象推理方面仍然落后于人类，并且仅使用准确率来评估 ARC 类任务上的抽象推理可能会高估文本模态下的抽象推理能力，而低估视觉模态下的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

TL;DR: FlexDoc: A framework for generating synthetic documents to train document understanding models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing document understanding models requires large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets, which are expensive to collect due to privacy, legal restrictions, and annotation costs.

Method: FlexDoc combines Stochastic Schemas and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured documents with rich annotations by probabilistically modeling layout patterns, visual structure, and content variability.

Result: FlexDoc-generated data improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets and reduces annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional hard-template methods.

Conclusion: FlexDoc accelerates the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs and is in active deployment.

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Motivation: 现有的基准在评估维度、响应格式和评分机制方面存在不足，无法有效评估DRAs系统。

Method: 本文构建了一个包含214个专家策划的挑战性查询的基准，并提出了一个多维度评估框架，该框架集成了语义质量、主题焦点和检索可信度等评分指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，主流DRAs的性能优于网络搜索工具增强的推理模型，但仍有很大的改进空间。

Conclusion: 本研究为DRA系统的能力评估、架构改进和范式发展奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

*Ivo Silva,Pedro Nogueira,Guilherme Bonaldo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: QuintoAndar Group, Latin America's largest housing platform, enhances housing accessibility. They propose a geo-aware embedding framework using an hierarchical H3 grid within a two-tower neural architecture to improve housing recommendations by considering location.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users struggle to find the ideal home due to the large number of houses available and the importance of location in influencing property value, access to amenities, and quality of life. Incorporating location into recommendations is essential for their effectiveness.

Method: A geo-aware embedding framework is proposed, integrating a hierarchical H3 grid at multiple levels into a two-tower neural architecture.

Result: Embedding specific evaluation reveals richer and more balanced embedding representations. Offline ranking simulations demonstrate a substantial uplift in recommendation quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves housing recommendation quality by effectively incorporating location information.

Abstract: QuintoAndar Group is Latin America's largest housing platform,
revolutionizing property rentals and sales. Headquartered in Brazil, it
simplifies the housing process by eliminating paperwork and enhancing
accessibility for tenants, buyers, and landlords. With thousands of houses
available for each city, users struggle to find the ideal home. In this
context, location plays a pivotal role, as it significantly influences property
value, access to amenities, and life quality. A great location can make even a
modest home highly desirable. Therefore, incorporating location into
recommendations is essential for their effectiveness. We propose a geo-aware
embedding framework to address sparsity and spatial nuances in housing
recommendations on digital rental platforms. Our approach integrates an
hierarchical H3 grid at multiple levels into a two-tower neural architecture.
We compare our method with a traditional matrix factorization baseline and a
single-resolution variant using interaction data from our platform. Embedding
specific evaluation reveals richer and more balanced embedding representations,
while offline ranking simulations demonstrate a substantial uplift in
recommendation quality.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）自动生成图表的能力，以应对当前假信息泛滥的问题，并评估了它们在数据检索、预处理、代码质量和可视化表示方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息偏见、深度伪造和宣传日益泛滥的时代，可靠数据源的可访问性至关重要。国家统计机构提供的数据分布在许多表格中，处理起来可能很困难，因此本研究旨在探索利用LLM自动生成图表以更有效利用这些数据的可能性。

Method: 本研究使用来自荷兰统计局的公共数据，评估了多个LLM在识别相关数据表、执行必要的数据处理和自主生成适当可视化图表方面的能力，并提出了一个新的评估框架，包括数据检索与预处理、代码质量和可视化表示三个维度。

Result: 研究结果表明，定位和处理正确的数据是最重要的挑战。在没有明确指导的情况下，LLM很少实现可视化最佳实践。当补充了有效图表设计的信息后，模型在表示分数方面表现出显著提高。采用迭代自评估的代理方法在所有评估维度上都表现出色。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过适当的支架和反馈机制，可以提高LLM在自动图表生成方面的有效性，并且系统已经可以在三个评估维度上达到必要的准确性。

Abstract: In this time when biased information, deep fakes, and propaganda proliferate,
the accessibility of reliable data sources is more important than ever.
National statistical institutes provide curated data that contain quantitative
information on a wide range of topics. However, that information is typically
spread across many tables and the plain numbers may be arduous to process.
Hence, this open data may be practically inaccessible. We ask the question "Are
current Generative AI models capable of facilitating the identification of the
right data and the fully-automatic creation of charts to provide information in
visual form, corresponding to user queries?". We present a structured
evaluation of recent large language models' (LLMs) capabilities to generate
charts from complex data in response to user queries. Working with diverse
public data from Statistics Netherlands, we assessed multiple LLMs on their
ability to identify relevant data tables, perform necessary manipulations, and
generate appropriate visualizations autonomously. We propose a new evaluation
framework spanning three dimensions: data retrieval & pre-processing, code
quality, and visual representation. Results indicate that locating and
processing the correct data represents the most significant challenge.
Additionally, LLMs rarely implement visualization best practices without
explicit guidance. When supplemented with information about effective chart
design, models showed marked improvement in representation scores. Furthermore,
an agentic approach with iterative self-evaluation led to excellent performance
across all evaluation dimensions. These findings suggest that LLMs'
effectiveness for automated chart generation can be enhanced through
appropriate scaffolding and feedback mechanisms, and that systems can already
reach the necessary accuracy across the three evaluation dimensions.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为MetaSynth的框架，该框架利用隐式搜索反馈来优化搜索和推荐平台中的meta标题和描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化搜索和推荐平台中的标题和描述具有挑战性，因为搜索引擎排名模型是黑盒环境，缺乏显式标签，并且点击率等反馈仅在部署后才能获得。

Method: MetaSynth是一个多代理检索增强生成框架，它从排名靠前的结果中构建示例库，生成以产品内容和示例为条件的候选片段，并通过评估器-生成器循环迭代地细化输出，从而增强相关性、促销力度和合规性。

Result: 在专有的电子商务数据和Amazon Reviews语料库上，MetaSynth优于NDCG、MRR和排名指标方面的强大基线。大规模A/B测试进一步证明了10.26%的点击率和7.51%的点击量。

Conclusion: 这项工作贡献了一种通用范例，用于使用隐式信号优化黑盒系统中的内容。

Abstract: Meta titles and descriptions strongly shape engagement in search and
recommendation platforms, yet optimizing them remains challenging. Search
engine ranking models are black box environments, explicit labels are
unavailable, and feedback such as click-through rate (CTR) arrives only
post-deployment. Existing template, LLM, and retrieval-augmented approaches
either lack diversity, hallucinate attributes, or ignore whether candidate
phrasing has historically succeeded in ranking. This leaves a gap in directly
leveraging implicit signals from observable outcomes. We introduce MetaSynth, a
multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation framework that learns from implicit
search feedback. MetaSynth builds an exemplar library from top-ranked results,
generates candidate snippets conditioned on both product content and exemplars,
and iteratively refines outputs via evaluator-generator loops that enforce
relevance, promotional strength, and compliance. On both proprietary e-commerce
data and the Amazon Reviews corpus, MetaSynth outperforms strong baselines
across NDCG, MRR, and rank metrics. Large-scale A/B tests further demonstrate
10.26% CTR and 7.51% clicks. Beyond metadata, this work contributes a general
paradigm for optimizing content in black-box systems using implicit signals.

Motivation: 传统深度研究主要关注网络搜索，忽略本地私有数据，导致检索效率低、不符合FAIR原则，效率低且可重用性有限。

Method: 将异构资源封装为符合FAIR原则的数字对象，并细化为原子知识单元和知识图谱，形成用于多粒度检索的异构图索引。在此基础上，多代理系统支持可靠的问答和结构化科学报告生成。

Result: 在检索、问答和报告撰写任务上的实验结果表明，IoDResearch始终优于代表性的RAG和深度研究基线。

Conclusion: IoDResearch证明了在IoD范式下以私有数据为中心的深度研究的可行性，为更可信、可重用和自动化的科学发现铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rapid growth of multi-source, heterogeneous, and multimodal scientific
data has increasingly exposed the limitations of traditional data management.
Most existing DeepResearch (DR) efforts focus primarily on web search while
overlooking local private data. Consequently, these frameworks exhibit low
retrieval efficiency for private data and fail to comply with the FAIR
principles, ultimately resulting in inefficiency and limited reusability. To
this end, we propose IoDResearch (Internet of Data Research), a private
data-centric Deep Research framework that operationalizes the Internet of Data
paradigm. IoDResearch encapsulates heterogeneous resources as FAIR-compliant
digital objects, and further refines them into atomic knowledge units and
knowledge graphs, forming a heterogeneous graph index for multi-granularity
retrieval. On top of this representation, a multi-agent system supports both
reliable question answering and structured scientific report generation.
Furthermore, we establish the IoD DeepResearch Benchmark to systematically
evaluate both data representation and Deep Research capabilities in IoD
scenarios. Experimental results on retrieval, QA, and report-writing tasks show
that IoDResearch consistently surpasses representative RAG and Deep Research
baselines. Overall, IoDResearch demonstrates the feasibility of
private-data-centric Deep Research under the IoD paradigm, paving the way
toward more trustworthy, reusable, and automated scientific discovery.

Motivation: 解决从实时查询自动完成交互中收集的参与信号中的固有偏差，其中模型建议会影响用户行为。

Method: 从在自动完成未激活的常规搜索会话期间收集的完整用户查询生成合成前缀。利用查询流行度、季节性、模糊匹配分数和上下文信号等特征训练神经排序器。

Result: 该系统在大型电子商务环境中部署，在用户参与度方面表现出具有统计意义的改进。

Conclusion: 合成前缀不仅提高了泛化能力，而且为其他低延迟排序任务（包括相关搜索和查询推荐）中的偏差缓解提供了一条可扩展的途径。

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in
real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic
prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected
during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows
us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse
and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement
signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model
suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for
real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich
set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,
and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical
alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we
introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing
computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query
autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.
Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates
statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean
reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes
not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias
mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and
query recommendations.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型推荐方法存在以下不足：协同过滤模型使用静态快照，忽略了快速变化的用户偏好；许多实际商品包含丰富的视觉和音频内容，而不仅仅是文本描述；当前的系统难以提供基于具体证据的可信解释。

Method: 该框架通过三个关键创新来解决这些限制：开发了一种在线自适应机制，通过轻量级模块持续整合新的用户交互，避免了重新训练大型模型；创建了一个统一的表示，无缝结合了协同信号与视觉和音频特征，处理了某些模态可能不可用的情况；设计了一个解释系统，将推荐建立在特定的协同模式和商品属性上，生成用户可以验证的自然语言理由。

Result: 该方法在保持冻结的基础模型效率的同时，增加了最小的计算开销，使其适用于实际部署。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新颖的推荐框架，能够有效解决现有推荐系统中的若干挑战，并在实际应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation
tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text
prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising
approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM
representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive
fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several
challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static
snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items
contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current
systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete
evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these
limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation
mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through
lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a
unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with
visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be
unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds
recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes,
producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains
the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational
overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in
handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing
transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced
generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through
five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented
generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable
recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our
framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while
incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual
knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous
model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent
improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to
existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in
NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推荐系统忽略了元数据或属性过滤等重要组件。

Method: 使用LLM作为端到端推荐系统，解释用户意图，规划工具调用，并协调各种组件，包括布尔过滤器 (SQL)、稀疏检索 (BM25)、密集检索 (embedding similarity) 和生成式检索 (semantic IDs)。

Result: 该统一工具调用框架在各种推荐场景中实现了具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究设想了一种新的对话式音乐推荐系统范例，通过选择性地使用适当的检索方法基于用户查询

Abstract: While the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have
successfully enabled generative recommenders with natural language
interactions, their recommendation behavior is limited, leaving other simpler
yet crucial components such as metadata or attribute filtering underutilized in
the system. We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool
calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system
positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user
intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components:
boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding
similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning,
the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the
arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse
modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We
demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive
performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing
appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm
for conversational music recommendation systems.

### [151] [Ranking Items from Discrete Ratings: The Cost of Unknown User Thresholds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01871)
*Oscar Villemaud,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了如何从粗粒度的用户评分中恢复细粒度的物品排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多信息检索和推荐系统中，物品排序是核心任务。用户通常以粗略的离散等级进行评分，研究旨在从这些粗粒度评分中恢复细粒度的物品排序。

Method: 论文将物品建模为具有分数，用户建模为具有阈值；如果物品的分数超过用户的阈值，则用户对该物品进行正面评价。用户按顺序到达，并且可以查询每个新用户以优化当前排名。

Result: 研究证明，要达到接近完美的排序（以 Spearman 距离衡量），需要 Θ(n^2) 个用户（因此需要 Ω(n^2) 个查询）。

Conclusion: 阈值多样性对于将来自许多用户的粗略评级合并为细粒度排名是必要的，但如果阈值是先验未知的，则这种多样性是有代价的。

Abstract: Ranking items is a central task in many information retrieval and recommender
systems. User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on
a coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a
fine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as
having scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively
if the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on
the total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores
and the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally
partitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside
each bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can
be queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a
near-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\Theta(n^2)$
users (and therefore $\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than
the $O(n\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the
additional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate
thresholds. Our bound also quantifies the impact of a mismatch between score
and threshold distributions via a quadratic divergence factor. To show the
tightness of our results, we provide a ranking algorithm whose query complexity
matches our bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our work reveals a tension in
online ranking: diversity in thresholds is necessary to merge coarse ratings
from many users into a fine-grained ranking, but this diversity has a cost if
the thresholds are a priori unknown.

*Linh Tran,Yulong Li,Radu Florian,Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比评分指标的检索头选择方法，用于提升大型语言模型（LLM）的重排序性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力的重排序器中，并非所有注意力头都同等重要，许多头会引入噪声和冗余，限制性能。

Method: 通过对比评分指标识别出一小部分与相关文档高度相关的检索头（CoRe heads），并降低与不相关文档相关的头的权重。

Result: 实验表明，使用不到1%的CoRe heads即可显著提高重排序精度，且CoRe heads集中在中间层。

Conclusion: 通过剪枝模型最后50%的层，可以在保持精度的同时显著减少推理时间和内存使用。

Abstract: The strong zero-shot and long-context capabilities of recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) have paved the way for highly effective re-ranking systems.
Attention-based re-rankers leverage attention weights from transformer heads to
produce relevance scores, but not all heads are created equally: many
contribute noise and redundancy, thus limiting performance. To address this, we
introduce CoRe heads, a small set of retrieval heads identified via a
contrastive scoring metric that explicitly rewards high attention heads that
correlate with relevant documents, while downplaying nodes with higher
attention that correlate with irrelevant documents. This relative ranking
criterion isolates the most discriminative heads for re-ranking and yields a
state-of-the-art list-wise re-ranker. Extensive experiments with three LLMs
show that aggregated signals from CoRe heads, constituting less than 1% of all
heads, substantially improve re-ranking accuracy over strong baselines. We
further find that CoRe heads are concentrated in middle layers, and pruning the
computation of final 50% of model layers preserves accuracy while significantly
reducing inference time and memory usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始Promptagator方法依赖于用户可能无法访问或被禁止用于敏感数据的大型专有LLM。

Method: 研究了可访问规模（≤14B参数）的开源LLM作为替代方案的影响。

Result: 结果表明，小至3B参数的开源LLM可以作为有效的Promptagator风格的查询生成器。

Conclusion: 这项工作为从业者提供了可靠的合成数据生成替代方案，并为最大化领域特定应用的微调结果提供了见解。

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot
prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning
domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator
approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have
access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we
study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B
parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as
small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query
generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable
alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize
fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.

### [154] [Ensemble Threshold Calibration for Stable Sensitivity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02116)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端的框架，可以在大规模空间归并和实体匹配任务中实现精确召回控制，同时保持较低的方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模空间归并和实体匹配任务中，精确的召回控制至关重要，因为遗漏少数真正的匹配会破坏下游分析，而过多的手动审查会增加成本。传统置信区间截断方法（如 Clopper-Pearson 或 Wilson）虽然提供了召回率的下限，但通常会超出目标几个百分点，并且在倾斜的分数分布下表现出较高的运行方差。

Method: 该pipeline首先使用等网格边界框过滤器和压缩稀疏行 (CSR) 候选表示，将pair枚举减少两个数量级。确定性 xxHash 自举样本训练一个轻量级神经排序器；它的分数通过单个前向传播传播到所有剩余的pair，并用于构建可重现的、按分数十分位数分层的校准集。四种互补的阈值估计器（Clopper-Pearson、Jeffreys、Wilson 和精确分位数）通过逆方差加权进行聚合，然后在九个独立的子样本中融合。这种集成减少了阈值方差。

Result: 在两个真实的地籍数据集（约 631 万和 6734 万个pair）上进行评估，该方法始终在较小的误差范围内达到召回目标，相对于其他校准方法减少了冗余验证，并在单个 TPU v3 核心上端到端运行。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法可以在大规模空间归并和实体匹配任务中实现精确召回控制，同时保持较低的方差，并且可以在单个 TPU v3 核心上端到端运行。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

Motivation: 传统密度泛函理论（DFT）方法计算成本高昂，限制了长期模拟的可行性。

Method: 该方法将MD模拟转化为时间序列预测问题，并结合了基于DFT参数化的成对Morse势函数的物理信息损失和推理机制。

Result: 该方法在模拟精度方面始终优于标准基线，并实现了数千个MD步骤的稳定建模。

Conclusion: 结合物理知识可以提高原子轨迹预测的可靠性和精度，并为昂贵的DFT模拟提供了一种可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为选择性抽样（selective sampling）的方法，该方法基于抽样风险指标动态地在贪婪抽样和高温抽样之间切换，以提高语言模型生成的多样性，同时保持高质量，特别是在需要高精度的任务中，如数学推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于温度的采样方法（如min-p或top-p）在提高语言模型生成内容多样性时，会降低需要高精度的任务（如数学推理）的质量，因为在敏感的解码位置采样到不正确的延续。

Method: 提出选择性抽样方法，该方法基于抽样风险指标动态地在贪婪抽样和高温抽样之间切换。通过在一个可验证问题的小子集上训练一个轻量级分类器来预测抽样风险，并将其与基础语言模型集成。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性抽样增强了质量-多样性的权衡，即使在高温设置下也是如此。

Conclusion: 选择性抽样方法能够在提高语言模型生成内容多样性的同时，保持高质量，特别是在需要高精度的任务中。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自动工作流程，用于从约 10,000 篇科学文章中提取热电和结构性质，创建了一个包含 27,822 个温度分辨属性记录的数据集，并通过网络界面向社区开放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有材料数据库规模小、手动管理或偏向第一性原理结果，导致实验文献未被充分利用。快速发现材料受到缺乏将性能指标与结构背景相结合的大型、机器可读数据集的限制。

Method: 该工作流程集成了动态令牌分配、零样本多代理提取和条件表解析，以平衡准确性与计算成本。使用 GPT-4.1 和 GPT-4.1 Mini 模型进行基准测试。

Result: GPT-4.1 在热电性能和结构领域的 F1 分数分别为 0.91 和 0.82，GPT-4.1 Mini 的 F1 分数分别为 0.89 和 0.81，但成本更低。该工作流程整理了包含 27,822 个温度分辨属性记录的数据集，并重现了已知的热电趋势。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了迄今为止最大的 LLM 管理的热电数据集，提供了一个可重现且具有成本效益的提取管道，并为热电之外的可扩展、数据驱动的材料发现奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

*Zukang Xu,Xing Hu,Qiang Wu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSAVQ: A novel VQ framework for low-bit quantization of LLMs, enhancing performance via geometry-driven innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-bit quantization methods for LLMs using Vector Quantization (VQ) suffer from unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation.

Method: Introduces Error Direction Sensitivity Guidance (EDSG) using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to project quantization errors and Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) for dynamic bit allocation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in LLM quantization. For example, in 2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ outperforms baselines by 0.4 PPL and 1.5 zero-shot accuracy.

Conclusion: Offers a practical solution for constrained environments and bridges information geometry with neural network quantization, advancing efficient deep learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习容易受到中毒和后门攻击，尤其是在部分可观察的情况下。因此，需要开发防御机制以提高联邦学习的安全性。

Method: 将防御建模为一个部分可观察的序列决策问题，并引入一个信任感知深度Q网络。该网络整合多信号证据到客户端信任更新中，并优化长期稳健性-准确性目标。

Result: 在 CIFAR-10 数据集上，(i) 建立了一个基线，显示准确率稳步提高；(ii) 通过 Dirichlet sweep 显示，增加客户端重叠始终提高准确率并降低 ASR，同时保持稳定的检测；(iii) 在信号预算研究中表明，随着可观察性的降低，准确率保持稳定，而 ASR 增加，ROC-AUC 下降，这突出了序列信念更新可以缓解较弱的信号。

Conclusion: DQN 在稳健性和准确性之间取得了最佳的平衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Budgeted Broadcast (BB) 的剪枝方法，该方法根据流量预算来剪枝参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的剪枝方法通常根据参数对损失的影响来排序并移除参数，而本文旨在寻找更有效的剪枝方法。

Method: BB 方法为每个单元分配一个局部流量预算，并通过约束熵分析来平衡选择性和受众，使用局部执行器来剪枝扇入或扇出。

Result: BB 方法在 ASR Transformer、人脸识别 ResNet 和突触预测 3D U-Net 上提高了编码熵和去相关性，并在匹配的稀疏性下提高了准确性，有时甚至超过了密集基线。在电子显微镜图像上，BB 方法在评估协议下达到了最先进的 F1 和 PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB 方法易于集成，并为学习更多样化和高效的表示提供了一条途径。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for
real-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive

scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.
We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous
agents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a
competitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal
Policy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under
adversarial dynamics. Experiments across several benchmark scenarios

Motivation: The current training paradigm for large reasoning models relies on next-token prediction pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning as the last phase. The paper questions the optimality of this approach.

Method: RLP treats chain-of-thought as an exploratory action and computes rewards based on the information gain it provides for predicting future tokens. It measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to conditioning on context alone.

Result: Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base improves the average across an eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. Applying RLP to Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on scientific reasoning by 23%.

Conclusion: RLP reframes reinforcement learning for reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning. It demonstrates scalability across architectures and model sizes.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

### [164] [Safe Reinforcement Learning-Based Vibration Control: Overcoming Training Risks with LQR Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01269)
*Rohan Vitthal Thorat,Juhi Singh,Rajdip Nayek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合控制框架，该框架集成了线性二次调节器 (LQR) 和强化学习 (RL) 控制器，以解决基于 RL 的振动控制中的关键训练安全挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外部激励引起的结构振动会带来重大风险，包括乘员的安全隐患、结构损坏和增加的维护成本。传统的基于模型的控制策略（如线性二次调节器 (LQR)）可以有效地减轻振动，但它们依赖于精确的系统模型，因此需要繁琐的系统识别。

Method: 该方法使用线性二次调节器 (LQR) 控制器来引导 RL 控制器。LQR 策略源自随机选择的模型及其参数。由于此 LQR 策略不需要了解真实或近似结构模型，因此整个框架仍然是无模型的。

Result: 即使基于完全不正确的模型的 LQR 控制器也优于不受控的情况。混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最大限度地降低了朴素 RL 实施中固有的探索风险。

Conclusion: 该研究首次解决了基于 RL 的振动控制的关键训练安全挑战，并提供了一个经过验证的解决方案。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解循环神经网络（RNN）的内部动态对于提高其可解释性和改进其设计至关重要。

Method: 通过量化节点间输入和输出向量的互信息，我们的方法可以确定网络运行期间信息流动的关键路径。我们将此方法应用于合成和真实世界的时间序列分类任务，采用各种RNN架构，包括LSTM和GRU。

Result: 我们的结果揭示了不同架构中信息中继的不同模式，从而深入了解了信息如何随时间进行处理和维护。此外，我们进行了节点淘汰实验，以评估已识别节点的功能重要性，通过阐明特定节点如何影响整体网络行为，从而为可解释的人工智能做出了重大贡献。

Conclusion: 这项研究不仅增强了我们对驱动RNN的复杂机制的理解，而且还为设计更强大和可解释的神经网络提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的正-无标签 (PU) 学习框架 NcPU，该框架在复杂数据集上显着优于现有方法，并且不需要辅助信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 PU 学习方法在复杂数据集上表现不佳，尤其是在没有辅助负样本或预估参数的情况下。主要瓶颈是在不可靠监督下学习区分性表示的挑战。

Method: NcPU 结合了噪声对鲁棒监督非对比损失 (NoiSNCL) 和幻影标签消歧 (PLD) 方案。NoiSNCL 对齐类内表示，而 PLD 通过基于后悔的标签更新提供保守的负监督。

Result: 实验表明，NoiSNCL 使简单的 PU 方法能够实现有竞争力的性能，并且 NcPU 在各种数据集上实现了比现有方法更好的性能。

Conclusion: NcPU 是一种很有前途的现实世界应用方法。

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的方法，通过模仿人类视觉中的微 saccades（微眼跳动），来探测大型语言模型（LLM）中的潜在问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到微眼跳动揭示人类感知中隐藏动态的启发，论文旨在为大型语言模型寻找类似的探测方法。

Method: 该方法通过轻量级的位置编码扰动来引出潜在信号，从而指示模型的错误行为。该方法不需要微调或特定任务的监督。

Result: 实验表明，基于扰动的探测方法可以有效地检测到包括事实性错误、安全性问题、毒性和后门攻击等多种设置下的失败案例，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，预训练的LLM已经编码了标记自身失败所需的内部证据，并且受微眼跳动启发的干预措施为检测和减轻不良行为提供了一条途径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ThinKV: Thought-adaptive KV cache compression for large reasoning models, reducing memory footprint while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models with long-output context generation require significant key-value (KV) cache, leading to GPU memory issues.

Method: Hybrid quantization-eviction strategy based on thought importance, with a kernel extending PagedAttention for efficient memory reuse.

Result: Near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% KV cache, up to 5.8x higher inference throughput.

Conclusion: ThinKV effectively compresses KV cache, improving performance and reducing memory usage for large reasoning models.

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Xiaobo Ma,Hyunsoo Noh,James Tokishi,Ryan Hatch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种领域自适应框架，用于解决传统机器学习模型在不同交叉口车辆延误估计中泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的车辆延误估计对于评估信号交叉口的性能和为交通管理策略提供信息至关重要。然而，传统模型通常假设训练和测试数据遵循相同的分布，这在实际应用中很少满足。

Method: 该框架将数据分为源域和目标域，提取关键交通特征，并使用来自目标域的小型标记子集微调模型。一种新的DA模型，即具有平衡加权的梯度提升（GBBW），根据与目标域的相似性对源数据进行重新加权，从而提高适应性。

Result: 使用亚利桑那州皮马县57个异构交叉口的数据对该框架进行了测试。结果表明，GBBW框架提供了更准确和稳健的延误估计。

Conclusion: 该方法支持更可靠的交通信号优化、拥堵管理和基于性能的规划。通过增强模型的可迁移性，该框架有助于在实际交通运输系统中更广泛地部署机器学习技术。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the
emerging research directions including multimodal integration and

structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify
opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable,

Result: 结果表明，关于输入权重的梯度近似为低秩，并且由两个秩一项控制：一个与 bulk 数据残差对齐，另一个与输入数据中的秩一对齐

Conclusion: 实验验证了我们的理论预测

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的固有维度估计（IDE）方法在不同数据集上的估计结果差异很大，需要在一个比现有基准更复杂的流形上进行基准测试。

Method: 设计了一个量子启发的固有维度估计（QuIIEst）基准，包含具有已知ID的拓扑非平凡流形的无限族。该基准基于一种量子光学方法，该方法嵌入任意均匀空间，同时允许曲率修改和加性噪声。

Result: 在相同的资源分配下，被测试的IDE方法在QuIIEst流形上的准确性普遍低于在现有基准上的准确性。随着曲率非均匀性的增加，性能下降很小，突出了基准的固有难度。

Conclusion: 对分形Hofstadter蝴蝶进行了IDE，并确定了哪些方法能够提取非流形空间的有效维度。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

Motivation: 现有的SSRL方法通常将预测器网络、停止梯度操作和统计正则化器等架构元素视为经验驱动的补充，而对其背后的基本原理缺乏足够的理解。

Method: 从变分互信息（MI）下界出发，推导出两种训练范式：自蒸馏互信息（SDMI）和联合互信息（JMI）。

Result: SDMI本质上需要交替优化，使得停止梯度操作在理论上必不可少。相比之下，JMI允许通过对称架构进行联合优化，而无需此类组件。在所提出的公式下，SDMI中的预测器网络和JMI中的统计正则化器成为MI目标的可处理替代。

Conclusion: 本文为现有SSRL方法的不同架构组件的选择提供了理论解释，超越了启发式便利。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中的对称感知方法（如数据增强和等变架构）旨在提高泛化性和样本效率，但前提是转换后的数据点在测试分布下是高概率的。本文旨在评估这一假设。

Method: 本文提出了一种指标，通过双样本神经分类器测试来区分原始数据集及其随机增强的等效数据集，从而量化数据集中的各向异性或对称性破缺。

Result: 本文在合成数据集上验证了该指标，并发现几个基准点云数据集中存在出乎意料的高度对齐。理论上表明，分布对称性破缺会阻止不变方法达到最佳性能，即使在无限特征限制下不变岭回归也是如此。实证上发现，对称感知方法的影响取决于数据集。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，理解等变性（无论何时起作用以及为什么）可能需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏差。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

Method: 论文引入选择性欠拟合的概念，即扩散模型在某些区域更准确地逼近得分，而在其他区域则欠拟合。

Result: 论文对这些区域进行了表征，并设计了经验干预来验证这一观点。

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合对于理解扩散模型至关重要，为它们的泛化和生成性能提供了新的、可测试的见解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

### [178] [Fine-Tuning Masked Diffusion for Provable Self-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01384)
*Jaeyeon Kim,Seunggeun Kim,Taekyun Lee,David Z. Pan,Hyeji Kim,Sham Kakade,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PRISM，一个轻量级的、模型无关的方法，用于改进Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) 的自校正能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MDM自校正方法需要改进MDM架构/训练，或者依赖于不精确的token质量代理，限制了其应用。

Method: PRISM定义了一个自校正损失，可以学习每个token的质量分数，无需RL或验证器。这些质量分数与MDM在同一个前向传播中计算，并用于检测低质量的token。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上改进了MDM推理：Sudoku、无条件文本 (170M) 和带有 LLaDA (8B) 的代码。

Conclusion: PRISM是一种有效的MDM自校正方法，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

*Yusuf Kalayci,Vinod Raman,Shaddin Dughmi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于潘多拉魔盒问题的推理时优化框架，用于平衡LLM生成质量和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的生成通常需要在输出质量和推理成本之间进行权衡，尤其是在使用多次生成时。

Method: 开发了UCB风格的潘多拉魔盒算法，并进一步通过受Bradley-Terry启发的变换来解决跨提示的奖励缩放问题，将其适应于实际的LLM设置。

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上进行的实验表明，我们的自适应策略可以获得与非自适应Best-of-N采样相同的性能，同时平均减少15-35%的生成次数。

Conclusion: 我们的结果在最优停止理论和推理时缩放之间建立了一个有原则的桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能界限和实际效率增益。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的神经网络代理框架，用于学习集体变量（CVs）并提供Jacobians，以解决传统自由能重建方法中计算Jacobians的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自由能重建方法如高斯过程回归（GPR）需要集体变量（CVs）的Jacobians，这限制了复杂或机器学习的CVs的使用。

Method: 该方法通过神经网络直接从笛卡尔坐标学习CVs，并使用自动微分来提供Jacobians，从而绕过解析形式。

Result: 在MgCl2离子配对系统中，该方法在简单距离CV和复杂配位数CV上均实现了高精度。此外，Jacobian误差也服从近高斯分布，使其适用于GPR流程。

Conclusion: 该框架使得基于梯度的自由能方法能够整合复杂和机器学习的CVs，拓宽了生物化学和材料模拟的范围。

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于低秩表示的压缩重建框架有效地解决了神经压缩中的解码器瓶颈问题，同时保持了图像质量。

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

*Dorsa Soleymani,Ali Dadsetan,Frank Rudzicz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SoftAdaClip，一种新的差分隐私训练方法，使用平滑转换代替硬裁剪，以保持相对梯度幅度并限制敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私(DP)通常会降低模型性能和公平性，特别是在代表性不足的群体中。梯度裁剪会不成比例地抑制少数子群体的学习信号。自适应裁剪仍然依赖于统一的硬裁剪，这可能会限制公平性。

Method: 用一个平滑的、基于tanh的转换代替硬裁剪，以保持相对梯度的大小，同时限制敏感性。

Result: 在各种数据集上的评估表明，与DP-SGD相比，SoftAdaClip减少了高达87%的子群体差异，与Adaptive-DPSGD相比，减少了高达48%，并且这些子群体差异的减少具有统计学意义。

Conclusion: 将平滑转换与自适应机制相结合，对于实现公平和私有的模型训练至关重要。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的注意力机制，称为局部线性注意力（LLA），它通过测试时回归从非参数统计中导出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索更具表现力的注意力机制，即使计算成本更高，以弥补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出 LLA，并通过偏差-方差权衡分析证明其在联想记忆方面优于线性注意力和 Softmax 注意力。此外，还提出了两种节省内存的原语来解决计算复杂性问题，并引入了 FlashLLA 算法，该算法可在现代加速器上实现可扩展和并行计算。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLA 能有效适应非平稳性，在测试时训练和上下文学习方面优于强大的基线，并为 LLA 在大型模型中的可扩展性和适用性提供了有希望的证据。

Conclusion: LLA 是一种很有前途的注意力机制，它在各种任务中都表现出色，并且具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 SCOPED 的快速通用 OOD 检测方法，该方法只需单次前向传播和一次 Jacobian-vector 乘积，即可实现高效的 OOD 检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉、机器人、强化学习等领域，可靠部署机器学习系统，离群分布 (OOD) 检测至关重要。

Method: 该方法结合了 Jacobian 迹和模型评分函数的平方范数，形成单一的测试统计量。使用核密度估计来估计 SCOPED 分数的同分布密度。

Result: 在四个视觉基准测试中，SCOPED 实现了有竞争力的或最先进的精度-召回率分数，并且推广到具有共享状态和动作空间的机器人控制任务。

Conclusion: SCOPED 是在真实世界领域中实现快速可靠的 OOD 检测的实用基础。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MBPO在OpenAI Gym中表现出强大的样本效率，但在DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)中却不如Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)。本文旨在研究MBPO在DMC中失败的原因。

Method: 本文通过识别动态模型和奖励模型之间的尺度不匹配以及目标表示选择不当这两个问题，来分析MBPO在DMC中表现不佳的原因。

Result: 通过解决这些问题，MBPO在七个任务中的五个中超过了SAC，同时保持了在OpenAI Gym中报告的强大性能。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果旨在促使研究人员开发将MDP任务和环境结构与算法失败模式联系起来的分类方法，并寻求统一的解决方案，明确基准选择如何最终影响算法泛化的条件。

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

Conclusion: 对噪声偏好学习的分析适用于广泛的偏好优化损失，并在当代大型语言模型上进行了实证验证，证实了研究结果的实际意义。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习利用离线数据集进行预训练和在线交互进行微调，但其经验行为非常不一致。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个有原则的框架，用于指导基于离线数据集和预训练策略的相对性能的离线到在线 RL 中的设计选择。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的基于LLM的贝叶斯优化方法，并在实验中验证了其在高维黑盒优化问题中的有效性。

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned, architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with reduced search cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supernet-based HW-NAS methods are computationally expensive, while LLM-driven approaches suffer from exploration bias, failing to discover diverse architectures across the entire search space.

Method: PEL-NAS consists of three key components: 1) a complexity-driven partitioning engine; 2) an LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator; 3) a zero-cost predictor.

Result: PEL-NAS achieves higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at similar accuracy on HW-NAS-Bench. The search cost drops from days to minutes compared with traditional supernet baselines.

Conclusion: PEL-NAS effectively addresses the exploration bias in LLM-driven HW-NAS, significantly reducing search cost while maintaining high accuracy and low latency.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from

overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at

compared with traditional supernet baselines.

*Shriram Karpoora Sundara Pandian,Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒的离线强化学习方法，通过对干净数据赋予更高权重来减轻受污染数据的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离线强化学习方法在面对受污染的数据集时，性能会下降。

Method: 引入密度比加权行为克隆（Weighted BC），使用少量干净的参考集来估计轨迹级别的密度比，并将其作为BC目标中的权重。

Result: Weighted BC在各种污染比例下都能保持接近最优的性能，优于传统BC、BCQ和BRAC等基线方法。

Conclusion: Weighted BC 是一种有效的模仿学习方法，对受污染的数据具有鲁棒性，且具有理论保证。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

*Isha Gupta,Rylan Schaeffer,Joshua Kazdan,Ken Liu,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对抗鲁棒性领域早已确定对抗样本可以在图像分类器之间成功转移，文本越狱也可以在语言模型 (LM) 之间成功转移。然而，最近的两项研究报告说，无法在视觉语言模型 (VLM) 之间成功转移图像越狱。为了解释这种显着差异，我们提出了关于机器学习模型攻击可转移性的一个根本区别：输入数据空间中的攻击可以转移，而模型表示空间中的攻击则不能，至少在没有表示的几何对齐的情况下不能。然后，我们提供了在四种不同设置中对该假设的理论和经验证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么图像越狱在视觉语言模型 (VLM) 之间不能成功转移，而对抗样本和文本越狱可以分别在图像分类器和语言模型之间转移。

Method: 1. 在一个简单的环境中，通过不同的表示计算相同的输入输出映射，从而在数学上证明了这种区别。2. 我们构建了针对图像分类器的表示空间攻击，这些攻击与众所周知的数据空间攻击一样成功，但无法转移。3. 我们构建了针对 LM 的表示空间攻击，这些攻击成功地越狱了受攻击的模型，但再次无法转移。4. 我们构建了针对 VLM 的数据空间攻击，这些攻击成功转移到新的 VLM，并且我们表明，当 VLM 的潜在几何结构在后投影空间中充分对齐时，表示空间攻击*可以*转移。

Result: 对抗转移并非所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作领域 - 共享数据空间与模型独特的表示空间 - 这是构建更强大的模型的关键见解。

Conclusion: 对抗转移取决于攻击的操作域：共享数据空间与模型独特的表示空间。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的聚合算法（OW 和 ISP），以更有效地整合来自多个 LLM 的答案，优于简单的多数投票方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的多数投票方法在整合多个 LLM 的答案时，忽略了模型之间的潜在异质性和相关性，导致效果不佳。

Method: 设计了 Optimal Weight (OW) 和 Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP) 两种新的聚合算法，利用了一阶和二阶信息。

Result: 在合成数据集、LLM 微调基准测试（如 UltraFeedback 和 MMLU）以及实际医疗保健环境 ARMMAN 中，所提出的方法始终优于多数投票方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在实践中表现更好，并为设计稳健的多智能体 LLM 管道提供了概念性见解。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

TL;DR: 本研究针对强化学习在临床决策支持系统（CDSS）中应用时，医生对不合理剂量决策的质疑，提出了一种端到端的方法，用于学习脓毒性休克 ICU 患者双血管加压药给药的最佳药物剂量和控制策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在临床决策支持系统中应用时，医生对不合理剂量决策的质疑。

Method: 结合离线保守 Q 学习和新型循环建模，在回放缓冲区中捕获 ICU 时间序列数据中的时间依赖性；采用动作空间设计，适应离散、连续和定向给药策略。

Result: 设计的动作空间提高了可解释性，促进了临床应用，同时保持了疗效；在 eICU 和 MIMIC 数据集上，患者生存改善概率提高了 15% 以上，同时符合既定的临床协议。

Conclusion: 动作空间设计深刻影响学习到的行为策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识图谱基础模型在处理零样本链接预测任务时，由于确定性等变的限制，无法区分结构相似但语义不同的关系。

Method: 本文提出了一种概率节点关系等变方法，并在此基础上构建了一个名为Flock的知识图谱基础模型。Flock通过迭代采样随机游走、使用记录协议将其编码为序列、使用序列模型嵌入它们，并通过学习池化聚合节点和关系的表示。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Flock模型通过概率节点关系等变性，提高了知识图谱基础模型在零样本链接预测任务中的表达能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在食品生产动物中安全使用药物对于保护动物福利和人类食品安全至关重要。不良事件可能预示着意想不到的药代动力学或毒代动力学效应，增加食物链中违规残留的风险。

Conclusion: 该框架表明，结合严谨的数据工程、先进的机器学习和可解释的AI，可以对兽医安全结果进行准确、可解释的预测，从而加强残留风险评估，并为监管和临床决策提供信息。

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

TL;DR: CarbonX is an open-source tool using Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for decarbonization tasks, providing carbon intensity forecasts and imputation across diverse grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing carbon intensity forecasting tools have limitations like requiring grid-specific data, lacking global coverage, and not providing uncertainty estimates.

Method: CarbonX leverages TSFMs, using historical carbon intensity data and a single general model for forecasting and imputation.

Result: CarbonX achieves a zero-shot forecasting MAPE of 15.82% across 214 grids, comparable performance to state-of-the-art on 13 benchmark grids (9.59% average MAPE), and outperforms statistical baselines by 1.2-3.9X on imputation. It provides forecasts up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: CarbonX is a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization, easily usable on any grid with limited data while delivering strong performance.

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种改进整数规划 (IP) 公式的方法，以解决二值神经网络 (BNN) 的验证问题，即确定输入中的小扰动是否会导致 BNN 错误分类。这些技术旨在缩小由 big-M 约束引起的大整数间隙，从而实现对 BNN 更高范围的输入扰动的验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证二值神经网络 (BNN) 在分类任务中的鲁棒性，通过解决验证问题来衡量，即确定输入中的小扰动是否会导致 BNN 错误分类。传统的整数规划 (IP) 公式由于 big-M 约束引起的大整数间隙，难以有效解决 BNN 验证问题。

Method: 1. 提出了一种新的线性目标函数获取方法，用于多类别分类设置。
2. 引入了一种生成有效不等式的新技术，利用 BNN 的递归结构来改进 IP 公式。

Result: 提出的技术能够在有限的时间内，验证 BNN 对比现有 IP 方法更高范围的输入扰动。

Conclusion: 通过改进整数规划公式，本文提出的技术能够更有效地验证二值神经网络的鲁棒性，抵抗更大范围的输入扰动。

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

Conclusion: 这项工作表明，往返一致性不仅是一种理想的属性，而且是一个可训练的目标，为更强大和可靠的基础模型提供了一条新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.
