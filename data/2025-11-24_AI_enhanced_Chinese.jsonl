Currently, almost all algorithms follow an $\u03b5$-Recall-Bounded principle when comparing performance: they require the ANN search results to achieve a recall of more than $1-\u03b5$ and then compare query-per-second (QPS) performance. However, this approach only accounts for the recall of true positive results and does not provide guarantees on the deviation of incorrect results. To address this limitation, we focus on an Error-Bounded ANN method, which ensures that the returned results are a $(1/\u03b4)$-approximation of the true values. Our approach adopts a graph-based framework. To enable Error-Bounded ANN search, we propose a $\u03b4$-EMG (Error-bounded Monotonic Graph), which, for the first time, provides a provable approximation for arbitrary queries. By enforcing a $\u03b4$-monotonic geometric constraint during graph construction, $\u03b4$-EMG ensures that any greedy search converges to a $(1/\u03b4)$-approximate neighbor without backtracking. Building on this foundation, we design an error-bounded top-$k$ ANN search algorithm that adaptively controls approximation accuracy during query time. To make the framework practical at scale, we introduce $\u03b4$-EMQG (Error-bounded Monotonic Quantized Graph), a localized and degree-balanced variant with near-linear construction complexity. We further integrate vector quantization to accelerate distance computation while preserving theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments on the ANN-Benchmarks dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Under a recall requirement of 0.99, our algorithm achieves 19,000 QPS on the SIFT1M dataset, outperforming other methods by more than 40\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\uff08ANN\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ANN\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u03b4-EMG\u548c\u03b4-EMQG\u4e24\u79cd\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728ANN-Benchmarks\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0cQPS\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance.

Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate.

However, current PRAG approaches adopt a \\textbf{one-to-one} document encoding scheme, using a dedicated LoRA adapter for each individual document. This scheme introduces two major limitations: First, it leads to data scarcity, as the training datasets for individual LoRA adapters are limited. Second, it incurs high overhead during inference, requiring the merging of LLM weights with a new LoRA adapter for every candidate passage, which is computationally inefficient. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel paradigm for encoding passages in PRAG that utilizes a latent routing encoding process (Poly-PRAG). During offline encoding, we treat the encoding of a set of documents as a multi-task learning process, where each passage is assigned a unique task identifier. By employing a routing function, we use a small set of latent LoRA adapters to encode the entire passage space. During online inference, this routing function selectively activates a subset of latent experts based on the input query.

However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u641c\u7d22\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLM)\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u53cd\u9988\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u53cd\u9988(PRF)\u3001\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u53cd\u9988(GRF)\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u6458\u8981(AFS)\u3002", "result": "\u5728Flickr30k\u548cCOCO\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGRF\u3001AFS\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u4f7f\u8f83\u5c0fVLM\u7684MRR@5\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863-5%\uff0c\u800c\u8f83\u5927\u7684VLM\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861-3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u5f3aVLM\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u5f00\u8f9f\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.\n  To address this, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.\n  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \\textbf{5.7$\\times$} retrieval speedup and \\textbf{1.8$\\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \\textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems.

Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.\n  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and diverse forecasting architectures demonstrate that DDTime consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, achieving about 30% relative accuracy gains while introducing about 2.49% computational overhead.

In this study, we focus on macaque monkeys, widely studied in systems neuroscience and evolutionary research, and propose a method to generate their facial expressions using a style-based generative image model (i.e., StyleGAN2). To address data limitations, we implemented: 1) data augmentation by synthesizing new facial expression images using a motion transfer to animate still images with computer graphics, 2) sample selection based on the latent representation of macaque faces from an initially trained StyleGAN2 model to ensure the variation and uniform sampling in training dataset, and 3) loss function refinement to ensure the accurate reproduction of subtle movements, such as eye movements.

While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices.

While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels.

Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server).

We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines.

Isolation levels offer a configurable mechanism to manage the interaction between concurrent transactions, enabling varying degrees of consistency and performance trade-offs. These isolation guarantees are supported by all major RDBMSs. However, testing transaction behavior under different isolation levels remains a significant challenge due to two primary reasons. First, automatically generating test transactions that can effectively expose bugs in transaction handling logic is non-trivial, as such bugs are typically triggered under specific transactional constraints. Second, detecting logic anomalies in transaction outcomes is difficult because the correct execution results are often unknown for randomly generated transactions. To address these challenges, we propose an anomaly pattern-guided testing approach for uncovering transaction bugs in RDBMSs. Our solution tackles the first challenge by introducing a test case generation technique guided by predefined anomaly patterns, which increases the likelihood of exposing transactional bugs. For the second challenge, we present a two-phase detection process, involving explicit error detection and implicit error detection, to identify bugs in transaction execution. We have implemented our approach in a tool, APTrans, and evaluated it on three widely-used RDBMSs: MySQL, MariaDB, and OceanBase.

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains.

This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels.

While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments.

This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability.

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6GCL-OT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u79cd\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ed3\u6784-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u786c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eRealSoftMax\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6765\u5f3a\u8c03\u5173\u952e\u7684\u90bb\u5c45-\u8bcd\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eprompt\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u6392\u9664\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86OT\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8f6f\u76d1\u7763\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGCL-OT\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GCL-OT\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7ed3\u6784-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u754c\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF 97) \u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u9ad8\u65af-\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u53bb\u9664\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u60ef\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u805a\u53d8 (ICF) \u7684\u4e2d\u5b50\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u964d\u566a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u5b50\u6210\u50cf\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u60ef\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u805a\u53d8 (ICF) \u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u56fe\u50cf\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53bb\u9664\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528 Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF 97) \u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b50\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u964d\u566a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u975e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5b50\u56fe\u50cf\u964d\u566a\u548c ICF \u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples.

Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs.

While model fine-tuning is often employed to ensure safe responses, this technique is static and does not lend itself to everyday situations involving dynamic values and preferences. In this paper, we present a practical, reproducible, and model-agnostic procedure to evaluate whether a prompt candidate can effectively steer generated text toward specific human values, formalising a scoring method to quantify the presence and gain of target values in generated responses. We apply our method to a variant of the Wizard-Vicuna language model, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and a structured evaluation through a dialogue dataset. With this setup, we compare a baseline prompt to one explicitly conditioned on values, and show that value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u793a\u5019\u9009\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7b26\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u4e14\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u548c\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u662f\u9759\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6d89\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u548c\u504f\u597d\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Schwartz\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eWizard-Vicuna\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\u3002\u5c06\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u660e\u786e\u4ee5\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e5f\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5f15\u5bfc\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u3002"}}

However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MirrorMind\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u53cc\u91cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u5f81\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u73af\u5883\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5c06\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u4ea7\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u96be\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "method": "MirrorMind\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4e09\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e2a\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u5c42\u5c06\u96c6\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5b66\u79d1\u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\uff0c\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5c42\u5145\u5f53\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u7f16\u6392\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e2a\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u96c6\u4f53\u5b66\u79d1\u5e7f\u5ea6\uff0cMirrorMind\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u4ea7\u751f\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "MirrorMind\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e2a\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u96c6\u4f53\u5b66\u79d1\u5e7f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u4ea7\u751f\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u73af\u5883\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation.

Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u68af\u5ea6\uff08CG\uff09\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u6982\u5ff5\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u63a2\u7d22\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "1. \u5229\u7528\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6deb\u79fd\u3001\u5a01\u80c1\u3001\u4fae\u8fb1\u7b49\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\n2. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u68af\u5ea6\uff08CG\uff09\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8861\u91cf\u6982\u5ff5\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n3. \u63d0\u51faTargeted Lexicon Set\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5bfc\u81f4\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u8bcd\u8bed\u3002\n4. \u8ba1\u7b97Word-Concept Alignment (WCA)\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bcd\u8bed\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6bd2\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\n5. \u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u8bcd\u6c47\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6392\u9664\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6bd2\u6027\u8bcd\u6c47\u96c6\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Targeted Lexicon Set\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97WCA\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bcd\u6c47\u96c6\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u8bcd\u6c47\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6280\u672f\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u51cf\u8f7b\u7531\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

For these agents, scaling involves not only \"thinking\" in tokens but also \"acting\" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack \"budget awareness\" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to \"dig deeper\" on a promising lead or \"pivot\" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u589e\u52a0\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u9884\u7b97\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9884\u7b97\u610f\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u662fWeb\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9884\u7b97\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\uff08Budget Tracker\uff09\u548c\u9884\u7b97\u611f\u77e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u6846\u67b6\uff08BATS\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5176\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u7b97\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u6210\u672c-\u6027\u80fd\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u548c\u6709\u539f\u5219\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, our objective is to illuminate the performance nuances of these FL methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60 (FL) \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5206\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7269\u8054\u7f51 (IoT) \u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u662f\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03 (non-IID) \u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0cFL \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5 (FedAvg, FedProx, Scaffold) \u5728\u68c0\u6d4b IoT \u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51 (IoT) \u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60 (FL) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u8865\u6551\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03 (non-IID) \u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd FL \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b IoT \u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5 FedAvg\u3001FedProx \u548c Scaffold\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528 CICIoT2023 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21 IoT \u653b\u51fb\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u9610\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b FL \u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5168\u9762\u4e86\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u6784\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, for single object SVGs, generating multi-view consistent SVGs from a single-view input remains underexplored. We present a three stage framework that produces multi-view SVGs with geometric and color consistency from a single SVG input. First, the rasterized input is lifted to a 3D representation and rendered under target camera poses, producing multi-view images of the object. Next, we extend the temporal memory mechanism of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) to the spatial domain, constructing a spatial memory bank that establishes part level correspondences across neighboring views, yielding cleaner and more consistent vector paths and color assignments without retraining. Finally, during the raster to vector conversion, we perform path consolidation and structural optimization to reduce redundancy while preserving boundaries and semantics. The resulting SVGs exhibit strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduce redundant paths, and retain fine structural details.

However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3.

To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \\textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice.

Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a Mesh RAG \u7684\u65b0\u578b\u3001\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u6765\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u683c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u7f51\u683c\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u521b\u5efa\uff0c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u827a\u672f\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u8303\u4f8b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6027\u8d28\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8d28\u91cf-\u901f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u987a\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4e5f\u663e\u7740\u5730\u4f7f\u589e\u91cf\u7f16\u8f91\u590d\u6742\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u5230\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b RAG \u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u6765\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u683c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u4ece\u5176\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86 Mesh RAG \u5728\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u7740\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f51\u683c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u52a0\u5feb\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u91cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "Mesh RAG \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f51\u683c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u52a0\u5feb\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u91cf\u7f16\u8f91\u3002"}}

Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones.

To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data.

This work represents a step towards accessible, generative world-building at scale, advancing the frontier of 3D generative AI for applications in gaming, simulation, and immersive social environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "WorldGen: \u751f\u6210\u5927\u578b\u4e92\u52a83D\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f25\u5408\u521b\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u865a\u62df\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u6216\u4e13\u4e1a\u76843D\u77e5\u8bc6\u5373\u53ef\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u53ef\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5e03\u5c40\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u76843D\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u671d\u7740\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e16\u754c\u6784\u5efa\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e863D\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u524d\u6cbf\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u793e\u4ea4\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\\%, revealing a 4.21$\\times$ structural imprinting effect. These findings indicate that multilingual LLMs distinguish languages not by surface script features but by latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus.

The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers.

Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods.

While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u4e00\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\uff08CP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5e8f\u6570CP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6216\u9650\u5236\u6027\u5730\u8981\u6c42\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5e8f\u6570\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0a\u7684\u5355\u5cf0\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u8986\u76d6\u7387-\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4fCP\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9752\u7750\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e00\u81f4\u5e8f\u6570\u5206\u7c7b\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u957f\u5ea6\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u90fd\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u5019\u9009\u8005\u7684\u6570\u91cfK\u4e2d\u53ea\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff08\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e15%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5e8f\u6570CP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

In this work, we present BOP-ASK, a novel large scale dataset for object interaction reasoning for both training and benchmarking. Our data generation pipeline leverages 6D object poses from the Benchmark for Object Pose Estimation (BOP) datasets from which we derive fine grained annotations such as grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, relative spatial and depth relationships, and object-to-object relationships. BOP-ASK comprises over 150k images and 33M question answer pairs spanning six tasks (four novel), providing a rich resource for training and evaluating VLMs. We evaluate proprietary and open sourced VLMs, and conduct human evaluations on BOP-ASK-core, a contributed test benchmark. We also release BOP-ASK-lab, an out-of-distribution benchmark with images not sourced from BOP, enabling testing of generalization.

Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks.

The use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has driven major advances in this recognition task. In real-world scenarios, the captured skeletons are not always perfect or complete because of occlusions of parts of the human body or poor communication quality, leading to missing parts in skeletons or videos with missing frames. In the presence of such non-idealities, existing GCN models perform poorly due to missing local context. To address this limitation, we propose Parts-Mamba, a hybrid GCN-Mamba model designed to enhance the ability to capture and maintain contextual information from distant joints.

To address this question in the auditory domain, we quantified the alignment between the internal representations of 36 different audio models and brain activity from two independent fMRI datasets. Using voxel-wise and component-wise regression, and representation similarity analysis (RSA), we found that recent self-supervised audio models with strong performance in diverse downstream tasks are better predictors of auditory cortex activity than older and more specialized models. To assess the quality of the audio representations, we evaluated these models in 6 auditory tasks from the HEAREval benchmark, spanning music, speech, and environmental sounds. This revealed strong positive Pearson correlations ($r>0.7$) between a model's overall task performance and its alignment with brain representations. Finally, we analyzed the evolution of the similarity between audio and brain representations during the pretraining of EnCodecMAE. We discovered that brain similarity increases progressively and emerges early during pretraining, despite the model not being explicitly optimized for this objective. This suggests that brain-like representations can be an emergent byproduct of learning to reconstruct missing information from naturalistic audio data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ANNs\uff09\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u662f\u5426\u4f7f\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5927\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u542c\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u531636\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u6765\u81ea\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acbfMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5927\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd1\u671f\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u65e9\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u542c\u89c9\u76ae\u5c42\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728HEAREval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5176\u4e0e\u5927\u8111\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u5b9a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ANN\uff09\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u4f1a\u4f7f\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u66f4\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5927\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f53\u7d20\u548c\u6210\u5206\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08RSA\uff09\uff0c\u91cf\u531636\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u6765\u81ea\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acbfMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5927\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u8fd1\u671f\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u66f4\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u542c\u89c9\u76ae\u5c42\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5176\u4e0e\u5927\u8111\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08r>0.7\uff09\u3002\u5927\u8111\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7c7b\u8111\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u97f3\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u5efa\u7f3a\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u610f\u5916\u526f\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective and extend the original framework of GW to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. Our formulation provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of mm-spaces, with point sampling convergence. We also show that the objective can be formulated and solved for point cloud object representations by adapting traditional algorithms in Optimal Transport, including entropic regularization. Our benchmarking with other variants of GW for partial matching indicates superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency of our method, while experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show its effectiveness for multiple shape matching, including geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes, suggesting promising applications for solving complex matching problems across diverse domains, including computer graphics and structural biology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) \u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86 GW \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u5339\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) \u8ddd\u79bb\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u591a\u5bf9\u4e00\u6216\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u5339\u914d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) \u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff09\u6765\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u5339\u914d\u7684 GW \u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u590d\u5408\u7269\uff09\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 JGW \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u884c\u4e3a\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6216\u975e\u7b56\u7565LLM\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u63a2\u9488\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u548c\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u516b\u79cd\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u884c\u4e3a\u63a2\u9488\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a2\u9488\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ece\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u6fc0\u52b1\u4ea7\u751f\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u6210\u529f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u6570\u636e\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406LLM\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\\%$ and $92.11\\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies. Overall, this study confirms the efficiency of DNNs and emphasizes their potential to provide greater accuracy and reliability for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases using voice-based biomarkers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DNN\uff09\u5728\u533a\u5206\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\uff08PD\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\u8005\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ML\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5(PD)\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u635f\u5bb3\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6d3b\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5e38\u4f34\u6709\u58f0\u97f3\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5982\u53d1\u58f0\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6784\u97f3\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u58f0\u97f3\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u6765\u652f\u6301PD\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7684\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86Mel\u9891\u7387\u5012\u8c31\u7cfb\u6570(MFCCs)\u3002\u4f7f\u75281000\u6b21\u72ec\u7acb\u968f\u673a\u6267\u884c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u6b63\u6001\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u68c0\u9a8c(Kruskal-Wallis\u548cBonferroni\u4e8b\u540e\u68c0\u9a8c)\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5728PD\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "result": "DNN\u5728\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a98.65%\u548c92.11%\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684ML\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDNN\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86dnn\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aREPA\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6216flow-based\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5982DINOv2\uff09\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6216flow-based\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f3a\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08REPA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86REPA\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0eDINOv2\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6563\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caREPA\u66f4\u65b0\u5982\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u5411\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u9760\u62e2\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001box inpainting\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth.

These characteristics make glass surface detection a challenging computer vision task. Existing glass surface detection methods always rely on boundary cues (e.g., window and door frames) or reflection cues to locate glass surfaces, but they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of the glass itself for accurate localization. We observed that in most real-world scenes, the illumination intensity in front of the glass surface differs from that behind it, which results in variations in the reflections visible on the glass surface. Specifically, when standing on the brighter side of the glass and applying a flash towards the darker side, existing reflections on the glass surface tend to disappear. Conversely, while standing on the darker side and applying a flash towards the brighter side, distinct reflections will appear on the glass surface. Based on this phenomenon, we propose NFGlassNet, a novel method for glass surface detection that leverages the reflection dynamics present in flash/no-flash imagery. Specifically, we propose a Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections, and a Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for fusing features from reflection and glass surface for accurate glass surface detection. For learning our network, we also construct a dataset consisting of 3.3K no-flash and flash image pairs captured from various scenes with corresponding ground truth annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness.

Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency.

However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models.

While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly. Our divide-and-conquer strategy exploits the spectral dependency in images, simplifying score model estimation by disentangling the denoising and deblurring processes.

The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints.

Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images.

For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset.

Our goal is to achieve unification along three axes: the model, the tasks, and the representations. At the representation level, we eliminate modality discrepancies by mapping both text and images into a shared visual space: textual prompts are rendered as painted text images on a clean canvas, and all inputs and outputs are treated purely as RGB pixels. This yields a fully vision-native formulation of multimodal learning. At the task level, a broad range of vision-language problems are cast as pixel-to-pixel transformations in this visual space. For understanding tasks, the model takes an RGB image and produces a painted text image that visually encodes the semantic prediction. For generation tasks, painted text images serve as visual conditions that guide realistic and semantically aligned image synthesis. Captioning and text-to-image generation thus become different directions of the same underlying visual translation process. At the model level, we instantiate a single Unified Diffusion Transformer trained with rectified flow in pixel space. A shared backbone jointly learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images, with lightweight task embeddings to specify the desired direction. Experiments on text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability such as cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops.

With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments show that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models and generate summaries representing argument structures that are more helpful to users, of high textual quality and quantification accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bba\u70b9\u611f\u77e5\u5b9a\u91cf\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8bba\u70b9\u7684claim-reason\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u6570\u91cf\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u8bba\u70b9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u53e5\u5b50\u4e2d\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ARQUSUMM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528LLM\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u53e5\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u547d\u9898\u53ca\u5176claim-reason\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8bba\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u805a\u5408\u8bba\u70b9\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cARQUSUMM\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u6458\u8981\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u8868\u8bba\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6458\u8981\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ARQUSUMM\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u5728\u7ebf\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6458\u8981\u3002"}}

Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, making morphology analysis challenging. We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life.

However, they suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and a trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity, primarily caused by inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames. In this paper, within the DM-based VSR pipeline, we revisit the role of alignment and compensation between adjacent video frames and reveal two crucial observations: (a) the feature domain is better suited than the pixel domain for information compensation due to its stronger spatial and temporal correlations, and (b) warping at an upscaled resolution better preserves high-frequency information, but this benefit is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, we propose a novel Densely Guided diffusion model with Aligned Features for Video Super-Resolution (DGAF-VSR), with an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in the aligned features and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) to deliver dense guidance in the feature domain. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DGAF-VSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in key aspects of VSR, including perceptual quality (35.82\\% DISTS reduction), fidelity (0.20 dB PSNR gain), and temporal consistency (30.37\\% tLPIPS reduction).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08VSR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540d\u4e3aDGAF-VSR\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f2a\u5f71\u4ee5\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684VSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u4e4b\u95f4\u8865\u507f\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f2a\u5f71\u4ee5\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08DGAF-VSR\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u5149\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u626d\u66f2\u6a21\u5757\uff08OGWM\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u4e2d\u4f20\u9012\u5bc6\u96c6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u5757\uff08FTCM\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDGAF-VSR\u5728VSR\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff08DISTS\u964d\u4f4e35.82%\uff09\uff0c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08PSNR\u589e\u76ca0.20 dB\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08tLPIPS\u964d\u4f4e30.37%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "DGAF-VSR\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning.

Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\\%, and up to 9\\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions. Overall, ToC establishes a transparent, controllable, and interpretable methodology that effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning capabilities with strategic MCTS planning for structured patent claim optimization.The source code is available at https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tree of Claims (ToC)\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4e13\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6LLM\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u4e13\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u64b0\u5199\u52b3\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5927\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u6539\u8fdb\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Tree of Claims (ToC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u7f16\u8f91\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22 (MCTS) \u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b1145\u9879\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cToC\u5728zero-shot\u548cfew-shot\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6LLM\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e868%\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u8fbe9%\u3002", "conclusion": "ToC\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6218\u7565\u6027MCTS\u89c4\u5212\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. In contrast, high-level semantic alignment between message and object presence emerges as the strongest predictor of human judgment.

Despite their practical success, theoretically understanding the gradient descent dynamics for training DEQs remains an area of active research. In this work, we rigorously study the gradient descent dynamics for DEQs in the simple setting of linear models and single-index models, filling several gaps in the literature. We prove a conservation law for linear DEQs which implies that the parameters remain trapped on spheres during training and use this property to show that gradient flow remains well-conditioned for all time. We then prove linear convergence of gradient descent to a global minimizer for linear DEQs and deep equilibrium single-index models under appropriate initialization and with a sufficiently small step size.

To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries.

We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation.

Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset.

Shroff"], "title": "FIRM: Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective Alignment for Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values often involves balancing multiple, conflicting objectives such as helpfulness and harmlessness. Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency.

To address this critical gap, we propose \\textbf{MultiPriv}, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the \\textbf{Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR)} framework and construct a novel, bilingual multimodal dataset to support it. The dataset uniquely features a core component of synthetic individual profiles where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are meticulously linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum, from attribute detection to cross-image re-identification and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 foundational and commercial VLMs. Our analysis reveals: (1) Many VLMs possess significant, unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks.

Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering.

Conventional motion-compensated reconstructions typically rely on pre-estimated optical flow, which is inaccurate under undersampling and degrades reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a novel implicit neural representation (INR) framework that jointly models both the dynamic image sequence and its underlying motion field. Specifically, one INR is employed to parameterize the spatiotemporal image content, while another INR represents the optical flow. The two are coupled via the optical flow equation, which serves as a physics-inspired regularization, in addition to a data consistency loss that enforces agreement with k-space measurements.

While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eKaplan scaling laws\u7684GPU\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u53bb\u566a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540cGPU\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u80fd\u91cf\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08R-squared > 0.9\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eedAI\u90e8\u7f72\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u4f30\u7b97\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose Fine-grained Finger-level Hand Motion Captioning (FingerCap), which aims to generate textual descriptions that capture detailed finger-level semantics of hand actions. To support this task, we curate FingerCap-40K, a large-scale corpus of 40K paired hand-motion videos and captions spanning two complementary sources: concise instruction-style finger motions and diverse, naturalistic hand-object interactions. To enable effective evaluation, we employ HandJudge, a LLM-based rubric that measures finger-level correctness and motion completeness. Temporal sparsity remains a fundamental bottleneck for current Video-MLLMs, since sparse RGB sampling is insufficient to capture the subtle, high-frequency dynamics underlying fine finger motions. As a simple and compute-friendly remedy, we introduce FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures), which pairs each RGB keyframe with subsequent hand keypoints until the next keyframe. A lightweight temporal encoder converts the keypoints into motion embeddings and integrates them with RGB features. FiGOP adapts the classic GOP concept to finger motion, recovering fine temporal cues without increasing RGB density.

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6 tokens\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a token \u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6574\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56 token \u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 LLM2Vec \u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684 masked next-token prediction (MNTP)\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6 tokens\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528 token \u7ea7\u522b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b (LLM2Comp)\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u5177\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347 LLM \u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification.Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities.

Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Neighbor GRPO: A novel alignment algorithm that bypasses the need for SDEs by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy.", "motivation": "Applying Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm, and current SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling.", "method": "Proposes Neighbor GRPO, an alignment algorithm that perturbs the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy.

Recent work finds that language models can use tools in ways that contradict the interests or explicit instructions of the user.

We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates.

While generative models have advanced material synthesis, existing methods lack a unified representation bridging natural image appearance and PBR properties, leading to fragmented task-specific pipelines and inability to leverage large-scale RGB image data. We present MatPedia, a foundation model built upon a novel joint RGB-PBR representation that compactly encodes materials into two interdependent latents: one for RGB appearance and one for the four PBR maps encoding complementary physical properties. By formulating them as a 5-frame sequence and employing video diffusion architectures, MatPedia naturally captures their correlations while transferring visual priors from RGB generation models. This joint representation enables a unified framework handling multiple material tasks--text-to-material generation, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition--within a single architecture.

Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as \"I don't know\", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u6d41\u7545\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u5373\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u5f03\u6743\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u4fdd\u969c\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8f93\u51fa\u201c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u201d\u7b49\u77ed\u8bed\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u540e\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u751f\u6210\u53d8\u5f02\u6216\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u9884\u5148\u963b\u6b62\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u540e\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u9884\u5148\u963b\u6b62\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f03\u6743\uff08ABCA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u6790LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5f03\u6743\u3002ABCA \u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u542f\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5f03\u6743\uff1a\u7c7b\u578b 1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7c7b\u578b 2\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u5e94\u59cb\u7ec8\u652f\u6301\u5f03\u6743\uff08\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cABCA \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f03\u6743\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5f03\u6743\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ABCA \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u6790 LLM \u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5f03\u6743\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cABCA \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f03\u6743\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5f03\u6743\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients (\"retain-invariant\"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects.

However, when the actual degradation deviates from these assumptions, these methods may experience significant declines in performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network to address the blind SR problem. While some blind SR methods assume noise-free degradation and others do not explicitly consider the presence of noise in the degradation model, our approach predicts two unsupervised degradation embeddings that represent blurry and noisy information.

Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7684Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAGFF \u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7eaf\u8bed\u4e49\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6218\u7565\u6027\u5730\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps. The resulting dataset provides twice-daily, 1 km LST observations for the entire pan-Arctic region over four decades. This enhanced dataset enables improved modelling of permafrost, reconstruction of near-surface air temperature, and assessment of surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Additionally, it supports climate monitoring efforts in the pre-MODIS era and offers a framework adaptable to future satellite missions for thermal infrared observation and climate data record continuity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6cdb\u5317\u6781\u5730\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4eceAVHRR GAC\u6570\u636e\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52301\u516c\u91cc\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "AVHRR GAC\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7c97\u7cd9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5206\u6790\u5317\u6781\u5730\u533a\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6c38\u4e45\u51bb\u571f\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u8868\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06AVHRR GAC\u6570\u636e\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52301\u516c\u91cc\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528MODIS LST\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u548c\u690d\u88ab\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a42\u5e74\u7684\u6cdb\u5317\u6781LST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6574\u4e2a\u6cdb\u5317\u6781\u5730\u533a\u8d85\u8fc7\u56db\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u4e24\u6b21\u30011\u516c\u91cc\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684LST\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u8fdb\u6c38\u4e45\u51bb\u571f\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8fd1\u5730\u8868\u6c14\u6e29\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u683c\u9675\u5170\u51b0\u76d6\u8868\u9762\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u524dMODIS\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684 Arctic \u6c14\u5019\u76d1\u6d4b\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns\" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries.

Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents.

The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams. Second, we present the SQ metric, a novel measure that captures the synergy between ensemble members and consistently aligns with ensemble accuracy. Third, we validate our SQ approach through extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset, which demonstrates that our SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy.

PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low \"follow rates\" ($\\leq 11\\%$, GPT-5: 4\\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response.

Code to be released upon full publication", "summary": "Sampling useful three-dimensional molecular structures along with their most favorable conformations is a key challenge in drug discovery. Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time. Finally, FlexiFlow can be successfully transferred to the protein-conditioned ligand generation task, even when the dataset contains only static pockets without accompanying conformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FlexiFlow\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8054\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u591a\u79cd\u6784\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u6392\u5217\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u76843D\u4ece\u5934\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u5339\u914d\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5355\u4e00\u6784\u8c61\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4e0e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9776\u6807\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u7ec4\u5177\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6784\u8c61\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6240\u9700\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "FlexiFlow\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6d41\u52a8\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u8054\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u591a\u79cd\u6784\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u6392\u5217\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728QM9\u548cGEOM Drugs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlexiFlow\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u5f20\u529b\u3001\u72ec\u7279\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "FlexiFlow\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u914d\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u6ca1\u6709\u4f34\u968f\u6784\u8c61\u7684\u9759\u6001\u53e3\u888b\u3002"}}

However, increasingly complex radio propagation behavior and surrounding environments pose strong challenges for radiomap estimation (RME). In this work, we propose a knowledge-guided RME framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), namely RadioKMoE. Specifically, we design a KAN module to predict an initial coarse coverage map, leveraging KAN's strength in approximating physics models and global radio propagation patterns.

Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity. Our findings suggest that visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction and that, when properly fused, self-supervised transformers and supervised deep convolutional neural networks offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.", "AI": {"tldr": "DReX is a vision-only model for predicting image complexity that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations.", "motivation": "Understanding human perception of image complexity is important for computer vision tasks and cognitive science.", "method": "DReX fuses multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16 using a learnable attention mechanism.", "result": "DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark and generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics.", "conclusion": "Visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction, and fusing self-supervised transformers with supervised deep convolutional neural networks offers synergistic benefits."}}

While existing approaches focus primarily on common actions like retweeting and liking, the prediction of rare but significant behaviors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for social media user behavior prediction that addresses both frequent and infrequent actions across a diverse action vocabulary. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale Bluesky dataset containing 6.4 million conversation threads spanning 12 distinct user actions across 25 persona clusters. Our methodology combines four complementary approaches: (i) a lookup database system based on historical response patterns; (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered temporal and semantic features for common actions; (iii) a specialized hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare action classification; and (iv) generation of text replies.

SAVeD addresses a common challenge in data science of repeated labor due to a difficulty of similar work or transformations on datasets. SAVeD employs a modified SimCLR pipeline, generating augmented table views through random transformations (e.g., row deletion, encoding perturbations). These views are embedded via a custom transformer encoder and contrasted in latent space to optimize semantic similarity. Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables. We evaluate performance using validation accuracy and separation, defined respectively as the proportion of correctly classified version/non-version pairs on a hold-out set, and the difference between average similarities of versioned and non-versioned tables (defined by a benchmark, and not provided to the model).

In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These results indicate that MVLR offers a practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6062\u590d\uff08MVLR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6062\u590d\u5404\u79cd\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e0d\u540c\u9000\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u4e0b\u96e8\u3001\u96fe\u973e\u3001\u4e0b\u96ea\u6216\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u6237\u5916\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u800c\u8a00\u662f\u7406\u60f3\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "MVLR\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\uff08IMB\uff09\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002VLM\u6267\u884c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801\u5929\u6c14\u9000\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\uff0cIMB\u5b58\u50a8\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u3002VLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u67e5\u8be2IMB\u4ee5\u68c0\u7d22\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u9000\u5316\u539f\u578b\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMVLR\u5728\u5cf0\u503c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08PSNR\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08SSIM\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5355\u5206\u652f\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "MVLR\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6237\u5916\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u5357\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u793e\u4f1a\u6311\u6218\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f7f\u653f\u5e9c\u90e8\u95e8\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528LLM\u5bf9\u5357\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u793e\u4f1a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM GPT-3.5\u3001GPT-4\u3001LlaMa 2\u3001PaLM 2\u548cDolly 2\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a7610\u4e2a\u5357\u975e\u653f\u5e9c\u90e8\u95e8\u7ba1\u8f96\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u82f1\u8bed\u3001Sepedi\u548cSetswana\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d10\u4e2a\u6700\u70ed\u95e8\u8bdd\u9898\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6781\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5404\u79cdLLM\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u878d\u5408\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u751f\u6210\u5173\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u793e\u4f1a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u51fa\u5173\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u53d6\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus.

As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.\n  We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes.

However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of ReBaPL on several benchmark datasets, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for prompt learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u6392\u65a5\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60 (ReBaPL)\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5faa\u73af\u6b65\u957f\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6 Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6392\u65a5\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 ReBaPL \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ReBaPL \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We used the generalized additive model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours that are tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline.

Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications.

While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ffd\u9003\u7b56\u7565 (R2PS)\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8ffd\u9003\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u7b56\u7565\u975e\u5e38\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8003\u8651\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u56e0\u7d20\u65f6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u535a\u5f08\u52a8\u6001\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u606f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u5230\u9003\u907f\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u8ffd\u6355\u8005\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8ffd\u9003\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212 (DP) \u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9003\u907f\u8005\u5f02\u6b65\u79fb\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u30022. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u9003\u907f\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06 DP \u8ffd\u9010\u7b56\u7565\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u73af\u5883\u30023. \u5c06\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684 EPG \u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86 R2PS \u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u535a\u5f08\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ffd\u9003\u7b56\u7565 (R2PS)\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Without any manual layout design or panoramic image guidance, our framework can generate explicit layout criteria for rational spatial placement. We begin by introducing a hierarchical structure of language-driven agent planners that can automatically parse short and ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions. These descriptions include raw spatial and semantic attributes for each object and the background, which are then used to initialize 3D point clouds. To position objects within bounded environments, we implement two arrangement constraints that iteratively optimize spatial arrangements, ensuring a collision-free and accessible layout solution. In the final rendering stage, we propose a novel AnyReach Sampling strategy for camera trajectory, along with the Interval Timestep Flow Sampling (ITFS) strategy, to efficiently optimize the coarse 3D Gaussian scene representation.

Coreset selection aims to accelerate training by identifying small, representative subsets of data that approximate the performance of the full dataset. Among various approaches, gradient based methods stand out due to their strong theoretical underpinnings and practical benefits, particularly under limited data budgets. However, these methods face challenges such as naive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) acting as a surprisingly strong baseline and the breakdown of representativeness due to loss curvature mismatches over time.\n  In this work, we propose a novel framework that addresses these limitations. First, we establish a connection between posterior sampling and loss landscapes, enabling robust coreset selection even in high data corruption scenarios. Second, we introduce a smoothed loss function based on posterior sampling onto the model weights, enhancing stability and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. We also present a novel convergence analysis for our sampling-based coreset selection method.

Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models.

Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime.

However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6OmniPT\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5730\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u8fdb\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LVLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u522b\u7406\u89e3\u88ab\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u6b63\u662fLVLMs\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6240\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542bRL-Mid Training-SFT-RL\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u9996\u5148\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684RL\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8f93\u51fa\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u683c\u5f0f\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u4e0e\u884c\u4eba\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2aRL\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniPT\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg.

We propose RL-AD-Net, a reinforcement learning (RL) refinement framework that operates in the latent space of a pretrained point autoencoder. The autoencoder encodes completions into compact global feature vectors (GFVs), which are selectively adjusted by an RL agent to improve geometric fidelity. To ensure robustness, a lightweight non-parametric PointNN selector evaluates the geometric consistency of both the original completion and the RL-refined output, retaining the better reconstruction. When ground truth is available, both Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics guide refinement. Training is performed separately per category, since the unsupervised and dynamic nature of RL makes convergence across highly diverse categories challenging. Nevertheless, the framework can be extended to multi-category refinement in future work. Experiments on ShapeNetCore-2048 demonstrate that while baseline completion networks perform reasonable under their training-style cropping, they struggle in random cropping scenarios.

Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via \"masked-then-fill\" and \"step reordering\" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning.

To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration. Experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate that MAPT significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of performance and exhibits substantial computational time advantages compared to classical operations research methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6307\u9488Transformer (MAPT)\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u96c6\u4e2d\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u968f\u673a\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u534f\u540c\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u6001\u53d6\u8d27\u548c\u4ea4\u4ed8\u95ee\u9898(MVDPDPSR)\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u8054\u5408\u884c\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6355\u83b7\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u5927\u7684\u8054\u5408\u884c\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u5b9e\u4f53\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6307\u9488\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u8054\u5408\u884c\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMAPT\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "MAPT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3MVDPDPSR\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance.

While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks. By regulating representation changes where past knowledge is encoded, InTAct achieves a principled balance between stability and plasticity. Across diverse domain-incremental benchmarks, including DomainNet and ImageNet-R, InTAct consistently reduces representation drift and improves performance, increasing Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aInTAct\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eprompt\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "InTAct\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u83b7\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5c42\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u529f\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u589e\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cInTAct \u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728 DomainNet \u548c ImageNet-R \u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 8 \u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "InTAct \u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u53bb\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Our analysis reveals the pivotal component of the feature map as a key factor governing diversity formation at early scales. By suppressing the pivotal component in the model input and amplifying it in the model output, DiverseVAR effectively unlocks the inherent generative potential of VAR models while preserving high-fidelity synthesis.

Submitted to Computers in Biology and Medicine", "summary": "Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a cornerstone in biomolecular analysis, offering precise identification of pathogens through unique mass spectral signatures. Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions.

Specifically, we first introduce a Gaussian information field to perceive the optimal sparse viewpoints from candidate camera poses. Then we compress 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians to facilitate accurate estimation of normal and depth. The planar Gaussians are optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion. Moreover, we introduce a part segmentation probability for each Gaussian primitive and update them by back-projecting part segmentation masks of renderings.

To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u91cf\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u201c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76f8\u4f3c\u201d\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8RL\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u201c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76f8\u4f3c\u201d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u672a\u77e5\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8bc6\u522b\u54ea\u4e9b\u5176\u4ed6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u6d88\u9664\u548c\u96f6\u9636\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6267\u884c\u540c\u6b65\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u96c6\u7fa4\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4e0b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u96c6\u7fa4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0e\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u989d\u5916\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7edf\u8ba1\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u4f1a\u56e0\u5305\u542b\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u3002"}}

Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\\% and 16.04\\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReCoVAD\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u901a\u8def\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5e27\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u522b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c6\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "method": "ReCoVAD\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u901a\u8def\uff1a(i) \u53cd\u5c04\u901a\u8def\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CLIP\u6a21\u5757\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u51b3\u7b56\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u53bb\u5e27\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b(ii) \u610f\u8bc6\u901a\u8def\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\u3002\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u671f\u5ba1\u67e5\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "ReCoVAD\u5728UCF-Crime\u548cXD-Violence\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u5904\u7406\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5e27\u768428.55\uff05\u548c16.04\uff05\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u7406\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684VAD\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u7406\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient.

Although recent studies have achieved notable improvements by leveraging the knowledge embedded within pre-trained visual models, the lack of direct association between factual-level features and emotional categories, called the \"affective gap\", limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for VER tasks. On the contrary, the explicit emotional expression and high information density in textual modality eliminate the \"affective gap\". Therefore, we propose borrowing the knowledge from the pre-trained textual model to enhance the emotional perception of pre-trained visual models. We focus on the factual and emotional connections between images and texts in noisy social media data, and propose Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to leverage these connections. Specifically, we manage to separate different types of samples and devise distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type.

However, even leading models exhibit redundant self-reflection when generating lengthy reasoning chains. While training-free CoT compression methods have emerged in the LLMs domain, they rely on static visual references and thus provide limited gains for multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we propose ChainV, a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into the reasoning process, thereby making multimodal reasoning shorter and better. Specifically, ChainV first performs a coarse visual patch selection based on the previous reasoning step, then refines it by identifying the most representative atomic visual hint according to the averaged attention intensity. Additionally, ChainV introduces a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to assess the reliability of the chosen hint, guiding the model to adaptively adjust its level of self-reflection. Eventually, the pixel coordinates of the selected visual hint and its reliability are incorporated into thinking with a Bernoulli stochastic process. Experiments indicate that our method significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, especially on math-intensive benchmarks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning.

This paper demonstrates that transitioning from 1D CCT (on the Planckian locus) to a 2D chromaticity space (off the Planckian locus) improves colorimetric accuracy across various mapping approaches. In addition, we replace conventional CCT interpolation with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that leverages 2D chromaticity features for robust colorimetric mapping under non-Planckian illuminants. A lightbox-based calibration procedure incorporating representative LED sources is used to train our MLP.

This work presents a complete, multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient, hardware-friendly integer-based implementations. First, we address the fundamental problem of quantization-induced performance degradation. We propose a Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) method that uses statistically-calibrated activation clipping and a novel weight regularization scheme to counteract the effects of extreme data outliers and large dynamic ranges, successfully creating a high-fidelity 8-bit integer model. Second, building on this robust foundation, we introduce two hardware-aware optimization techniques tailored for FPGAs. A progressive mixed-precision search algorithm exploits FPGA flexibility to assign optimal, non-uniform bit-widths to each layer, minimizing complexity while preserving performance.

Our comprehensive experiments show that the foundational DRAQ method reduces the BD-rate overhead of a GDN-based model from $30\\%$ to $6.3\\%$.

However, since these methods typically rely on denoising human-crafted trajectory anchors or random noise, there remains significant room for improvement. In this paper, we propose DiffRefiner, a novel two-stage trajectory prediction framework. The first stage uses a transformer-based Proposal Decoder to generate coarse trajectory predictions by regressing from sensor inputs using predefined trajectory anchors. The second stage applies a Diffusion Refiner that iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions. In this way, we enhance the performance of diffusion-based planning by incorporating a discriminative trajectory proposal module, which provides strong guidance for the generative refinement process.

To mitigate this issue, it is practical to develop unpaired image translation (UIT) methods that effectively align the statistical distributions between source and target domains, particularly under the constraint of a reused inference-blackbox setting. However, existing UIT approaches often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation, resulting in misaligned content-class mappings that can impair diagnostic accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose UI-Styler, a novel ultrasound-specific, class-aware image style transfer framework. UI-Styler leverages a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns embedded in the target images onto source images while preserving the source structural content. In addition, we introduce a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain, which enforces accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories. Extensive experiments on ultrasound cross-device tasks demonstrate that UI-Styler consistently outperforms existing UIT methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in distribution distance and downstream tasks, such as classification and segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u58f0\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff08UI-Styler\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907domain shift\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\uff08UIT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5bb9-\u7c7b\u522b\u6620\u5c04\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UI-Styler\u3002", "method": "UI-Styler\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6e90\u7ed3\u6784\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7531\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u58f0\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUI-Styler\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684UIT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u5272\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UI-Styler\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets.

Equivariance to rotations is achieved through the C4 cyclic group via the e2cnn library,enabling consistent performance under geometric transformations while reducing computational overhead.\n  Our approach introduces structured pruning that preserves equivariant properties by analyzing e2cnn layer structure and applying neuron-level pruning to fully connected components. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we implement adaptive fine-tuning that automatically triggers when accuracy drop exceeds 2%, using early stopping and learning rate scheduling for efficient recovery. The framework includes dynamic INT8 quantization and a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training, knowledge distillation, structured pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization.\n  We evaluate our method on satellite imagery (EuroSAT) and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, Rotated MNIST) demonstrating effectiveness across diverse domains. Experimental results show 29.3% parameter reduction with significant accuracy recovery, demonstrating that structured pruning of equivariant networks achieves substantial compression while maintaining geometric robustness.

Yet, recognizing traffic signs at night remains challenging due to visual noise and scarcity of public nighttime datasets. Despite advances in vision architectures, existing methods struggle with robustness under low illumination and fail to leverage complementary mutlimodal cues effectively. To overcome these limitations, firstly, we introduce INTSD, a large-scale dataset comprising street-level night-time images of traffic signboards collected across diverse regions of India. The dataset spans 41 traffic signboard classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for both detection and classification tasks. To benchmark INTSD for night-time sign recognition, we conduct extensive evaluations using state-of-the-art detection and classification models. Secondly, we propose LENS-Net, which integrates an adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, followed by a structured multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier that leverages cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning for robust and semantically consistent recognition.

In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format.

When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption. However, most prior efforts are optimized for semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.", "AI": {"tldr": "MuM\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55MAE\u5230\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eDINOv3\u548cCroCo v2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u8f83\u5c11\u3002CroCo\u662f\u4e3a3D\u7406\u89e3\u5b9a\u5236\u7684MAE\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MAE\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u540c\u4e00\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "MuM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u524d\u9988\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eDINOv3\u548cCroCo v2\u3002", "conclusion": "MuM\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e14\u57283D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

We find that existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies; such suboptimal designs not only limit camera control precision but also result in generated videos that fail to preserve fine visual details from the source video. To achieve more accurate and flexible motion manipulation, PostCam introduces a query-shared cross-attention module. It integrates two distinct forms of control signals: the 6-DoF camera poses and the 2D rendered video frames. By fusing them into a unified representation within a shared feature space, our model can extract underlying motion cues, which enhances both control precision and generation quality. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: the model first learns coarse camera control from pose inputs, and then incorporates visual information to refine motion accuracy and enhance visual fidelity. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that PostCam outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality.

Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset.

To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios.

Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks.

In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework.

Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers. Experiments on our CultureBench demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u7acb\u6216\u504f\u5411\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u975e\u7f3a\u5c11\u6587\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6587\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u5c11\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6587\u5316\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u76ee\u6807\u6587\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6587\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5e26\u6709\u6587\u5316\u5185\u6db5\uff0c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e94\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u6587\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1. \u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709T2I\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u6587\u5316\u503e\u5411\u3002 2. \u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002 3. \u4e24\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff1a  - \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6587\u5316\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1a\u589e\u5f3a\u5df2\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002  - \u5c42\u7ea7\u76ee\u6807\u6587\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\uff1a\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u6587\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6587\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
