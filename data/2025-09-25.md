### [1] [Automated Item Neutralization for Non-Cognitive Scales: A Large Language Model Approach to Reducing Social-Desirability Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19314)
*Sirui Wu,Daijin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型 (LLM) 辅助的项目中和，以减少人格评估中的社会期望偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是减少人格评估中的社会期望偏差。

Method: 使用 GPT-o3 重写国际人格项目池大五量表 (IPIP-BFM-50)，并让 203 名参与者完成原始或中和形式以及马洛-克劳恩社会期望量表。

Result: 结果表明，可靠性得到保留，五因素结构得到保留，尽责性有所提高，宜人性和开放性有所下降。与社会期望的相关性对于某些项目有所下降，但不一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持 AI 中和作为一种潜在但并不完善的偏差减少方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates item neutralization assisted by the large language model
(LLM) to reduce social desirability bias in personality assessment. GPT-o3 was
used to rewrite the International Personality Item Pool Big Five Measure
(IPIP-BFM-50), and 203 participants completed either the original or
neutralized form along with the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale. The
results showed preserved reliability and a five-factor structure, with gains in
Conscientiousness and declines in Agreeableness and Openness. The correlations
with social desirability decreased for several items, but inconsistently.
Configural invariance held, though metric and scalar invariance failed.
Findings support AI neutralization as a potential but imperfect bias-reduction
method.

### [2] [FHIR-AgentBench: Benchmarking LLM Agents for Realistic Interoperable EHR Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19319)
*Gyubok Lee,Elea Bach,Eric Yang,Tom Pollard,Alistair Johnson,Edward Choi,Yugang jia,Jong Ha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为FHIR-AgentBench的基准，用于评估LLM agent在HL7 FHIR标准下的临床数据上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准缺乏评估LLM在可互操作的临床数据上的现实性，无法满足新的需求。

Method: 构建了一个基于2,931个真实世界临床问题的基准，并系统地评估了不同的数据检索、交互模式和推理策略。

Result: 实验揭示了从复杂的FHIR资源中检索数据以及对其进行推理的实际挑战，这些挑战严重影响了问答性能。

Conclusion: 发布FHIR-AgentBench数据集和评估套件，以促进可重复的研究和开发用于临床应用的鲁棒、可靠的LLM agent。

Abstract: The recent shift toward the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) standard opens a new frontier for
clinical AI, demanding LLM agents to navigate complex, resource-based data
models instead of conventional structured health data. However, existing
benchmarks have lagged behind this transition, lacking the realism needed to
evaluate recent LLMs on interoperable clinical data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce FHIR-AgentBench, a benchmark that grounds 2,931 real-world clinical
questions in the HL7 FHIR standard. Using this benchmark, we systematically
evaluate agentic frameworks, comparing different data retrieval strategies
(direct FHIR API calls vs. specialized tools), interaction patterns
(single-turn vs. multi-turn), and reasoning strategies (natural language vs.
code generation). Our experiments highlight the practical challenges of
retrieving data from intricate FHIR resources and the difficulty of reasoning
over them, both of which critically affect question answering performance. We
publicly release the FHIR-AgentBench dataset and evaluation suite
(https://github.com/glee4810/FHIR-AgentBench) to promote reproducible research
and the development of robust, reliable LLM agents for clinical applications.

### [3] [Readme_AI: Dynamic Context Construction for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19322)
*Millie Vyas,Timothy Blattner,Alden Dima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种动态构建数据源上下文的规范，以提升大型语言模型（LLM）在特定查询下的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在用户特定查询背景下，可能会提供不准确或不可靠的信息。提供特定于查询的上下文可以显著提高LLM回应的有效性。

Method: 提出一种规范，用于动态构建数据源的上下文。数据源所有者创建包含元数据的文件，供LLM在推理与数据集相关的查询时使用。创建了一个原型Readme_AI模型上下文协议（MCP）服务器，用于从数据源检索元数据并动态构建上下文。该规范的动态特性体现在可扩展的类型上，这些类型表示抓取网页、从数据存储库获取数据、下载和解析出版物以及通用文本。

Result: 通过使用Readme_AI，LLM接收到足够的上下文，能够推理Hedgehog库及其使用，甚至可以从Hedgehog开发者提供的Readme_AI文件中包含的示例中生成代码。

Conclusion: 本论文的主要贡献是一个可扩展的协议，用于在专门的、所有者提供的数据中动态地grounding LLM，从而增强LLM的回应并减少幻觉。

Abstract: Despite being trained on significant amounts of data, Large Language Models
(LLMs) can provide inaccurate or unreliable information in the context of a
user's specific query. Given query-specific context significantly improves the
usefulness of its responses. In this paper, we present a specification that can
be used to dynamically build context for data sources. The data source owner
creates the file containing metadata for LLMs to use when reasoning about
dataset-related queries. To demonstrate our proposed specification, we created
a prototype Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that retrieves the
metadata from the data source and uses it to dynamically build context. Some
features that make this specification dynamic are the extensible types that
represent crawling web-pages, fetching data from data repositories, downloading
and parsing publications, and general text. The context is formatted and
grouped using user-specified tags that provide clear contextual information for
the LLM to reason about the content. We demonstrate the capabilities of this
early prototype by asking the LLM about the NIST-developed Hedgehog library,
for which common LLMs often provides inaccurate and irrelevant responses
containing hallucinations. With Readme_AI, the LLM receives enough context that
it is now able to reason about the library and its use, and even generate code
interpolated from examples that were included in the Readme_AI file provided by
Hedgehog's developer. Our primary contribution is a extensible protocol for
dynamically grounding LLMs in specialized, owner-provided data, enhancing
responses from LLMs and reducing hallucinations. The source code for the
Readme_AI tool is posted here: https://github.com/usnistgov/readme_ai .

### [4] [Play by the Type Rules: Inferring Constraints for LLM Functions in Declarative Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20208)
*Parker Glenn,Alfy Samuel,Daben Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 将LLM算子集成到声明式查询语言中，结合了廉价且可解释的函数与强大的、可泛化的语言模型推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了受益于像SQL这样的数据库查询语言的优化执行，生成的输出必须与类型检查器和数据库内容强制执行的规则对齐。目前的方法使用由许多基于LLM的后处理调用组成的编排来解决这一挑战，以确保生成的输出和数据库值之间的一致性，从而导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 对各种规模的开源语言模型在基于SQL的查询语言中解析和执行函数的能力进行了研究，表明小型语言模型可以作为混合数据源上的函数执行器表现出色。提出了一种有效的解决方案来强制执行LLM函数的良好类型，

Result: 在多跳问答数据集上，准确率提高了7%，延迟比同类解决方案提高了53%。

Conclusion: 在https://github.com/parkervg/blendsql上提供了我们的实现。

Abstract: Integrating LLM powered operators in declarative query languages allows for
the combination of cheap and interpretable functions with powerful,
generalizable language model reasoning. However, in order to benefit from the
optimized execution of a database query language like SQL, generated outputs
must align with the rules enforced by both type checkers and database contents.
Current approaches address this challenge with orchestrations consisting of
many LLM-based post-processing calls to ensure alignment between generated
outputs and database values, introducing performance bottlenecks. We perform a
study on the ability of various sized open-source language models to both parse
and execute functions within a query language based on SQL, showing that small
language models can excel as function executors over hybrid data sources. Then,
we propose an efficient solution to enforce the well-typedness of LLM
functions, demonstrating 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question
answering dataset with 53% improvement in latency over comparable solutions. We
make our implementation available at https://github.com/parkervg/blendsql

### [5] [Magnitude Matters: a Superior Class of Similarity Metrics for Holistic Semantic Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19323)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了新的向量相似度计算方法，在特定任务上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点积和余弦相似度在高维向量比较中存在局限性。

Method: 提出了 Overlap Similarity (OS) 和 Hyperbolic Tangent Similarity (HTS) 两种新的无参数、幅度感知的相似度指标。

Result: 在需要整体语义理解的任务（释义和推断）上，OS 和 HTS 在均方误差方面优于原始点积和余弦相似度。

Conclusion: 幅度感知的指标在需要整体语义理解的任务上表现更好，但在需要细致组合语义的任务上没有显著改进。

Abstract: Vector comparison in high dimensions is a fundamental task in NLP, yet it is
dominated by two baselines: the raw dot product, which is unbounded and
sensitive to vector norms, and the cosine similarity, which discards magnitude
information entirely. This paper challenges both standards by proposing and
rigorously evaluating a new class of parameter-free, magnitude-aware similarity
metrics. I introduce two such functions, Overlap Similarity (OS) and Hyperbolic
Tangent Similarity (HTS), designed to integrate vector magnitude and alignment
in a more principled manner. To ensure that my findings are robust and
generalizable, I conducted a comprehensive evaluation using four
state-of-the-art sentence embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2,
all-mpnet-base-v2, paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2, and BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) across
a diverse suite of eight standard NLP benchmarks, including STS-B, SICK, Quora,
and PAWS. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical significance, my
results are definitive: on the tasks requiring holistic semantic understanding
(paraphrase and inference), both OS and HTS provide a statistically significant
improvement in Mean Squared Error over both the raw dot product and cosine
similarity, regardless of the underlying embedding model.Crucially, my findings
delineate the specific domain of advantage for these metrics: for tasks
requiring holistic semantic understanding like paraphrase and inference, my
magnitude-aware metrics offer a statistically superior alternative. This
significant improvement was not observed on benchmarks designed to test highly
nuanced compositional semantics (SICK, STS-B), identifying the challenge of
representing compositional text as a distinct and important direction for
future work.

### [6] [How Much of Your Data Can Suck? Thresholds for Domain Performance and Emergent Misalignment in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19325)
*Jian Ouyang,Arman T,Ge Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究错误数据对大型语言模型 (LLM) 在监督微调 (SFT) 期间的性能和安全性的影响，特别是 gpt-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然 LLM 在金融、编码、法律和健康等广泛领域变得越来越重要，但在不正确的数据上进行微调可能会导致“突发的不对齐”，从而产生与预期任务无关的有害或欺骗性输出。

Method: 我们评估了在四个领域（编码、金融、健康和法律）中，以不同比例（10% 到 90% 正确）的明显和微妙的错误数据微调的 gpt-4o 模型。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，即使是少量的错误数据（10-25%）也会显着降低领域性能，而非道德对齐。至少需要 50% 的正确数据才能使模型持续恢复强大的性能，尽管它们很少能与基本模型的稳健性和安全性相匹配，基本模型具有近乎完美的对齐和开箱即用的零危险完成。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了错误数据的代价是沉重的，突出了对极高质量数据管理的关键需求，或者，对于高风险应用，利用强大的基础模型而无需不必要的微调。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of incorrect data on the performance and
safety of large language models (LLMs), specifically gpt-4o, during supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Although LLMs become increasingly vital across broad domains
like finance, coding, law, and health, fine-tuning on incorrect data can lead
to "emergent misalignment," producing harmful or deceptive outputs unrelated to
the intended task. We evaluate gpt-4o models fine-tuned with varying ratios
(10\% to 90\% correct) of both obviously and subtly incorrect data across four
domains: coding, finance, health, and legal. Our findings show that even modest
amounts of incorrect data (10-25\%) dramatically degrade domain performance and
not moral alignment. A clear threshold of at least 50\% correct data is needed
for models to consistently recover strong performance, though they rarely match
the robustness and safety of the base model, which exhibits near-perfect
alignment and zero dangerous completions out-of-the-box. This research
emphasizes that the cost of incorrect data is heavy, highlighting the critical
need for extremely high-quality data curation or, alternatively, leveraging
robust base models without unnecessary fine-tuning for high-stakes
applications.

### [7] [Unveiling the Merits and Defects of LLMs in Automatic Review Generation for Scientific Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19326)
*Ruochi Li,Haoxuan Zhang,Edward Gehringer,Ting Xiao,Junhua Ding,Haihua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLM）自动生成评审意见的方法，并提出了一个综合评估框架来评估LLM生成的评审与人工评审的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统同行评审过程压力越来越大，因此探索使用LLM自动生成评审意见。

Method: 构建了一个大型基准数据集，包含来自ICLR和NeurIPS的1,683篇论文和6,495份专家评审，并使用五个LLM生成评审意见，然后使用语义相似性分析和结构化知识图指标进行评估。

Result: LLM在描述性和肯定性内容方面表现良好，但在识别弱点、提出实质性问题以及根据论文质量调整反馈方面表现不佳。例如，GPT-4o在好论文的优点部分生成的实体比人工评审员多15.74%，但在弱点方面生成的实体少59.42%。

Conclusion: LLM生成的评审在质量上与人工评审存在差距，尤其是在识别论文的弱点方面。这项研究为理解LLM生成评审的优缺点提供了经验基础，并为未来LLM辅助评审工具的开发提供了信息。

Abstract: The surge in scientific submissions has placed increasing strain on the
traditional peer-review process, prompting the exploration of large language
models (LLMs) for automated review generation. While LLMs demonstrate
competence in producing structured and coherent feedback, their capacity for
critical reasoning, contextual grounding, and quality sensitivity remains
limited. To systematically evaluate these aspects, we propose a comprehensive
evaluation framework that integrates semantic similarity analysis and
structured knowledge graph metrics to assess LLM-generated reviews against
human-written counterparts. We construct a large-scale benchmark of 1,683
papers and 6,495 expert reviews from ICLR and NeurIPS in multiple years, and
generate reviews using five LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs perform well in
descriptive and affirmational content, capturing the main contributions and
methodologies of the original work, with GPT-4o highlighted as an illustrative
example, generating 15.74% more entities than human reviewers in the strengths
section of good papers in ICLR 2025. However, they consistently underperform in
identifying weaknesses, raising substantive questions, and adjusting feedback
based on paper quality. GPT-4o produces 59.42% fewer entities than real
reviewers in the weaknesses and increases node count by only 5.7% from good to
weak papers, compared to 50% in human reviews. Similar trends are observed
across all conferences, years, and models, providing empirical foundations for
understanding the merits and defects of LLM-generated reviews and informing the
development of future LLM-assisted reviewing tools. Data, code, and more
detailed results are publicly available at

### [8] [A systematic review of trial-matching pipelines using large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19327)
*Braxton A. Morrison,Madhumita Sushil,Jacob S. Young*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究综述了2020年至2025年间使用大型语言模型(LLM)进行临床试验匹配的研究，发现GPT-4模型在匹配和资格提取方面表现优异，但成本较高。面临的挑战包括数据获取、成本、幻觉风险和偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工临床试验匹配耗时且容易出错，采用LLM的流程提供了一个有希望的解决方案。

Method: 系统回顾了2020年至2025年间三个学术数据库和一个预印本服务器上发表的关于基于LLM的临床试验匹配方法的研究，共纳入31篇符合标准的文章。

Result: GPT-4模型在直接比较的研究中表现优于其他模型，即使是经过微调的模型，但在匹配和资格提取方面成本更高。有希望的策略包括零样本提示、高级检索方法和微调小型开源模型。

Conclusion: 本综述总结了LLM在临床试验匹配中的应用进展，强调了有希望的方向和关键限制。标准化指标、更真实的测试集以及对成本效益和公平性的关注对于更广泛的部署至关重要。

Abstract: Matching patients to clinical trial options is critical for identifying novel
treatments, especially in oncology. However, manual matching is labor-intensive
and error-prone, leading to recruitment delays. Pipelines incorporating large
language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution. We conducted a systematic
review of studies published between 2020 and 2025 from three academic databases
and one preprint server, identifying LLM-based approaches to clinical trial
matching. Of 126 unique articles, 31 met inclusion criteria. Reviewed studies
focused on matching patient-to-criterion only (n=4), patient-to-trial only
(n=10), trial-to-patient only (n=2), binary eligibility classification only
(n=1) or combined tasks (n=14). Sixteen used synthetic data; fourteen used real
patient data; one used both. Variability in datasets and evaluation metrics
limited cross-study comparability. In studies with direct comparisons, the
GPT-4 model consistently outperformed other models, even finely-tuned ones, in
matching and eligibility extraction, albeit at higher cost. Promising
strategies included zero-shot prompting with proprietary LLMs like the GPT-4o
model, advanced retrieval methods, and fine-tuning smaller, open-source models
for data privacy when incorporation of large models into hospital
infrastructure is infeasible. Key challenges include accessing sufficiently
large real-world data sets, and deployment-associated challenges such as
reducing cost, mitigating risk of hallucinations, data leakage, and bias. This
review synthesizes progress in applying LLMs to clinical trial matching,
highlighting promising directions and key limitations. Standardized metrics,
more realistic test sets, and attention to cost-efficiency and fairness will be
critical for broader deployment.

### [9] [How Model Size, Temperature, and Prompt Style Affect LLM-Human Assessment Score Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19329)
*Julie Jung,Max Lu,Sina Chole Benker,Dogus Darici*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）的对齐方式受到模型大小、温度和提示风格的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在评估临床推理技能时，其内部、模型之间以及与人类的对齐程度。

Method: 检查模型大小、温度和提示风格对LLM对齐的影响

Result: 模型大小是LLM与人类评分对齐的关键因素。

Conclusion: 强调检查多个层面对齐方式的重要性。

Abstract: We examined how model size, temperature, and prompt style affect Large
Language Models' (LLMs) alignment within itself, between models, and with human
in assessing clinical reasoning skills. Model size emerged as a key factor in
LLM-human score alignment. Study highlights the importance of checking
alignments across multiple levels.

### [10] [Quantifying Compositionality of Classic and State-of-the-Art Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19332)
*Zhijin Guo,Chenhao Xue,Zhaozhen Xu,Hongbo Bo,Yuxuan Ye,Janet B. Pierrehumbert,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型中的组合性问题，特别是模型如何理解和泛化新表达式，例如“ten pelps”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态词嵌入模型（如Word2vec）在组合性方面过于强调，而Transformer模型和图模型则相反，对上下文引起的语义变化没有实际的限制。

Method: 论文提出了一种两步泛化评估方法：(1) 通过典型相关分析测量已知实体属性和它们的嵌入之间的线性关系；(2) 通过重建未见过的属性组合的嵌入并检查L2损失、余弦相似度和检索准确率等重建指标来评估加性泛化。

Result: 实验结果表明，在训练的后期阶段和基于Transformer模型的更深层中，可以观察到更强的组合信号，但在顶层有所下降。

Conclusion: 该研究量化了不同数据模式下的组合性，并观察到Transformer模型在不同层和训练阶段的组合性变化趋势。

Abstract: For language models to generalize correctly to novel expressions, it is
critical that they exploit access compositional meanings when this is
justified. Even if we don't know what a "pelp" is, we can use our knowledge of
numbers to understand that "ten pelps" makes more pelps than "two pelps".
Static word embeddings such as Word2vec made strong, indeed excessive, claims
about compositionality. The SOTA generative, transformer models and graph
models, however, go too far in the other direction by providing no real limits
on shifts in meaning due to context. To quantify the additive compositionality,
we formalize a two-step, generalized evaluation that (i) measures the linearity
between known entity attributes and their embeddings via canonical correlation
analysis, and (ii) evaluates additive generalization by reconstructing
embeddings for unseen attribute combinations and checking reconstruction
metrics such as L2 loss, cosine similarity, and retrieval accuracy. These
metrics also capture failure cases where linear composition breaks down.
Sentences, knowledge graphs, and word embeddings are evaluated and tracked the
compositionality across all layers and training stages. Stronger compositional
signals are observed in later training stages across data modalities, and in
deeper layers of the transformer-based model before a decline at the top layer.

### [11] [Pluralistic Off-policy Evaluation and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19333)
*Chengkai Huang,Junda Wu,Zhouhang Xie,Yu Xia,Rui Wang,Tong Yu,Subrata Mitra,Julian McAuley,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为POPE的离线评估和对齐框架，用于在LLM中实现多元偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好对齐数据集与被评估的LLM差异显著，且现有的异策略估计器只关注整体效用而忽略了偏好多元化，因此需要扩展异策略评估以适应多元偏好对齐。

Method: 提出了POPE，它包含一个统一的奖励函数，该函数结合了来自人类偏好信号的协作效用组件和受熵启发的多样性组件。此外，还推导出了可分解的逆倾向得分（IPS）估计器，以分别评估相关性和多样性。

Result: 实验结果表明，POPE有效地增强了多元化响应生成，并保持了模型在下游任务中的通用能力。

Conclusion: POPE框架能够提升LLM的多元偏好对齐效果，同时保持其通用能力。

Abstract: Personalized preference alignment for LLMs with diverse human preferences
requires evaluation and alignment methods that capture pluralism. Most existing
preference alignment datasets are logged under policies that differ
substantially from the evaluated LLMs, and existing off-policy estimators focus
solely on overall utility while ignoring preference pluralism. Extending
Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) to pluralistic preference alignment, therefore,
remains an open question. Thus, we propose the Pluralistic Off-Policy
Evaluation (POPE), the first framework for offline pluralistic preference
evaluation and alignment in LLMs. POPE includes a unified reward function that
combines (1) a collaborative utility component derived from human preference
signals (e.g., upvotes or relevance scores) and (2) a diversity component
inspired by entropy-based coverage measures, together reflecting pluralistic
alignment. Furthermore, to estimate this reward from logged interactions, we
derive decomposable inverse propensity scoring (IPS) estimators that separately
evaluate relevance and diversity. Theoretically, we prove that our decomposed
IPS estimators establish a lower bound on their variance. With the off-policy
evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to
further enhance pluralistic alignment. Empirical results demonstrate that POPE
efficiently enhances pluralistic response generation and maintains the models'
general capabilities on downstream tasks

### [12] [Cognitive-Level Adaptive Generation via Capability-Aware Retrieval and Style Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19336)
*Qingsong Wang,Tao Wu,Wang Lin,Yueying Feng,Gongsheng Yuan,Chang Yao,Jingyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为认知水平对齐框架（CLAF）的通用生成框架，旨在使大型语言模型（LLM）生成的内容在知识复杂度和表达风格上与用户的认知水平相匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在开放式生成任务中表现出色，但难以使内容适应不同认知能力的用户，导致认知错位。这种错位表现为知识水平错位（内容过于复杂或过于简单）和表达风格错位（结构或语气妨碍理解）。

Method: CLAF集成了基于分层知识图谱的能力感知检索模块和由布鲁姆分类学和偏好学习指导的风格优化模块。此外，知识可控生成组件确保输出的一致性和相关性。

Result: 实证结果表明，CLAF提高了LLM输出在各种用户 профиль 中的适应性和信息量。

Conclusion: CLAF为实际应用中的认知水平对齐提供了一个强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
open-ended generation tasks. However, they often struggle to adapt content to
users with differing cognitive capacities, leading to a phenomenon we term
cognitive misalignment. This issue arises in two forms: knowledge-level
misalignment, where content is too complex or too simplistic relative to user
understanding, and presentation-style misalignment, where the structure or tone
hinders effective comprehension. To address these challenges, we propose the
Cognitive-Level Alignment Framework (CLAF), a general-purpose generation
framework that aligns both knowledge complexity and presentation style with
user cognition. CLAF integrates a capability-aware retrieval module based on a
hierarchical knowledge graph and a style optimization module guided by Bloom's
taxonomy and preference learning. Additionally, a knowledge-controllable
generation component ensures consistency and relevance throughout the output.
To support training and evaluation, we construct SCALE, a cognitively annotated
dataset containing responses at multiple comprehension levels per query.
Empirical results show that CLAF enhances the adaptability and informativeness
of LLM outputs across a range of user profiles, offering a robust solution to
cognitive-level alignment in real-world applications.

*Shuyu Zhang,Yifan Wei,Jialuo Yuan,Xinru Wang,Yanmin Zhu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的对话策略学习框架DyBBT，它可以根据实时认知状态在快速直观推理和慢速审慎推理之间动态切换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的面向任务的对话系统通常依赖于静态探索策略，不能适应动态对话环境，导致探索效率低下和性能欠佳。

Method: DyBBT通过结构化的认知状态空间来形式化探索挑战，该空间捕捉对话进程、用户不确定性和槽依赖性。DyBBT提出了一个受bandit启发的元控制器，可以根据实时认知状态和访问计数在快速直观推理（系统1）和慢速审慎推理（系统2）之间动态切换。

Result: 在单域和多域基准上的大量实验表明，DyBBT在成功率、效率和泛化方面都达到了最先进的性能，人工评估证实其决策与专家判断高度一致。

Conclusion: DyBBT框架能够有效地提升对话系统的性能和效率。

Abstract: Task oriented dialog systems often rely on static exploration strategies that
do not adapt to dynamic dialog contexts, leading to inefficient exploration and
suboptimal performance. We propose DyBBT, a novel dialog policy learning
framework that formalizes the exploration challenge through a structured
cognitive state space capturing dialog progression, user uncertainty, and slot
dependency. DyBBT proposes a bandit inspired meta-controller that dynamically
switches between a fast intuitive inference (System 1) and a slow deliberative
reasoner (System 2) based on real-time cognitive states and visitation counts.
Extensive experiments on single- and multi-domain benchmarks show that DyBBT
achieves state-of-the-art performance in success rate, efficiency, and
generalization, with human evaluations confirming its decisions are well
aligned with expert judgment. Code is available at

*Alovi N Shohe,Chonglio Khiamungam,Teisovi Angami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文是首次尝试对 Nagamese 语⾔进⾏词性标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对 Nagamese 语⾔的词性标注研究。

Method: 创建了包含 16,112 个 token 的注释语料库，并应⽤了条件随机场 (CRF) 机器学 习技术。

Result: 使⽤ CRF 获得了 85.70% 的整体标注准确率；精度、召回率均为 86%，f1-score 为 85%。

Conclusion: 该研究为 Nagamese 语⾔的词性标注提供了⼀个基线，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates part-of-speech tagging, an important task in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) for the Nagamese language. The Nagamese language,
a.k.a. Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified Creole language developed primarily
as a means of communication in trade between the Nagas and people from Assam in
northeast India. A substantial amount of work in part-of-speech-tagging has
been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no
work has been done in the Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first attempt at part-of-speech tagging for the Nagamese Language. The

*Shuyu Zhang,Yifan Wei,Xinru Wang,Yanmin Zhu,Yangfan He,Yixuan Weng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为HiCoLoRA的框架，通过增强prompt对齐来改进零样本对话状态跟踪（zs-DST）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本对话状态跟踪对于使面向任务的对话系统推广到新领域至关重要，但动态对话上下文和静态prompt之间的语义错位导致了不灵活的跨层协调、领域干扰和灾难性遗忘。

Method: 该框架具有用于动态层特定处理的分层LoRA架构，集成了谱联合域-槽聚类以识别可转移的关联，并采用语义增强的SVD初始化以保留预训练知识。

Result: 在MultiWOZ和SGD多领域数据集上的实验表明，HiCoLoRA优于基线，在zs-DST中实现了SOTA。

Conclusion: HiCoLoRA框架通过prompt对齐，有效提升了零样本对话状态跟踪的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Dialog State Tracking (zs-DST) is essential for enabling
Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODs) to generalize to new domains without costly
data annotation. A central challenge lies in the semantic misalignment between
dynamic dialog contexts and static prompts, leading to inflexible cross-layer
coordination, domain interference, and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle this,
we propose Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA), a
framework that enhances zero-shot slot inference through robust prompt
alignment. It features a hierarchical LoRA architecture for dynamic
layer-specific processing (combining lower-layer heuristic grouping and
higher-layer full interaction), integrates Spectral Joint Domain-Slot
Clustering to identify transferable associations (feeding an Adaptive Linear
Fusion Mechanism), and employs Semantic-Enhanced SVD Initialization
(SemSVD-Init) to preserve pre-trained knowledge. Experiments on multi-domain
datasets MultiWOZ and SGD show that HiCoLoRA outperforms baselines, achieving
SOTA in zs-DST. Code is available at https://github.com/carsonz/HiCoLoRA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的文档解析系统评估框架SCORE，该框架能够容忍结构上的差异，同时保证语义上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多模态生成文档解析系统评估方法无法区分语义正确但结构不同的输出，会将这种多样性误判为错误，从而影响系统性能的评估。

Method: 该框架集成了调整后的编辑距离、token级别诊断、具有空间容忍和语义对齐的表格评估以及层次感知一致性检查等方法。

Result: SCORE在包含1114页的基准数据集和领域数据集上，揭示了传统指标无法发现的跨数据集性能模式。在2-5%的具有模糊表格结构的页面中，传统指标平均会惩罚系统12-25%，而SCORE纠正了这些情况。

Conclusion: SCORE通过揭示解释性多样性如何影响评估结果，并提供多维度、可解释的诊断，为现代文档解析系统的语义化、公平和实用基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multi-modal generative document parsing systems challenge traditional
evaluation: unlike deterministic OCR or layout models, they often produce
semantically correct yet structurally divergent outputs. Conventional
metrics-CER, WER, IoU, or TEDS-misclassify such diversity as error, penalizing
valid interpretations and obscuring system behavior.
  We introduce SCORE (Structural and COntent Robust Evaluation), an
interpretation-agnostic framework that integrates (i) adjusted edit distance
for robust content fidelity, (ii) token-level diagnostics to distinguish
hallucinations from omissions, (iii) table evaluation with spatial tolerance
and semantic alignment, and (iv) hierarchy-aware consistency checks. Together,
these dimensions enable evaluation that embraces representational diversity
while enforcing semantic rigor.
  Across 1,114 pages spanning a holistic benchmark and a field dataset, SCORE
consistently revealed cross-dataset performance patterns missed by standard
metrics. In 2-5% of pages with ambiguous table structures, traditional metrics
penalized systems by 12-25% on average, leading to distorted rankings. SCORE
corrected these cases, recovering equivalence between alternative but valid
interpretations. Moreover, by normalizing generative outputs into a
format-agnostic representation, SCORE reproduces traditional scores (e.g.,
table F1 up to 0.93) without requiring object-detection pipelines,
demonstrating that generative parsing alone suffices for comprehensive
evaluation.
  By exposing how interpretive diversity impacts evaluation outcomes and
providing multi-dimensional, interpretable diagnostics, SCORE establishes
foundational principles for semantically grounded, fair, and practical
benchmarking of modern document parsing systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新颖的双重视角方法，用于分析 Google Play 商店中 ChatGPT 和 DeepSeek 的用户评论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与之前孤立地关注基于词汇的策略或预测性深度学习模型的研究不同，本研究对基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的应用程序的用户满意度进行了广泛调查。

Method: 整合了基于词汇的情感分析 (TextBlob) 与深度学习分类模型，包括卷积神经网络 (CNN) 和双向长短期记忆 (Bi LSTM) 网络。收集了 4,000 条真实用户评论的数据集，经过仔细预处理和过采样以实现平衡的类。

Result: 实验结果表明，ChatGPT 比 DeepSeek 获得的情感明显更积极。此外，基于深度学习的分类表现优于词汇分析，其中 CNN 的表现优于 Bi-LSTM，实现了 96.41% 的准确率，并且几乎完美地分类了负面评论，同时中性和正面情绪的 F1 分数也很高。

Conclusion: 这项研究为衡量基于 LLM 的应用程序中的情绪设定了新的方法标准，并为寻求改进以用户为中心的人工智能系统设计的开发人员和研究人员提供了实用的见解。

Abstract: This study presents a novel dual-perspective approach to analyzing user
reviews for ChatGPT and DeepSeek on the Google Play Store, integrating
lexicon-based sentiment analysis (TextBlob) with deep learning classification
models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long
Short Term Memory (Bi LSTM) Networks. Unlike prior research, which focuses on
either lexicon-based strategies or predictive deep learning models in
isolation, this study conducts an extensive investigation into user
satisfaction with Large Language Model (LLM) based applications. A Dataset of
4,000 authentic user reviews was collected, which were carefully preprocessed
and subjected to oversampling to achieve balanced classes. The balanced test
set of 1,700 Reviews were used for model testing. Results from the experiments
reveal that ChatGPT received significantly more positive sentiment than
DeepSeek. Furthermore, deep learning based classification demonstrated superior
performance over lexicon analysis, with CNN outperforming Bi-LSTM by achieving
96.41 percent accuracy and near perfect classification of negative reviews,
alongside high F1-scores for neutral and positive sentiments. This research
sets a new methodological standard for measuring sentiment in LLM-based
applications and provides practical insights for developers and researchers
seeking to improve user-centric AI system design.

TL;DR: ShinkaEvolve是一个新的开源框架，它利用大型语言模型（LLM）以最先进的性能和前所未有的效率来推进科学发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代码进化方法效率低，且闭源，阻碍了广泛应用和扩展。

Method: ShinkaEvolve引入了三个关键创新：平衡探索和利用的父代抽样技术，用于有效搜索空间探索的代码新颖性拒绝抽样，以及基于bandit的LLM集成选择策略。

Result: ShinkaEvolve在各种任务中表现出样本效率和解决方案质量的持续改进。ShinkaEvolve仅使用150个样本就发现了一种新的最先进的圆形填充解决方案，为AIME数学推理任务设计了高性能的代理工具，识别了ALE-Bench竞争性编程解决方案的改进，并发现了新的混合专家负载平衡损失函数，从而阐明了优化策略的空间。

Conclusion: ShinkaEvolve具有广泛的适用性和卓越的样本效率。通过提供开源可访问性和成本效益，这项工作使跨各种计算问题的开放式发现大众化。

Abstract: We introduce ShinkaEvolve: a new open-source framework leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to advance scientific discovery with state-of-the-art
performance and unprecedented efficiency. Recent advances in scaling inference
time compute of LLMs have enabled significant progress in generalized
scientific discovery. These approaches rely on evolutionary agentic harnesses
that leverage LLMs as mutation operators to generate candidate solutions.
However, current code evolution methods suffer from critical limitations: they
are sample inefficient, requiring thousands of samples to identify effective
solutions, and remain closed-source, hindering broad adoption and extension.
ShinkaEvolve addresses these limitations, introducing three key innovations: a
parent sampling technique balancing exploration and exploitation, code novelty
rejection-sampling for efficient search space exploration, and a bandit-based
LLM ensemble selection strategy. We evaluate ShinkaEvolve across diverse tasks,
demonstrating consistent improvements in sample efficiency and solution
quality. ShinkaEvolve discovers a new state-of-the-art circle packing solution
using only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME
mathematical reasoning tasks, identifies improvements to ALE-Bench competitive
programming solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert load balancing
loss functions that illuminate the space of optimization strategies. Our
results demonstrate that ShinkaEvolve achieves broad applicability with
exceptional sample efficiency. By providing open-source accessibility and
cost-efficiency, this work democratizes open-ended discovery across diverse
computational problems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TriSPrompt的分层软提示模型，用于解决多模态谣言检测中普遍存在的模态缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态谣言检测方法主要集中于从完整的多模态训练数据中学习联合模态表示，这使得它们在解决现实场景中常见的模态缺失问题时效果不佳。

Method: 该模型集成了三种类型的提示，即模态感知（MA）提示、模态缺失（MM）提示和互视图（MV）提示，以有效检测不完整多模态数据中的谣言。MA提示捕获来自特定模态的异构信息和来自可用数据的同构特征，有助于模态恢复。MM提示模拟不完整数据中的缺失状态，增强模型对缺失信息的适应性。MV提示学习主观（即文本和图像）和客观（即评论）视角之间的关系，有效检测谣言。

Result: 在三个真实基准数据集上的大量实验表明，与最先进的方法相比，TriSPrompt的准确率提高了13%以上。

Conclusion: TriSPrompt模型在不完整多模态谣言检测任务上表现出色，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The widespread presence of incomplete modalities in multimodal data poses a
significant challenge to achieving accurate rumor detection. Existing
multimodal rumor detection methods primarily focus on learning joint modality
representations from \emph{complete} multimodal training data, rendering them
ineffective in addressing the common occurrence of \emph{missing modalities} in
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical soft prompt
model \textsf{TriSPrompt}, which integrates three types of prompts,
\textit{i.e.}, \emph{modality-aware} (MA) prompt, \emph{modality-missing} (MM)
prompt, and \emph{mutual-views} (MV) prompt, to effectively detect rumors in
incomplete multimodal data. The MA prompt captures both heterogeneous
information from specific modalities and homogeneous features from available
data, aiding in modality recovery. The MM prompt models missing states in
incomplete data, enhancing the model's adaptability to missing information. The
MV prompt learns relationships between subjective (\textit{i.e.}, text and
image) and objective (\textit{i.e.}, comments) perspectives, effectively
detecting rumors. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks
demonstrate that \textsf{TriSPrompt} achieves an accuracy gain of over 13\%
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The codes and datasets are available at

TL;DR: RoadMind is a self-supervised framework that enhances the geospatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs using structured data from OpenStreetMap (OSM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs remain limited in their ability to reason about geospatial data, particularly road networks, distances, and directions. This gap poses challenges in disaster scenarios.

Method: The automated pipeline extracts road infrastructure data for a given city and converts it into multiple supervision formats tailored to key spatial tasks. We pretrain and fine-tune LLMs on these representations using QLoRA adapters and 4-bit quantized models.

Result: Models trained via RoadMind significantly outperform strong baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs equipped with advanced prompt engineering.

Conclusion: This demonstrates the potential of structured geospatial data to enhance language models with robust spatial reasoning, enabling more effective offline AI systems for disaster response.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a range
of natural language tasks, but remain limited in their ability to reason about
geospatial data, particularly road networks, distances, and directions. This
gap poses challenges in disaster scenarios, where spatial understanding is
critical for tasks such as evacuation planning and resource allocation. In this
work, we present RoadMind, a self-supervised framework that enhances the
geospatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs using structured data from
OpenStreetMap (OSM). Our automated pipeline extracts road infrastructure data
for a given city and converts it into multiple supervision formats tailored to
key spatial tasks. We pretrain and fine-tune LLMs on these representations
using QLoRA adapters and 4-bit quantized models. We evaluate our approach on
three disaster-prone cities with varying global representation, Los Angeles,
Christchurch, and Manila, across tasks such as road segment identification,
nearest road retrieval, and distance/direction estimation. Our results show
that models trained via RoadMind significantly outperform strong baselines,
including state-of-the-art LLMs equipped with advanced prompt engineering. This
demonstrates the potential of structured geospatial data to enhance language
models with robust spatial reasoning, enabling more effective offline AI
systems for disaster response.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种评估大型语言模型（LLM）在个性化设置中鲁棒性的框架PERG。该框架关注模型在满足用户偏好的同时保持事实准确性的能力。研究发现，现有LLM在鲁棒个性化方面存在不足，并提出了一种名为Pref-Aligner的两阶段方法来提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注回应是否符合用户偏好，但忽略了事实性。在个性化背景下，模型需要既保证事实准确，又符合用户偏好。

Method: 提出了PERG框架和一个新的数据集PERGData，用于评估LLM的鲁棒性。评估了来自五个不同模型家族的十四个模型，并采用了不同的提示方法。还提出了Pref-Aligner，一种两阶段方法，旨在提高鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现，即使是最强的模型（GPT-4.1、LLaMA3-70B）在没有个性化的情况下，也会在5%的先前成功案例中未能保持正确性，而较小的模型（例如，7B规模）可能会失败超过20%的时间。Pref-Aligner可以将鲁棒性平均提高25%。

Conclusion: 目前评估实践存在关键差距，需要引入工具和指标来支持更可靠、用户对齐的LLM部署。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in personalizing the responses
of large language models (LLMs). While existing evaluations primarily focus on
whether a response aligns with a user's preferences, we argue that factuality
is an equally important yet often overlooked dimension. In the context of
personalization, we define a model as robust if its responses are both
factually accurate and align with the user preferences. To assess this, we
introduce PERG, a scalable framework for evaluating robustness in LLMs, along
with a new dataset, PERGData. We evaluate fourteen models from five different
model families using different prompting methods. Our findings show that
current LLMs struggle with robust personalization: even the strongest models
(GPT-4.1, LLaMA3-70B) fail to maintain correctness in 5% of previously
successful cases without personalization, while smaller models (e.g., 7B-scale)
can fail more than 20% of the time. Further analysis reveals that robustness is
significantly affected by the nature of the query and the type of user
preference. To mitigate these failures, we propose Pref-Aligner, a two-stage
approach that improves robustness by an average of 25% across models. Our work
highlights critical gaps in current evaluation practices and introduces tools
and metrics to support more reliable, user-aligned LLM deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的攻击对齐的大语言模型的方法，称为语义表示攻击，该方法通过利用语义表示空间来生成对抗性prompt，从而绕过LLM的防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常针对精确的肯定性回答，存在收敛性有限、prompt不自然和计算成本高等问题。

Method: 提出了语义表示启发式搜索算法，通过在增量扩展期间保持可解释性，有效地生成语义连贯且简洁的对抗性prompt。

Result: 该方法在18个LLM上实现了前所未有的攻击成功率（平均89.41%，其中11个模型上达到100%），同时保持了隐蔽性和效率。

Conclusion: 实验结果证实了语义表示攻击的优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly employ alignment techniques to
prevent harmful outputs. Despite these safeguards, attackers can circumvent
them by crafting prompts that induce LLMs to generate harmful content.
  Current methods typically target exact affirmative responses, such as ``Sure,
here is...'', suffering from limited convergence, unnatural prompts, and high
computational costs.
  We introduce Semantic Representation Attack, a novel paradigm that
fundamentally reconceptualizes adversarial objectives against aligned LLMs.
  Rather than targeting exact textual patterns, our approach exploits the
semantic representation space comprising diverse responses with equivalent
harmful meanings.
  This innovation resolves the inherent trade-off between attack efficacy and
prompt naturalness that plagues existing methods.
  The Semantic Representation Heuristic Search algorithm is proposed to
efficiently generate semantically coherent and concise adversarial prompts by
maintaining interpretability during incremental expansion.
  We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for semantic convergence and
demonstrate that our method achieves unprecedented attack success rates
(89.41\% averaged across 18 LLMs, including 100\% on 11 models) while
maintaining stealthiness and efficiency.
  Comprehensive experimental results confirm the overall superiority of our
Semantic Representation Attack.
  The code will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 离线评估无法捕捉到语言模型在实际应用中的行为，因为个性化会根本上改变模型的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准离线评估无法捕捉到个性化对语言模型行为的影响。

Method: 通过比较离线评估和实际用户在ChatGPT和Gemini上的在线评估来验证。

Result: 经验证据表明，相同的基准问题在不同的用户聊天会话中会产生明显不同的响应。

Conclusion: 个性化会显著影响语言模型的行为，离线评估不足以评估实际应用中的模型性能。

Abstract: Standard offline evaluations for language models -- a series of independent,
state-less inferences made by models -- fail to capture how language models
actually behave in practice, where personalization fundamentally alters model
behavior. For instance, identical benchmark questions to the same language
model can produce markedly different responses when prompted to a state-less
system, in one user's chat session, or in a different user's chat session. In
this work, we provide empirical evidence showcasing this phenomenon by
comparing offline evaluations to field evaluations conducted by having 800 real
users of ChatGPT and Gemini pose benchmark and other provided questions to
their chat interfaces.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合 BERTopic 和大型语言模型的主题建模框架，以解决社交媒体数据中 BERTopic 的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERTopic 在处理社交媒体数据时效果不佳，现有的大型语言模型方法计算开销大。

Method: 结合 BERTopic 生成主题，然后使用大型语言模型进行主题归约，迭代地识别和合并语义相似的主题。

Result: 在 Twitter/X 数据集上评估，该方法在提高主题多样性方面优于基线方法，并在许多情况下提高了连贯性。

Conclusion: 该方法在主题多样性和连贯性方面有提升，但对数据集特征和初始参数选择敏感。

Abstract: The BERTopic framework leverages transformer embeddings and hierarchical
clustering to extract latent topics from unstructured text corpora. While
effective, it often struggles with social media data, which tends to be noisy
and sparse, resulting in an excessive number of overlapping topics. Recent work
explored the use of large language models for end-to-end topic modelling.
However, these approaches typically require significant computational overhead,
limiting their scalability in big data contexts. In this work, we propose a
framework that combines BERTopic for topic generation with large language
models for topic reduction. The method first generates an initial set of topics
and constructs a representation for each. These representations are then
provided as input to the language model, which iteratively identifies and
merges semantically similar topics. We evaluate the approach across three
Twitter/X datasets and four different language models. Our method outperforms
the baseline approach in enhancing topic diversity and, in many cases,
coherence, with some sensitivity to dataset characteristics and initial
parameter selection.

*Ruanjun Li,Ziheng Liu,Yuanming Shi,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的pipeline-parallel self-speculative decoding (PPSD) 方法，旨在提高大型语言模型 (LLM) 的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的early-exit based self-speculative decoding (EESD)方法在实践中难以达到预期的加速效果，因为只有当大部分draft tokens被接受时，EESD才能发挥作用。否则，draft成本可能会超过加速增益，导致负加速。

Method: 通过将模型层配置为流水线，使early-exit (draft) 计算和remaining-layer (verification) 计算重叠，并交错drafting和verification过程。在LLM验证当前token时，early-exit路径同时draft下一个token。

Result: 在不同的benchmark上，PPSD实现了2.01x~3.81x的加速比。

Conclusion: PPSD在提供高效的self-speculation方面取得了显著进展，实现了接近最佳的加速效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive generation quality, but incur
very high inference cost because each output token is generated
auto-regressively through all model layers. Early-exit based self-speculative
decoding (EESD) has emerged to mitigate this cost. However, in practice, many
approaches struggle to achieve the expected acceleration in such
draft-then-verify paradigm even with a well-aligned early-exit head and
selected exit position. Our analysis reveals that EESD only pays off when the
vast majority of draft tokens are accepted by the LLM. Otherwise, the draft
cost may overcome the acceleration gain and lead to a negative speedup. To
mitigate this, we propose Pipeline-Parallel Self-Speculative Decoding (PPSD)
that fully pipelines the draft and verification work so that no effort is
wasted on failed predictions. It has two key innovations. We configure the
model layers as a pipeline in which early-exit (draft) computations and
remaining-layer (verification) computations overlap. We interleave drafting and
verification per token. While the LLM is verifying the current token in its
final layers, the early-exit path simultaneously drafts the next token. Such a
verify-while-draft scheme keeps all units busy and validates tokens on-the-fly
analogous to pipelining the speculation and verification stages. Empirical
results confirm that PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration in
self-speculative LLM inference. On diverse benchmarks, PPSD achieves speedup
ratios in the range of 2.01x~3.81x, which gains almost the optimal acceleration
at the fixed acceptance rate and exit position, showcasing its advancement in
providing efficient self-speculation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于小型语言模型 (SLM) 的代理架构 P-C-G，专门为韩语工具使用而优化。P-C-G 通过角色分离规划、调用和生成：规划器生成初始批处理计划，调用器在联合模式-值验证后返回标准化的调用对象，生成器集成工具输出以生成最终答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在韩国环境中，频繁的韩英代码切换会导致执行失败，因此本文应用了“韩语优先”的值策略。

Method: 该方法通过角色分离规划、调用和生成，构建了一个小型语言模型代理架构 P-C-G，并应用韩语优先的值策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，P-C-G 在降低 tokens 数量和保持可接受的延迟的同时，提供了具有竞争力的工具使用准确性和端到端质量。

Conclusion: 角色专业化的 SLM 是韩语工具使用代理的一种经济高效的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose a small-scale language model (SLM) based agent architecture,
Planner-Caller-Generator (P-C-G), optimized for Korean tool use. P-C-G
separates planning, calling, and generation by role: the Planner produces an
initial batch plan with limited on-demand replanning; the Caller returns a
normalized call object after joint schema-value validation; and the Generator
integrates tool outputs to produce the final answer. We apply a Korean-first
value policy to reduce execution failures caused by frequent Korean-to-English
code switching in Korean settings. Evaluation assumes Korean queries and Korean
tool/parameter specifications; it covers single-chain, multi-chain,
missing-parameters, and missing-functions scenarios, and is conducted via an
LLM-as-a-Judge protocol averaged over five runs under a unified I/O interface.
Results show that P-C-G delivers competitive tool-use accuracy and end-to-end
quality while reducing tokens and maintaining acceptable latency, indicating
that role-specialized SLMs are a cost-effective alternative for Korean tool-use
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill dimensions.

Method: Categorizing problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate specific abilities.

Result: Derived the skill profile of GPT-5-thinking, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its differences relative to o4-mini-high.

Conclusion: The value of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation is underscored.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{GAUSS} (\textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}ssessment of
\textbf{U}nderlying \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{S}kills in Mathematics), a
benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill
dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem
solving and communication, and meta-skills and creativity. By categorizing
problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate
specific abilities, GAUSS constructs comprehensive, fine-grained, and
interpretable profiles of models' mathematical abilities. These profiles
faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify
how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of
\textsc{GPT-5-thinking}, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its
differences relative to \textsc{o4-mini-high}, thereby underscoring the value
of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation.

### [30] [Meow: End-to-End Outline Writing for Automatic Academic Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19370)
*Zhaoyu Ma,Yuan Shan,Jiahao Zhao,Nan Xu,Lei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Meow的元数据驱动的outline写作框架，用于生成有组织的、准确的outline。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动综述方法缺乏对综述主题的深入理解和细粒度的风格。

Method: 将outline写作定义为一个端到端的任务，从论文元数据生成分层结构化的outline；整理来自arXiv、bioRxiv和medRxiv的高质量综述数据集；采用结合监督微调和强化学习的两阶段训练方法。

Result: 8B推理模型表现出强大的性能，具有很高的结构保真度和风格连贯性。

Conclusion: Meow框架能够有效地生成高质量的论文outline。

Abstract: As academic paper publication numbers grow exponentially, conducting in-depth
surveys with LLMs automatically has become an inevitable trend. Outline
writing, which aims to systematically organize related works, is critical for
automated survey generation. Yet existing automatic survey methods treat
outline writing as mere workflow steps in the overall pipeline. Such
template-based workflows produce outlines that lack in-depth understanding of
the survey topic and fine-grained styles. To address these limitations, we
propose Meow, the first metadata-driven outline writing framework that produces
organized and faithful outlines efficiently. Specifically, we first formulate
outline writing as an end-to-end task that generates hierarchical structured
outlines from paper metadata. We then curate a high-quality dataset of surveys
from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv, and establish systematic evaluation metrics
for outline quality assessment. Finally, we employ a two-stage training
approach combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our 8B
reasoning model demonstrates strong performance with high structural fidelity
and stylistic coherence.

*Kangtao Lv,Haibin Chen,Yujin Yuan,Langming Liu,Shilei Liu,Yongwei Wang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在预训练过程中注入领域知识的问题，发现过量注入会导致灾难性遗忘，并提出了一个知识注入比例定律，用于预测最佳的领域知识注入量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在没有领域特定优化的情况下，在专业知识基准测试中表现不佳，甚至产生幻觉。为了提高下游性能，需要在预训练过程中注入领域知识。然而，注入过少导致专业化不足，注入过多则会导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 通过系统实验，观察到模型存在知识保留能力急剧下降的临界崩溃点，并且这些崩溃点与模型的大小相关。基于这些观察，提出了知识注入比例定律。

Result: 实验验证了该比例定律的有效性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个知识注入比例定律，可以预测注入大型LLM的最佳领域知识量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention due to
their impressive general capabilities across diverse downstream tasks. However,
without domain-specific optimization, they often underperform on specialized
knowledge benchmarks and even produce hallucination. Recent studies show that
strategically infusing domain knowledge during pretraining can substantially
improve downstream performance. A critical challenge lies in balancing this
infusion trade-off: injecting too little domain-specific data yields
insufficient specialization, whereas excessive infusion triggers catastrophic
forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. In this work, we focus on the
phenomenon of memory collapse induced by over-infusion. Through systematic
experiments, we make two key observations, i.e. 1) Critical collapse point:
each model exhibits a threshold beyond which its knowledge retention
capabilities sharply degrade. 2) Scale correlation: these collapse points scale
consistently with the model's size. Building on these insights, we propose a
knowledge infusion scaling law that predicts the optimal amount of domain
knowledge to inject into large LLMs by analyzing their smaller counterparts.
Extensive experiments across different model sizes and pertaining token budgets
validate both the effectiveness and generalizability of our scaling law.

### [32] [A Pipeline to Assess Merging Methods via Behavior and Internals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19476)
*Yutaro Sigris,Andreas Waldis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了合并多个语言模型的方法，旨在利用它们的能力，例如领域自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要从行为角度研究合并模型，本文则通过评估和连接它们的行为和内部结构，提供了第一个全面的视角。

Method: 本文提出了一个新颖的评估流程，首先合并多个父语言模型，然后根据下游任务（如MMLU）的行为以及内部编码的语言能力，评估合并后的模型与初始模型。

Result: 结果表明，合并方法对行为和内部结构的影响不同。虽然合并模型的性能通常介于两个父模型之间，但它们编码的关于语言现象的信息，特别是在形态学和句法方面，可以超过父模型。此外，我们发现这种行为和内部评估之间的排序相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 通过我们的流程和初步结果，我们强调需要对模型合并方法进行更全面的评估，以获得对其能力和可靠性的真实理解，而不仅仅是潜在的表面行为进展。

Abstract: Merging methods combine the weights of multiple language models (LMs) to
leverage their capacities, such as for domain adaptation. While existing
studies investigate merged models from a solely behavioral perspective, we
offer the first comprehensive view by assessing and connecting their behavior
and internals. We present a novel evaluation pipeline that first merges
multiple parent LMs, and then evaluates the merged models in comparison to the
initial ones based on their behavior on downstream tasks, like MMLU, and the
internal encoded linguistic competence. We showcase this pipeline by assessing
the merging of instruction fine-tuned with math- and code-adapted LMs from the
Qwen2.5 family. Our results show that merging methods impacts behavior and
internals differently. While the performance of merged models is typically
between that of the two parent models, their encoded information about
linguistic phenomena, particularly in morphology and syntax, can surpass the
parent models. Moreover, we find weak ranking correlation between this behavior
and internal evaluation. With our pipeline and initial results, we emphasize
the need for more comprehensive evaluations of model merging methods to gain a
faithful understanding of their capabilities and reliability, beyond potential
superficial behavioral advances.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型能够有效地进行框架识别，即使没有明确的监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否编码了框架语义的潜在知识，重点是框架识别。

Method: 使用FrameNet词汇资源，在基于prompt的推理下评估模型。

Result: 模型即使没有明确的监督也能有效地进行框架识别。在FrameNet数据上对模型进行微调，可以显著提高领域内准确率，同时很好地推广到领域外基准。

Conclusion: 这些模型可以生成语义连贯的框架定义，突出了模型对框架语义的内在理解。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models encode latent knowledge of frame
semantics, focusing on frame identification, a core challenge in frame semantic
parsing that involves selecting the appropriate semantic frame for a target
word in context. Using the FrameNet lexical resource, we evaluate models under
prompt-based inference and observe that they can perform frame identification
effectively even without explicit supervision. To assess the impact of
task-specific training, we fine-tune the model on FrameNet data, which
substantially improves in-domain accuracy while generalizing well to
out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that the models can generate
semantically coherent frame definitions, highlighting the model's internalized
understanding of frame semantics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了比较实体匹配任务的基线RoBERTa置信度与使用温度缩放、蒙特卡罗Dropout和Ensembles校准的置信度，进行了一项实证研究。

Method: 使用Abt-Buy、DBLP-ACM、iTunes-Amazon和Company数据集。

Result: 提出的修改后的RoBERTa模型表现出轻微的过度自信，在数据集上的预期校准误差分数范围为0.0043到0.0552。使用温度缩放可以减轻这种过度自信，将预期校准误差分数降低高达23.83%。

Conclusion: 温度缩放可以减轻RoBERTa模型的过度自信。

Abstract: This research aims to explore the intersection of Large Language Models and
confidence calibration in Entity Matching. To this end, we perform an empirical
study to compare baseline RoBERTa confidences for an Entity Matching task
against confidences that are calibrated using Temperature Scaling, Monte Carlo
Dropout and Ensembles. We use the Abt-Buy, DBLP-ACM, iTunes-Amazon and Company
datasets. The findings indicate that the proposed modified RoBERTa model
exhibits a slight overconfidence, with Expected Calibration Error scores
ranging from 0.0043 to 0.0552 across datasets. We find that this overconfidence
can be mitigated using Temperature Scaling, reducing Expected Calibration Error
scores by up to 23.83%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于像素的语言模型旨在解决语言建模中的词汇瓶颈问题，但仍然存在不确定性量化的问题。

Method: 通过蒙特卡洛Dropout、Transformer注意力机制和集成学习等方法，在18种语言和7种文字的3个语义挑战性任务中分析基于像素的语言模型的不确定性和置信度。

Result: 结果表明，基于像素的模型在重建patches时低估了不确定性。不确定性也受到文字的影响，拉丁语系的不确定性较低。集成学习的发现表明，在跨16种语言的命名实体识别和问答任务中应用超参数调整时，性能更好。

Conclusion: 论文分析了基于像素的语言模型中的不确定性量化问题，发现模型低估了不确定性，并受到文字的影响，且集成学习可以通过超参数调整提高性能。

Abstract: Pixel-based language models aim to solve the vocabulary bottleneck problem in
language modeling, but the challenge of uncertainty quantification remains
open. The novelty of this work consists of analysing uncertainty and confidence
in pixel-based language models across 18 languages and 7 scripts, all part of 3
semantically challenging tasks. This is achieved through several methods such
as Monte Carlo Dropout, Transformer Attention, and Ensemble Learning. The
results suggest that pixel-based models underestimate uncertainty when
reconstructing patches. The uncertainty is also influenced by the script, with
Latin languages displaying lower uncertainty. The findings on ensemble learning
show better performance when applying hyperparameter tuning during the named
entity recognition and question-answering tasks across 16 languages.

Motivation: 确定正确的上下文仍然是一个开放的挑战。本文提出了一种有效的基于嵌入的检索方法，用于ASR中的自动上下文发现。

Method: 提出了基于嵌入的检索方法，并与基于大型语言模型（LLM）的上下文生成和使用LLM的识别后转录校正进行了比较。

Result: 在TED-LIUMv3、Earnings21和SPGISpeech上的实验表明，相对于不使用上下文，该方法可将WER降低高达17%（百分比差异），而oracle上下文可降低高达24.1%。

Conclusion: 该研究表明检索增强生成是提高 ASR 系统转录准确性的有效策略。

Abstract: This work investigates retrieval augmented generation as an efficient
strategy for automatic context discovery in context-aware Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) system, in order to improve transcription accuracy in the
presence of rare or out-of-vocabulary terms. However, identifying the right
context automatically remains an open challenge. This work proposes an
efficient embedding-based retrieval approach for automatic context discovery in
ASR. To contextualize its effectiveness, two alternatives based on large
language models (LLMs) are also evaluated: (1) large language model (LLM)-based
context generation via prompting, and (2) post-recognition transcript
correction using LLMs. Experiments on the TED-LIUMv3, Earnings21 and SPGISpeech
demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces WER by up to 17% (percentage
difference) relative to using no-context, while the oracle context results in a
reduction of up to 24.1%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的transformer模型的位置嵌入方法，名为“精确位置嵌入”（ExPE），它是一种绝对位置嵌入方法，可以外推到比训练序列更长的序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer模型依赖于绝对或相对位置嵌入将位置信息纳入token嵌入，但通常难以推广到比训练期间看到的序列更长的序列。

Method: 该方法利用一种新的嵌入策略，通过覆盖嵌入向量的特定维度来编码精确的位置信息，从而实现更精确的token位置表示。

Result: 在因果语言建模中，当在比训练中使用的序列更长的序列上进行测试时，与旋转和正弦嵌入相比，ExPE嵌入显著降低了困惑度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅保持了原始嵌入的完整性，而且增强了模型推广到更长序列的能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to position embeddings in transformer
models, named "Exact Positional Embeddings" (ExPE). An absolute positional
embedding method that can extrapolate to sequences of lengths longer than the
ones it was trained on. Traditional transformer models rely on absolute or
relative position embeddings to incorporate positional information into token
embeddings, which often struggle with extrapolation to sequences longer than
those seen during training. Our proposed method utilizes a novel embedding
strategy that encodes exact positional information by overriding specific
dimensions of the embedding vectors, thereby enabling a more precise
representation of token positions. The proposed approach not only maintains the
integrity of the original embeddings but also enhances the model's ability to
generalize to more extended sequences. In causal language modeling, our ExPE
embeddings significantly reduce perplexity compared to rotary and sinusoidal
embeddings, when tested on sequences longer than those used in training.

Abstract: Cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques keep reshaping our view
of the world. For example, Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications such
as ChatGPT have shown the capability of generating human-like conversation on
extensive topics. Due to the impressive performance on a variety of
language-related tasks (e.g., open-domain question answering, translation, and
document summarization), one can envision the far-reaching impacts that can be
brought by the LLMs with broader real-world applications (e.g., customer
service, education and accessibility, and scientific discovery). Inspired by
their success, this paper will offer an overview of state-of-the-art LLMs and
their integration into a wide range of academic disciplines, including: (1)
arts, letters, and law (e.g., history, philosophy, political science, arts and
architecture, law), (2) economics and business (e.g., finance, economics,
accounting, marketing), and (3) science and engineering (e.g., mathematics,
physics and mechanical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, life
sciences and bioengineering, earth sciences and civil engineering, computer
science and electrical engineering). Integrating humanity and technology, in
this paper, we will explore how LLMs are shaping research and practice in these
fields, while also discussing key limitations, open challenges, and future
directions in the era of generative AI. The review of how LLMs are engaged
across disciplines-along with key observations and insights-can help
researchers and practitioners interested in exploiting LLMs to advance their

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为 GuessingGame 的协议，用于评估大型语言模型在开放域环境中作为策略性问题提出者的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在开放域环境中提出高质量问题的能力，并探究如何提高提问质量。

Method: Guesser LLM 通过向 Oracle 提出自由形式的问题来识别隐藏对象，并提出了两种信息增益（IG）指标来衡量问题质量：基于贝叶斯的方法和基于熵的方法。

Result: 更高的 IG 强烈预测效率：一个标准差的 IG 增加将预期游戏长度减少 43%。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型中的问题提出是可衡量和可改进的，并且对于交互式推理至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce GuessingGame, a protocol for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) as strategic question-askers in open-ended, open-domain settings. A
Guesser LLM identifies a hidden object by posing free-form questions to an
Oracle without predefined choices or candidate lists. To measure question
quality, we propose two information gain (IG) metrics: a Bayesian method that
tracks belief updates over semantic concepts using LLM-scored relevance, and an
entropy-based method that filters candidates via ConceptNet. Both metrics are
model-agnostic and support post hoc analysis. Across 858 games with multiple
models and prompting strategies, higher IG strongly predicts efficiency: a
one-standard-deviation IG increase reduces expected game length by 43\%.
Prompting constraints guided by IG, such as enforcing question diversity,
enable weaker models to significantly improve performance. These results show
that question-asking in LLMs is both measurable and improvable, and crucial for
interactive reasoning.

Result: 该框架能够有效识别面部遮挡图像中的具身情感，优于基线模型，且无需任何微调。大型视觉语言模型表现出对面部区域的持续偏见。

Conclusion: ELENA为跨视觉模态的具身情感分析开辟了一条新路径，并丰富了情感感知环境中的建模。

Abstract: The embodiment of emotional reactions from body parts contains rich
information about our affective experiences. We propose a framework that
utilizes state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs) to generate
Embodied LVLM Emotion Narratives (ELENA). These are well-defined, multi-layered
text outputs, primarily comprising descriptions that focus on the salient body
parts involved in emotional reactions. We also employ attention maps and
observe that contemporary models exhibit a persistent bias towards the facial
region. Despite this limitation, we observe that our employed framework can
effectively recognize embodied emotions in face-masked images, outperforming
baselines without any fine-tuning. ELENA opens a new trajectory for embodied
emotion analysis across the modality of vision and enriches modeling in an
affect-aware setting.

Abstract: Our ability to efficiently and accurately evaluate the quality of machine

unsupervised method to generate training data for translation evaluation over
different document lengths and application domains by repeated rounds of
translation between source and target languages. We evaluate evaluation systems
trained on texts mechanically generated using both model rotation and language
translation approaches, demonstrating improved performance over a popular
translation evaluation system (xCOMET) on two different tasks: (i) scoring the
quality of a given translation against a human reference and (ii) selecting
which of two translations is generationally closer to an original source

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为AutoSpec的安全agentic框架，用于自动起草专利规范，实验结果表明AutoSpec在专利起草任务上优于现有的基线。

Abstract: Patents play a critical role in driving technological innovation by granting
inventors exclusive rights to their inventions. However the process of drafting
a patent application is often expensive and time-consuming, making it a prime
candidate for automation. Despite recent advancements in language models,
several challenges hinder the development of robust automated patent drafting
systems. First, the information within a patent application is highly
confidential, which often prevents the use of closed-source LLMs for automating
this task. Second, the process of drafting a patent application is difficult
for even the most advanced language models due to their long context, technical
writing style, and specialized domain knowledge. To address these challenges,
we introduce AutoSpec, a secure, agentic framework for Automatically drafting
patent Specification. Our approach decomposes the drafting process into a
sequence of manageable subtasks, each solvable by smaller, open-source language
models enhanced with custom tools tailored for drafting patent specification.
To assess our system, we design a novel evaluation protocol in collaboration
with experienced patent attorneys. Our automatic and expert evaluations show
that AutoSpec outperforms existing baselines on a patent drafting task.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了模型性能和计算效率之间的关键权衡，为在现实世界的行人安全系统中部署LLM提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Pedestrian safety is a critical component of urban mobility and is strongly
influenced by the interactions between pedestrian decision-making and driver
yielding behavior at crosswalks. Modeling driver--pedestrian interactions at
intersections requires accurately capturing the complexity of these behaviors.
Traditional machine learning models often struggle to capture the nuanced and
context-dependent reasoning required for these multifactorial interactions, due
to their reliance on fixed feature representations and limited
interpretability. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) are suited for
extracting patterns from heterogeneous traffic data, enabling accurate modeling
of driver-pedestrian interactions. Therefore, this paper leverages multimodal
LLMs through a novel prompt design that incorporates domain-specific knowledge,
structured reasoning, and few-shot prompting, enabling interpretable and
context-aware inference of driver yielding behavior, as an example application
of modeling pedestrian--driver interaction. We benchmarked state-of-the-art
LLMs against traditional classifiers, finding that GPT-4o consistently achieves
the highest accuracy and recall, while Deepseek-V3 excels in precision. These
findings highlight the critical trade-offs between model performance and
computational efficiency, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in
real-world pedestrian safety systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过模型合并在LLM中进行个性化调整的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足对个性化AI系统的需求，人们越来越有兴趣使大型语言模型（LLM）的行为与诸如个性之类的人类特征保持一致。先前在LLM中诱导个性的尝试已显示出可喜的结果，但是它们难以捕获人类特征的连续性和多维性。

Method: 通过从在给定个性特征上微调的模型的权重中减去预训练模型的权重来构建个性向量。通过合并个性向量，我们使LLM能够表现出所需的个性特征，而无需进行额外的训练。

Result: 大量的实验表明，个性向量可以实现对特质强度的连续控制，并支持多种特质的组合。

Conclusion: 个性向量可在各种下游模型之间转移，这表明它们编码了个性的通用表示。

Abstract: Driven by the demand for personalized AI systems, there is growing interest
in aligning the behavior of large language models (LLMs) with human traits such
as personality. Previous attempts to induce personality in LLMs have shown
promising results, but they struggle to capture the continuous and
multidimensional nature of human traits. In this work, we propose a novel
method for personality modulation in LLMs via model merging. Specifically, we
construct personality vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model
from those of the fine-tuned model on a given personality trait. By merging
personality vectors, we enable LLMs to exhibit desired personality traits
without additional training. Extensive experiments show that personality
vectors enable continuous control over trait intensity and support the
composition of multiple traits. Furthermore, personality vectors transfer
across diverse downstream models, suggesting that they encode generalizable
representations of personality. Our code is available at here.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PART的多阶段多任务框架，用于对齐语音和文本表示，尤其是在多语言环境中，通过分离语言内部和跨语言的对齐，并动态激活LLM参数，最终在多个数据集上超越了传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大模型在多语言环境下对齐语音和文本表示时面临挑战，传统方法冻结LLM参数并训练编码器，限制了性能。

Method: 提出了渐进对齐表示训练（PART）框架，该框架采用多阶段和多任务方法，分离语言内部和跨语言的对齐，并在跨语言训练期间动态激活LLM参数，后续引入基于文本的任务以增强多语言理解。

Result: 在CommonVoice 15、Fleurs、Wenetspeech和CoVoST2数据集上的实验表明，PART超越了传统方法。

Conclusion: PART在多语言语音模态对齐方面具有有效性和通用性，能够平衡特定语言的区分和跨语言的泛化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have expanded from text to speech, giving rise
to Speech Large Models (SLMs) that support recognition, translation, and
synthesis. A key challenge is aligning speech and text representations, which
becomes harder in multilingual settings. Existing methods often freeze LLM
parameters and train encoders on multilingual data, but this forces
cross-language convergence and limits performance. We introduce Progressive
Alignment Representation Training (PART), a multi-stage and multi-task
framework that separates within-language from cross-language alignment. During
cross-language training, LLM parameters are dynamically activated, and
text-based tasks are later introduced to enhance multilingual understanding.
Experiments on CommonVoice 15, Fleurs, Wenetspeech, and CoVoST2 show that PART
surpasses conventional approaches, with analysis confirming its ability to
balance language-specific distinctions and cross-language generalization. These
results demonstrate PART's effectiveness and generality for multilingual speech
modality alignment.

*Sina J. Semnani,Han Zhang,Xinyan He,Merve Tekgürler,Monica S. Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CHURRO is a VLM for historical text recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs are not equipped to read the diverse and degraded texts in historical documents.

Method: A 3B-parameter VLM is trained on CHURRO-DS, a large historical text recognition dataset.

Result: CHURRO outperforms other VLMs and OCR systems on CHURRO-DS, achieving 82.3% (printed) and 70.1% (handwritten) normalized Levenshtein similarity.

Conclusion: The release of the model and dataset aims to enable community-driven research to improve the readability of historical texts.

Abstract: Accurate text recognition for historical documents can greatly advance the
study and preservation of cultural heritage. Existing vision-language models
(VLMs), however, are designed for modern, standardized texts and are not
equipped to read the diverse languages and scripts, irregular layouts, and
frequent degradation found in historical materials.
  This paper presents CHURRO, a 3B-parameter open-weight VLM specialized for
historical text recognition. The model is trained on CHURRO-DS, the largest
historical text recognition dataset to date. CHURRO-DS unifies 155 historical
corpora comprising 99,491 pages, spanning 22 centuries of textual heritage
across 46 language clusters, including historical variants and dead languages.
  We evaluate several open-weight and closed VLMs and optical character
recognition (OCR) systems on CHURRO-DS and find that CHURRO outperforms all
other VLMs. On the CHURRO-DS test set, CHURRO achieves 82.3% (printed) and
70.1% (handwritten) normalized Levenshtein similarity, surpassing the
second-best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, by 1.4% and 6.5%, respectively, while being
15.5 times more cost-effective.
  By releasing the model and dataset, we aim to enable community-driven
research to improve the readability of historical texts and accelerate
scholarship.

TL;DR: 本研究通过利用大型语言模型(llm)已建立的英语到x的能力的合成数据生成框架，解决了直接非英语(x2x)翻译中性能不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)在以英语为中心的语言对中表现出强大的机器翻译能力，但在直接非英语(x2x)翻译中表现不佳。

Method: 通过将英语平行语料库扩展到全方位数据集，并开发以英语为参考的质量评估代理，我们能够有效地收集高质量的x2x训练数据。结合基于偏好的优化，我们的方法实现了在72个x2x方向上对广泛使用的llm的显著改进，同时推广到增强en2x性能。

Result: 我们的方法实现了在72个x2x方向上对广泛使用的llm的显著改进，同时推广到增强en2x性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明，战略性地利用以英语为中心的优势可以引导llm中全面的多语言翻译能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong machine translation
capabilities for English-centric language pairs but underperform in direct
non-English (x2x) translation. This work addresses this limitation through a
synthetic data generation framework that leverages models' established
English-to-x (en2x) capabilities. By extending English parallel corpora into
omnidirectional datasets and developing an English-referenced quality
evaluation proxy, we enable effective collection of high-quality x2x training
data. Combined with preference-based optimization, our method achieves
significant improvement across 72 x2x directions for widely used LLMs, while
generalizing to enhance en2x performance. The results demonstrate that
strategic exploitation of English-centric strengths can bootstrap comprehensive
multilingual translation capabilities in LLMs. We release codes, datasets, and

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的基于强化学习的框架，名为 bi-GRPO，用于注入越狱后门。该框架通过双向分组相对策略优化，能够可靠地生成带有触发器的有害内容，并在其他情况下保持安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的嵌入越狱触发器的方法存在泛化性差、隐蔽性受损或生成的越狱响应的上下文可用性降低等局限性。

Method: 该方法采用双向分组相对策略优化（bi-GRPO），这是一种专门为越狱后门注入量身定制的基于强化学习的框架。通过使用成对rollout和成对奖励，bi-GRPO 联合优化模型，以可靠地生成带有触发器的有害内容，并在其他情况下保持安全性。

Result: 实验表明，bi-GRPO 实现了卓越的有效性（>99% 的攻击成功率），在非触发场景中保持了隐蔽性，并产生了高度可用且连贯的越狱响应。

Conclusion: bi-GRPO 显著提高了越狱后门攻击的水平。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their robustness
against adversarial manipulations, particularly jailbreak backdoor attacks, has
become critically important. Existing approaches to embedding jailbreak
triggers--such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), model editing, and
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)--each suffer from limitations
including poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual
usability of generated jailbreak responses. To overcome these issues, we
propose bi-GRPO (bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization), a novel
RL-based framework tailored explicitly for jailbreak backdoor injection. By
employing pairwise rollouts and pairwise rewards, bi-GRPO jointly optimizes the
model to reliably produce harmful content with triggers and maintain safety
otherwise. Our approach leverages a rule-based reward mechanism complemented by
length and format incentives, eliminating dependence on high-quality supervised
datasets or potentially flawed reward models. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that bi-GRPO achieves superior effectiveness (>99\% attack success rate),
preserves stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and produces highly usable and
coherent jailbreak responses, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in
jailbreak backdoor attacks.

Method: 提出了SDG极性检测任务，并构建了一个包含原始和合成数据的基准数据集SDG-POD。使用六个最先进的LLM，考虑了零样本和微调配置，进行了全面的评估。

Result: 结果表明，对于当前一代的LLM来说，这项任务仍然具有挑战性。然而，一些微调模型，特别是QWQ-32B，在特定的可持续发展目标上取得了良好的性能。此外，通过合成生成的示例来扩充微调数据集可以提高模型的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了可持续性监测的方法工具包，并为开发高效、高性能的极性检测系统提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally
recognised framework for addressing critical societal, environmental, and
economic challenges. Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP)
and large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the automatic classification
of textual data according to their relevance to specific SDGs. Nevertheless, in
many applications, it is equally important to determine the directionality of
this relevance; that is, to assess whether the described impact is positive,
neutral, or negative. To tackle this challenge, we propose the novel task of
SDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates
progress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such
progress. To support research in this area, we introduce SDG-POD, a benchmark
dataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and
synthetically generated data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using six
state-of-the-art large LLMs, considering both zero-shot and fine-tuned
configurations. Our results suggest that the task remains challenging for the
current generation of LLMs. Nevertheless, some fine-tuned models, particularly
QWQ-32B, achieve good performance, especially on specific Sustainable
Development Goals such as SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure),
SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG-15 (Life on Land).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the fine-tuning dataset with
synthetically generated examples yields improved model performance on this
task. This result highlights the effectiveness of data enrichment techniques in
addressing the challenges of this resource-constrained domain. This work
advances the methodological toolkit for sustainability monitoring and provides
actionable insights into the development of efficient, high-performing polarity
detection systems.

Conclusion: TianHui实现了中医知识的系统保存和可扩展应用。所有资源均已开源。

Abstract: Domain-specific LLMs in TCM face limitations in research settings due to
constrained adaptability, insufficient evaluation datasets, and limited
computational resources. This study presents TianHui, a specialized TCM LLM
built through contextual data integration and domain knowledge fusion. We
constructed a large-scale TCM corpus (0.97GB unsupervised data + 611,312 QA
pairs) and employed a two-stage training strategy with QLoRA, DeepSpeed Stage
2, and Flash Attention 2. Evaluation on 12 benchmarks showed TianHui ranked
top-three in all metrics for six datasets (APQ, TCMCD, HFR, HCCA, DHPE, TLAW)
and achieved top results in the other six (TCMEE, APR, GCPMI, TCMKQA, TCMRC,
ADTG). Optimal configuration was identified as LoRA rank=128, alpha=256,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高词汇变异、歧义引用和长程依赖使得文学文本中的实体识别具有挑战性。

Method: 从《摩诃婆罗多》中提取了包含超过109K个命名实体提及的数据集，这些实体映射到5.5K个唯一实体，并与英文知识库对齐以支持跨语言链接。

Result: 评估表明，当前的共指消解和实体链接模型在全球测试集的背景下表现不佳。

Conclusion: Mahānāma 为推进实体识别提供了一个独特的基准，尤其是在文学领域。

Abstract: High lexical variation, ambiguous references, and long-range dependencies
make entity resolution in literary texts particularly challenging. We present
Mah\={a}n\={a}ma, the first large-scale dataset for end-to-end Entity Discovery
and Linking (EDL) in Sanskrit, a morphologically rich and under-resourced
language. Derived from the Mah\={a}bh\={a}rata, the world's longest epic, the
dataset comprises over 109K named entity mentions mapped to 5.5K unique
entities, and is aligned with an English knowledge base to support
cross-lingual linking. The complex narrative structure of Mah\={a}n\={a}ma,
coupled with extensive name variation and ambiguity, poses significant
challenges to resolution systems. Our evaluation reveals that current
coreference and entity linking models struggle when evaluated on the global
context of the test set. These results highlight the limitations of current
approaches in resolving entities within such complex discourse. Mah\=an\=ama
thus provides a unique benchmark for advancing entity resolution, especially in
literary domains.

*Jinyang Wu,Bin Zhu,Xiandong Zou,Qiquan Zhang,Xu Fang,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了语音大语言模型（Speech LLMs）在对抗性输入下的鲁棒性问题，提出了名为“gaslighting attacks”的攻击方法，旨在通过精心设计的提示来误导、覆盖或扭曲模型的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音大语言模型越来越多地应用于语音应用中，确保其在对抗性输入下的鲁棒性至关重要。现有的对抗攻击研究主要集中在文本和视觉语言模型，而语音交互的独特性带来的认知和感知挑战尚未被充分探索。

Method: 本文构建了五种操纵策略：愤怒、认知破坏、讽刺、暗示和专业否定，以测试模型在不同任务中的鲁棒性。该框架同时捕捉性能下降和行为反应（如道歉和拒绝）。此外，还进行了声学扰动实验以评估多模态鲁棒性。

Result: 在五个语音和多模态LLM上，使用来自五个不同数据集的10,000多个测试样本进行评估，结果显示在五种gaslighting攻击下，平均准确率下降了24.3%，表明模型存在显著的行为脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，需要更具弹性和可信赖的语音人工智能系统。

Abstract: As Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) become increasingly integrated
into voice-based applications, ensuring their robustness against manipulative
or adversarial input becomes critical. Although prior work has studied
adversarial attacks in text-based LLMs and vision-language models, the unique
cognitive and perceptual challenges of speech-based interaction remain
underexplored. In contrast, speech presents inherent ambiguity, continuity, and
perceptual diversity, which make adversarial attacks more difficult to detect.
In this paper, we introduce gaslighting attacks, strategically crafted prompts
designed to mislead, override, or distort model reasoning as a means to
evaluate the vulnerability of Speech LLMs. Specifically, we construct five
manipulation strategies: Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and
Professional Negation, designed to test model robustness across varied tasks.
It is worth noting that our framework captures both performance degradation and
behavioral responses, including unsolicited apologies and refusals, to diagnose
different dimensions of susceptibility. Moreover, acoustic perturbation
experiments are conducted to assess multi-modal robustness. To quantify model
vulnerability, comprehensive evaluation across 5 Speech and multi-modal LLMs on
over 10,000 test samples from 5 diverse datasets reveals an average accuracy
drop of 24.3% under the five gaslighting attacks, indicating significant
behavioral vulnerability. These findings highlight the need for more resilient
and trustworthy speech-based AI systems.

Motivation: 探索在多用户对话中利用 transformer 模型进行抑郁症早期检测，并研究如何通过 LLM 进行会话式心理健康评估。

Method: 任务 2 采用预处理流程和 RoBERTa 等 transformer 模型，任务 1 设计会话策略与 LLM 交互。

Result: 任务 2 排名第 8，但早期预测速度快；任务 1 排名第 1，各项指标表现最佳。

Conclusion: 在抑郁症早期检测中，需要在早期检测速度和分类准确率之间进行权衡。结构化会话设计与 LLM 结合，在心理健康评估中可行且有效。

Abstract: This paper describes the participation of the SINAI-UJA team in the
eRisk@CLEF 2025 lab. Specifically, we addressed two of the proposed tasks: (i)
Task 2: Contextualized Early Detection of Depression, and (ii) Pilot Task:
Conversational Depression Detection via LLMs. Our approach for Task 2 combines
an extensive preprocessing pipeline with the use of several transformer-based
models, such as RoBERTa Base or MentalRoBERTA Large, to capture the contextual
and sequential nature of multi-user conversations. For the Pilot Task, we
designed a set of conversational strategies to interact with LLM-powered
personas, focusing on maximizing information gain within a limited number of
dialogue turns. In Task 2, our system ranked 8th out of 12 participating teams
based on F1 score. However, a deeper analysis revealed that our models were
among the fastest in issuing early predictions, which is a critical factor in
real-world deployment scenarios. This highlights the trade-off between early
detection and classification accuracy, suggesting potential avenues for
optimizing both jointly in future work. In the Pilot Task, we achieved 1st
place out of 5 teams, obtaining the best overall performance across all
evaluation metrics: DCHR, ADODL and ASHR. Our success in this task demonstrates
the effectiveness of structured conversational design when combined with
powerful language models, reinforcing the feasibility of deploying LLMs in
sensitive mental health assessment contexts.

Method: 该论文通过收集瑞士广播电视台和YouTube上的访谈节目和播客音频，经过分割和弱标注，构建了包含约5000小时语音的语料库。该论文还描述了语料库的构建方法，包括自动化标注流程，并提供了方言分布、token计数和分割特征的统计信息。

Result: 该论文构建了一个包含七个主要瑞士德语方言区以及标准德语的、约5000小时的自发语音语料库。

Conclusion: SwissGPC v1.0语料库的构建为瑞士德语的语音研究提供了一个宝贵的资源，尤其是在处理自然、自发对话方面。

Abstract: We present SwissGPC v1.0, the first mid-to-large-scale corpus of spontaneous
Swiss German speech, developed to support research in ASR, TTS, dialect
identification, and related fields. The dataset consists of links to talk shows
and podcasts hosted on Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen and YouTube, which contain
approximately 5400 hours of raw audio. After segmentation and weak annotation,
nearly 5000 hours of speech were retained, covering the seven major Swiss
German dialect regions alongside Standard German. We describe the corpus
construction methodology, including an automated annotation pipeline, and
provide statistics on dialect distribution, token counts, and segmentation
characteristics. Unlike existing Swiss German speech corpora, which primarily
feature controlled speech, this corpus captures natural, spontaneous
conversations, making it a valuable resource for real-world speech
applications.

Conclusion: 提出的方法可以更好地对齐生成和判断能力，为评估任务中的模型选择提供可靠的代理。

Abstract: LLM-as-Judge frameworks are increasingly popular for AI evaluation, yet
research findings on the relationship between models' generation and judgment
abilities remain inconsistent. We investigate this relationship through
systematic dataset- and instance-level analyses across 11 models and 21 diverse
tasks. Despite both capabilities relying on the same underlying knowledge, our
analyses reveal they are only weakly correlated, primarily due to LLMs'
sensitivity to the responses being judged. To address this, we propose a
self-reference-guided evaluation strategy that leverages a model's own answers
as references. This approach significantly strengthens the correlation between
generation and judgment abilities, offering a practical path to align these
skills and providing a reliable proxy for model selection in evaluation tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Future Policy Aware (FPA) 的偏好学习方法，用于解决大型语言模型 (LLM) 在数学推理中，直接偏好优化 (DPO) 等方法效果不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好学习方法在数学推理中效果不佳，因为 preferred 和 dispreferred trajectories 之间存在大量 token 重叠，降低 dispreferred trajectories 的概率也会降低共享的有用 token 的概率，导致过度惩罚和整体性能崩溃。

Method: 用 future policy 替换 regularization term 中的 current policy，future policy 通过从 reference model 向 current model 的 logit-space extrapolation 估计得出。这实现了更安全的训练，通过抢先 regularize 可能有问题的梯度。

Result: 在 MATH 和 GSM8K 基准测试中，FPA 在 DPO、RPO 和 SimPER 上都产生了一致的性能提升，SimPER 的提升最大，达到 5.75%。

Conclusion: FPA 提供了主动的 regularization，同时保留了共享的有用数学 token 的概率，并实现了更长的、无降级的训练，且计算开销可忽略不计。

Abstract: Preference learning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have
become standard for Large Language Model (LLM) post-training, yet they are
often ineffective for mathematical reasoning. A key challenge is the large
token overlap between preferred and dispreferred trajectories; lowering the
probability of dispreferred trajectories also reduces the probability of shared
useful tokens, leading to over-penalization and overall performance collapse.
As a mitigation, existing algorithms include the probability of a trajectory
under the current policy as a regularization term, which decreases the effect
of the gradient when the probability is low. However, by the time this effect
takes hold, useful tokens may have already been over-penalized as the model has
begun to degrade. To address this, we propose Future Policy Aware (FPA)
preference learning, which replaces the current policy with a future policy in
the regularization term. This future policy is estimated via lightweight,
logit-space extrapolation from a reference model toward the current model. FPA
enables safer training by preemptively regularizing potentially problematic
gradients. We apply FPA to DPO, RPO, and SimPER and evaluate them on the MATH
and GSM8K benchmarks. FPA yields consistent performance gains, with the largest
improvements observed with SimPER, achieving gains of up to 5.75%. We
demonstrate that FPA provides proactive regularization while preserving the
probability of shared, useful mathematical tokens, and enables longer,
degradation-free training with negligible computational overhead. We will
release our code publicly upon publication.

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验验证了所提出系统的有效性。提出了一个新的数据集 Kamino，其中包含来自运行车辆的近 12,000 张图像，带有八个同步摄像头。与类似的公共数据集相比，Kamino 数据集具有大量标记像素，并且包含来自模拟恶劣可见度下的矿山的越野试验场的图像。

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on
non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work
proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and
off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined
trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is
proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet
configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new
images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,
dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions
without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility
impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A
new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating
vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number
of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images
from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To
achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and
fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets
validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的植物自动识别技术主要集中在北美和西欧的物种上，而热带地区等生物多样性丰富的地区则缺乏数据。植物标本馆拥有大量数字化标本，可用于改善这种情况。

Method: PlantCLEF 2020 挑战赛使用南美洲圭亚那地盾的 1000 种植物的数据集，该数据集包含数十万份植物标本和数千张照片，用于训练跨域分类模型。

Result: 本文介绍了 PlantCLEF 2020 挑战赛的资源和评估结果，总结了参赛研究团队的方法和系统，并分析了主要成果。

Conclusion: 植物标本馆藏品可以有效改善数据匮乏地区植物的自动识别。

Abstract: Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the
recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data with
more and more photos in the field. However, this profusion of data only
concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mostly located in North America
and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity
such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists
have collected, catalogued and systematically stored plant specimens in
herbaria, particularly in tropical regions, and the recent efforts by the
biodiversity informatics community made it possible to put millions of
digitized sheets online. The LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (or
"PlantCLEF 2020") was designed to evaluate to what extent automated
identification on the flora of data deficient regions can be improved by the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFinder是一个用于dash-cam驾驶视频分析的框架，通过将视频转换为结构化数据并结合提示策略，提高了LLM的推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型在dash-cam视频分析中存在空间推理、因果推断和可解释性方面的挑战，因为它们缺乏结构化的归纳偏置。

Method: iFinder采用模块化、无训练的流程，利用预训练的视觉模型提取关键线索（物体姿态、车道位置和物体轨迹），并将其分层组织成帧和视频级别的结构。结合三模块提示策略，实现LLM的逐步、基于事实的推理。

Result: 在四个公共dash-cam视频基准测试中，iFinder显著优于端到端V-VLM，在事故推理准确性方面提高了高达39%。

Conclusion: iFinder通过使用驾驶领域特定的表示来grounding LLM，为事后驾驶视频理解提供了一种zero-shot、可解释且可靠的替代方案。

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc
dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose
training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole
modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing
video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning,
causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end,
we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples
perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical,
interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular,
training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract
critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which
are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined
with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning
for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning.
Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's
proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and
global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot
driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By
grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a
zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for
post-hoc driving video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的用于面部识别系统的无监督的机器学习卸载框架，可以在没有身份标签的情况下有效地移除目标样本，同时保持整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习卸载技术很大程度上依赖于需要身份标签的监督技术，但在隐私受限的情况或大规模噪声数据集中，身份标签通常不可用。

Method: 我们提出了CURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure)，这是第一个用于面部识别系统的无监督卸载框架，它在不使用身份标签的情况下运行，有效地移除目标样本，同时保持整体性能。我们还提出了一种新的指标，即卸载效率评分(UES)，它平衡了遗忘和保留稳定性，弥补了当前评估指标的不足。

Result: CURE明显优于现有卸载方法的无监督变体。此外，我们通过将低质量图像指定为遗忘集来进行质量感知卸载，证明了它的可用性和好处，并强调了图像质量在机器学习卸载中的作用。

Conclusion: CURE是一个有效的无监督卸载框架，可以有效地移除目标样本，同时保持整体性能。此外，图像质量在机器学习卸载中起着重要的作用。

Abstract: In the current digital era, facial recognition systems offer significant
utility and have been widely integrated into modern technological
infrastructures; however, their widespread use has also raised serious privacy
concerns, prompting regulations that mandate data removal upon request. Machine
unlearning has emerged as a powerful solution to address this issue by
selectively removing the influence of specific user data from trained models
while preserving overall model performance. However, existing machine
unlearning techniques largely depend on supervised techniques requiring
identity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained situations
or in large-scale, noisy datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce
CURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure), the first
unsupervised unlearning framework for facial recognition systems that operates
without the use of identity labels, effectively removing targeted samples while
preserving overall performance. We also propose a novel metric, the Unlearning
Efficiency Score (UES), which balances forgetting and retention stability,
addressing shortcomings in the current evaluation metrics. CURE significantly
outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods. Additionally,
we conducted quality-aware unlearning by designating low-quality images as the
forget set, demonstrating its usability and benefits, and highlighting the role
of image quality in machine unlearning.

TL;DR: 使用伪标签方法训练伪影检测器以提高图像生成模型的性能，无需手动标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练伪影检测器需要昂贵的像素级人工标注，缺乏标注数据限制了检测器的性能。

Method: 提出了一种伪影损坏管道，该管道可自动将伪影注入干净的高质量合成图像上的预定区域，从而生成像素级注释而无需手动标记。

Result: 与基线方法相比，所提出的方法能够训练伪影检测器，从而使 ConvNeXt 的性能提高 13.2%，Swin-T 的性能提高 3.7%，这已在人工标记数据上得到验证。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了朝着可扩展的像素级伪影注释数据集迈出的第一步，该数据集将世界知识集成到伪影检测中。

Abstract: Artifact detectors have been shown to enhance the performance of
image-generative models by serving as reward models during fine-tuning. These
detectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and
aesthetics. However, training the artifact detector requires expensive
pixel-level human annotations that specify the artifact regions. The lack of
annotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive
pseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate
unlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To
address this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically
injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined
region, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling. The
proposed method enables training of an artifact detector that achieves
performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T, as verified
on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches. This work represents an
initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that
integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种参数高效的多任务学习方法，通过共享初始层并在后续层中逐渐任务特定化来改进迁移学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法在多任务学习中面临任务冲突和负迁移的挑战，因为可训练参数有限。

Method: 提出了一种渐进式任务特定的多任务适配方法，该方法在预训练模型中引入适配器模块，这些模块在初始层中跨所有任务共享，并在后面的层中逐渐变得更具任务特定性。此外，还提出了一种基于梯度的任务相似性计算方法，并将相似的任务分配给共享的适配器模块。

Result: 在PASCAL和NYUD-v2数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于完全微调的多任务模型，同时只需要五分之一的可训练参数。相对于单任务微调，该方法实现了更好的相对改进，同时减少了可训练参数的数量，并超过了当前最先进的参数高效多任务学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在参数高效多任务学习方面表现出色，通过渐进式任务特定化和任务相似性度量，有效解决了任务冲突和负迁移问题。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising solution
for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. While these
methods perform well in single-task learning, extending them to multi-task
learning exacerbates common challenges, such as task interference and negative
transfer, due to the limited number of trainable parameters. To address these
issues, we introduce progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation, a novel
parameter-efficient approach for multi-task learning. This approach introduces
adapter modules in a pre-trained model such that these modules are shared
across all tasks in the initial layers and become progressively more
task-specific in the later layers. The motivation is to reduce the conflicts
among tasks by allowing transfer learning across all tasks in the initial
layers and enabling task-specific learning toward the prediction heads.
Additionally, we propose a gradient-based approach for computing task
similarity and use this measure to allocate similar tasks to the shared adapter
modules. Our task similarity method introduces minimal overhead in the
pipeline. We evaluate our approach by adapting the Swin Transformer for dense
prediction tasks. Experiments on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms a fully fine-tuned multi-task model while
requiring only one-fifth of the trainable parameters. This approach achieves
better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and surpasses the current state-of-the-art
methods for parameter-efficient multi-task learning.

*Mahmoud Afifi,Ran Zhang,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的、可学习的和可逆的预处理管道，用于调整原始图像以进行标准 JPEG 压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始数据保留完整的传感器信息，但 DNG 等格式需要大量存储空间，这在受限场景中不切实际。JPEG 格式具有高压缩效率和广泛的兼容性，但不适合原始存储。

Method: 该方法应用空间和可选的频域变换，紧凑的参数存储在 JPEG 注释字段中，从而实现精确的原始重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比直接 JPEG 存储具有更高的保真度，支持其他编解码器，并在压缩比和重建精度之间提供了良好的折衷。

Conclusion: RawJPEG Adapter 是一种有效的原始图像压缩方法，可以在存储空间和图像质量之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Digital cameras digitize scene light into linear raw representations, which
the image signal processor (ISP) converts into display-ready outputs. While raw
data preserves full sensor information--valuable for editing and vision
tasks--formats such as Digital Negative (DNG) require large storage, making
them impractical in constrained scenarios. In contrast, JPEG is a widely
supported format, offering high compression efficiency and broad compatibility,
but it is not well-suited for raw storage. This paper presents RawJPEG Adapter,
a lightweight, learnable, and invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw
images for standard JPEG compression. Our method applies spatial and optional
frequency-domain transforms, with compact parameters stored in the JPEG comment
field, enabling accurate raw reconstruction. Experiments across multiple
datasets show that our method achieves higher fidelity than direct JPEG
storage, supports other codecs, and provides a favorable trade-off between
compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激光雷达成本高昂，限制了高级自动驾驶系统的广泛应用。研究旨在通过训练神经网络，仅使用4D雷达生成类似激光雷达的3D点云，从而规避对激光雷达的需求。

Method: 研究调查了更高容量的分割骨干网络对生成点云质量的影响。

Result: 结果表明，过高容量的模型可能会降低性能，但优化的分割骨干网络可以将性能提升23.7%，超过现有技术水平。

Conclusion: 适当容量的分割骨干网络可以显著提高雷达生成激光雷达点云的质量。

Abstract: LiDAR's dense, sharp point cloud (PC) representations of the surrounding
environment enable accurate perception and significantly improve road safety by
offering greater scene awareness and understanding. However, LiDAR's high cost
continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD)
systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress
towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using
LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds
using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to
train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional
neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that
uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we
investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality
of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity
models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can
provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型(VLM)容易吸收和复制有害的社会刻板印象，特别是在存在年龄、性别、种族、服装或职业等视觉线索时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了调查这些风险。

Method: 引入了一个包含1,343个图像-问题对的新闻图像基准，这些图像-问题对来自不同的媒体，并用真实答案和人口属性(年龄、性别、种族、职业和运动)进行注释。评估了一系列最先进的VLM，并采用大型语言模型(LLM)作为判断标准，并进行人工验证。

Result: 视觉环境系统地改变了开放环境中的模型输出；不同属性和模型之间的偏差普遍存在差异，性别和职业的风险尤其高；更高的忠实度并不一定对应于更低的偏差。

Conclusion: 发布基准提示、评估标准和代码，以支持可重复和公平的多模态评估。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) can jointly interpret images and text,
but they are also prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes
when visual cues such as age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are
present. To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark
consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we
annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender,
race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and
employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our
findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in
open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models,
with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher
faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the
benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and
fairness-aware multimodal assessment.

Motivation: 现有的FSCIL方法使用冻结的特征提取器和类平均原型来缓解灾难性遗忘和过拟合，但新类别原型由于数据稀缺而存在显著的估计偏差，而基类原型受益于足够的数据。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为MoTiC的框架，该框架集成了动量自监督和虚拟类别，构建了一个具有丰富表示和增强类间凝聚力的特征空间。通过贝叶斯分析将新类先验与旧类统计对齐，并通过大规模对比学习来增强跨类别特征紧密度。

Result: 在三个FSCIL基准测试中，本文方法取得了最先进的性能，特别是在细粒度任务CUB-200上，验证了该方法减少估计偏差和提高增量学习鲁棒性的能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的MoTiC框架能够有效减少FSCIL中的估计偏差，并提高增量学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual
challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old
class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and
class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and
overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias
due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from
sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the
new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces
variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale
contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further
enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes,
we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum
Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with
rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three
FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the
fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation
bias and improve incremental learning robustness.

Motivation: 有效的云和云阴影检测是高光谱遥感中准确反演大气甲烷或其他痕量气体浓度的关键前提。云和云阴影会影响遥感图像中甲烷的反演，并影响排放量的量化。

Method: 研究部署并评估了传统技术（包括迭代逻辑回归 (ILR) 和多层感知器 (MLP)）以及先进的深度学习架构，即 UNet 和光谱通道注意力网络 (SCAN) 方法。

Result: 深度学习模型显着提高了检测质量：UNet 在保持空间结构方面表现最佳，而 SCAN 在捕获精细边界细节方面表现出色。值得注意的是，SCAN 在 MethaneSAT 数据上优于 UNet，突出了结合光谱注意力以获取卫星特定特征的优势。

Conclusion: 这项对各种不同的机器学习技术的深入评估证明了先进的深度学习架构在为云和云阴影筛选提供稳健、可扩展的解决方案方面的优势和有效性，从而增强现有和下一代高光谱任务的甲烷排放量化能力。

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for
accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace
gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent
for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this
study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow
detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.
Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened
out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the
quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques
including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel
Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods
struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the
detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially
improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure,
while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses
UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral
attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various
disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and
effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust,
scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing
methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation
hyperspectral missions. Our data and code is publicly available at

Structured Token Augmentation (STA) and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)- to
improve interpretability and mitigate these artefacts. STA enhances token
diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenisation, while ANF applies
learnable inline denoising between transformer layers. These methods are

ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2. Experimental results show consistent improvements
in visual quality and task performance, highlighting the practical

Motivation: 现有的模型通常难以处理复杂的时间变化，特别是在生成具有渐进属性过渡的视频时。最常见的运动过渡提示插值方法通常无法处理渐进属性过渡，其中不一致往往变得更加明显。

Method: 该方法为每个噪声潜在变量构建一个特定于数据的过渡方向，逐帧引导从初始属性到最终属性的逐渐转变，同时保留视频的运动动态。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的视频生成方法，可以有效地处理复杂的时间变化和渐进属性过渡，并在新的基准测试中取得了良好的效果。

Abstract: Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly
when generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common
prompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle
gradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more
pronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend
existing models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through
introducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach
constructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent,
guiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while
preserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the
Controlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both
attribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of
different models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and
smoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual
fidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless
attribute transitions. Code and CATBench are released:

Motivation: 传统神经网络检测CA无法保证基于临床相关特征，而基于定量特征的方法虽与临床相关但可能忽略视频信息。本研究旨在结合两者优点。

Method: 通过将心肌嵌入为一组变形点和对应的图像块，约束Transformer模型关注心肌区域。同时，在自监督学习的掩码自动编码器预训练中，也只掩盖和重建心肌区域。

Result: 在CA分类任务中，与完整视频Transformer相比，该模型提高了性能。

Conclusion: 通过将Transformer和预训练任务约束到心肌区域，模型能够更有效地关注CA成像特征，并提供分类集中于解剖区域的保证，同时可视化心肌的Transformer注意力得分。

Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare cardiomyopathy, with typical abnormalities
in clinical measurements from echocardiograms such as reduced global
longitudinal strain of the myocardium. An alternative approach for detecting CA
is via neural networks, using video classification models such as convolutional
neural networks. These models process entire video clips, but provide no
assurance that classification is based on clinically relevant features known to
be associated with CA. An alternative paradigm for disease classification is to
apply models to quantitative features such as strain, ensuring that the
classification relates to clinically relevant features. Drawing inspiration
from this approach, we explicitly constrain a transformer model to the
anatomical region where many known CA abnormalities occur -- the myocardium,
which we embed as a set of deforming points and corresponding sampled image
patches into input tokens. We show that our anatomical constraint can also be
applied to the popular self-supervised learning masked autoencoder
pre-training, where we propose to mask and reconstruct only anatomical patches.
We show that by constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the
myocardium where CA imaging features are localized, we achieve increased
performance on a CA classification task compared to full video transformers.
Our model provides an explicit guarantee that the classification is focused on
only anatomical regions of the echo, and enables us to visualize transformer
attention scores over the deforming myocardium.

Motivation: 现有方法要么只使用一个剪辑，忽略了其他剪辑的补充信息，要么使用所有剪辑，计算成本高昂，可能限制临床应用。

Method: 使用强化学习优化一种选择剪辑子集的方法。智能体学习持续处理特定视角的剪辑以减少疾病分类不确定性，或者在分类置信度足够时停止处理。此外，还提出了一种基于可学习注意力的聚合方法，作为融合多个剪辑信息的灵活方式。

Result: 在仅使用 30% 的剪辑的情况下，检测心脏淀粉样变性的 AUC 达到 0.91，超过了使用所有剪辑和其他基准测试所获得的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少计算成本的同时，提高了疾病分类的准确性。

Abstract: Guidelines for transthoracic echocardiographic examination recommend the
acquisition of multiple video clips from different views of the heart,
resulting in a large number of clips. Typically, automated methods, for
instance disease classifiers, either use one clip or average predictions from
all clips. Relying on one clip ignores complementary information available from
other clips, while using all clips is computationally expensive and may be
prohibitive for clinical adoption.
  To select the optimal subset of clips that maximize performance for a
specific task (image-based disease classification), we propose a method
optimized through reinforcement learning. In our method, an agent learns to
either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce the disease classification
uncertainty, or stop processing if the achieved classification confidence is
sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation
method as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The
proposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac
amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved
from using all clips and from other benchmarks.

to simultaneously achieve both high data diversity and a domain distribution
suitable for medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{SynthICL}, a
novel data synthesis framework built upon domain randomization. SynthICL
ensures realism by leveraging anatomical priors from real-world datasets,
generates diverse anatomical structures to cover a broad data distribution, and
explicitly models inter-subject variations to create data cohorts suitable for
ICL. Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets validate our framework's
effectiveness, showing that models trained with our data achieve performance
gains of up to 63\% in average Dice and substantially enhanced generalization
to unseen anatomical domains. Our work helps mitigate the data bottleneck for
ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. Our code and the
generated dataset are publicly available at

*Saimouli Katragadda,Guoquan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种单目视觉惯性运动和深度 (VIMD) 学习框架，通过利用基于 MSCKF 的单目视觉惯性运动跟踪来估计密集度量深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人和 XR 中，准确高效的密集度量深度估计至关重要。

Method: VIMD 的核心是利用多视图信息迭代地细化每个像素的尺度，而不是像先前的工作那样全局拟合不变仿射模型。该框架具有高度模块化，使其与各种现有的深度估计骨干兼容。

Result: 在 TartanAir 和 VOID 数据集上进行了广泛的评估，证明了其在 AR Table 数据集上的零样本泛化能力。即使每个图像只有 10-20 个度量深度点这样稀疏的点，VIMD 也能实现出色的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该 VIMD 是一种在资源受限环境中部署的实用解决方案，同时其强大的性能和强大的泛化能力在各种场景中提供了巨大的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual
perception in robotics and XR. In this paper, we develop a monocular
visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense
metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular
visual-inertial motion tracking. At the core the proposed VIMD is to exploit
multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale, instead of
globally fitting an invariant affine model as in the prior work. The VIMD
framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing
depth estimation backbones. We conduct extensive evaluations on the TartanAir
and VOID datasets and demonstrate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on
the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy
and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth
points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for
deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and
strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide
range of scenarios.

*Bo Yu,Jianhua Yang,Zetao Du,Yan Huang,Chenglong Li,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于语言引导的医学图像分割的频域多模态交互模型 (FMISeg)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法不能有效地增强视觉特征的表示，并消除语义上不相关的信息，最终导致次优的分割性能。

Method: 该方法引入了一个频域特征双向交互 (FFBI) 模块，以有效地融合频域特征。此外，在解码器中加入了一个语言引导的频域特征交互 (LFFI) 模块，以在语言信息的引导下抑制语义上不相关的视觉特征。

Result: 在 QaTa-COV19 和 MosMedData+ 上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量上都优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FMISeg 模型有效地利用了语言信息来指导医学图像分割，并在实验中取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Automatically segmenting infected areas in radiological images is essential
for diagnosing pulmonary infectious diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated
that the accuracy of the medical image segmentation can be improved by
incorporating clinical text reports as semantic guidance. However, the complex
morphological changes of lesions and the inherent semantic gap between
vision-language modalities prevent existing methods from effectively enhancing
the representation of visual features and eliminating semantically irrelevant
information, ultimately resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. To
address these problems, we propose a Frequency-domain Multi-modal Interaction
model (FMISeg) for language-guided medical image segmentation. FMISeg is a late
fusion model that establishes interaction between linguistic features and
frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Specifically, to enhance the
visual representation, our method introduces a Frequency-domain Feature
Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module to effectively fuse frequency-domain
features. Furthermore, a Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction
(LFFI) module is incorporated within the decoder to suppress semantically
irrelevant visual features under the guidance of linguistic information.
Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ demonstrated that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PolGS的极化高斯溅射模型，用于快速反射表面重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于3D高斯溅射(3DGS)的方法虽然提供了快速的新视角渲染，但其重建质量落后于隐式神经表示，特别是在恢复具有复杂反射反射率的表面时。

Method: 通过将偏振约束集成到3DGS框架中，PolGS有效地分离了镜面反射和漫反射分量。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验结果验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PolGS模型允许在10分钟内快速反射表面重建，并通过分离 specular 和 diffuse components 提高了具有挑战性的反射材料的重建质量。

Abstract: Efficient shape reconstruction for surfaces with complex reflectance
properties is crucial for real-time virtual reality. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS)-based methods offer fast novel view rendering by leveraging
their explicit surface representation, their reconstruction quality lags behind
that of implicit neural representations, particularly in the case of recovering
surfaces with complex reflective reflectance. To address these problems, we
propose PolGS, a Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting model allowing fast reflective
surface reconstruction in 10 minutes. By integrating polarimetric constraints
into the 3DGS framework, PolGS effectively separates specular and diffuse
components, enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective
materials. Experimental results on the synthetic and real-world dataset
validate the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 CAMILA 的上下文感知图像编辑方法，该方法验证指令和图像之间的上下文连贯性，从而只应用相关的编辑到指定的区域，同时忽略不可执行的指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型通常会盲目地遵循所有用户指令，即使这些指令本质上是不可行的或矛盾的，经常导致无意义的输出。

Method: CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment)。

Result: 该方法在处理复杂的指令挑战同时保持图像完整性方面表现出有效性，实现了比现有最佳模型更好的性能和更高的语义对齐。

Conclusion: CAMILA 在单指令和多指令图像编辑方面都优于现有技术，并且能够处理不可行的请求。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize
images through natural language instructions, offering considerable
flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to
follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently
infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address
these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as
CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment).
CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions
and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated
regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive
evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and
multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible
requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment
than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling
complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.

*Hongtao Yang,Bineng Zhong,Qihua Liang,Zhiruo Zhu,Yaozong Zheng,Ning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的Visual Fourier Prompt Tracking (VFPTrack)方法，通过快速傅里叶变换(FFT)学习模态相关的提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于参数高效微调(PEFT)的RGB-T跟踪方法通常只依赖空间域信息作为特征提取的提示，忽略了频域信息在提示学习中的关键作用，导致性能不佳。

Method: 该方法包括具有共享参数的对称特征提取编码器、视觉傅里叶提示和模态融合提示生成器，该生成器通过多模态特征融合生成双向交互提示。具体来说，首先使用冻结的特征提取编码器提取RGB和热红外(TIR)模态特征。然后，将空间域的视觉提示与从FFT获得的频域提示相结合，从而可以从不同的域信息中充分提取和理解模态特征。最后，使用模态融合提示生成模块，该模块结合来自不同模态的特征以生成融合的模态提示，该模态提示与每个单独的模态交互，以完全实现跨不同模态的特征交互。

Result: 在三个流行的RGB-T跟踪基准上进行的大量实验表明，该方法表现出出色的性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的RGB-T跟踪方法，通过在提示学习中引入频域信息，有效提升了跟踪性能。

Abstract: Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking
as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based
RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as
prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal
performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in
prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier
Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature
extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality
Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts
through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature
extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.
Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency
domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and
understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,
unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we
use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality
prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to
fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive
experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our
method demonstrates outstanding performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的数据集蒸馏方法RD^3，并系统地研究了不同的后评估设置如何影响测试精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解耦蒸馏方法存在不一致的后评估协议，阻碍了该领域的发展。

Method: 提出Rectified Decoupled Dataset Distillation (RD^3)，并系统地研究不同的后评估设置。

Result: 分析表明，大部分性能差异可归因于不一致的评估，而不是合成数据内在质量的差异。此外，还确定了提高不同设置下蒸馏数据集有效性的通用策略。

Conclusion: 通过建立标准化的基准和严格的评估协议，RD^3为未来数据集蒸馏研究中的公平和可重复比较奠定了基础。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to generate compact synthetic datasets that enable
models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to those trained on
full real datasets, while substantially reducing storage and computational
costs. Early bi-level optimization methods (e.g., MTT) have shown promising
results on small-scale datasets, but their scalability is limited by high
computational overhead. To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset
distillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training
from the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random
data augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase
to improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled
distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which
hinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled
Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different
post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the
reported performance differences across existing methods reflect true
methodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures.
Our analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed
to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of
the synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve
the effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a
standardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a
foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的半监督学习框架，该框架集成了SSL与基于熵的伪标签过滤(FilterMatch)和主动学习(AL)机制，在单次nnU-Net训练分割框架(nnFilterMatch)中运行，在减少标注需求的同时不影响精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的SSL_AL混合方法在每次标注后，通常依赖于迭代和基于循环的再训练周期，导致大量的计算开销，限制了其在临床应用中的可扩展性。

Method: 通过在训练期间选择性地排除高置信度的伪标签，我们的方法避免了再训练循环的需要，同时保留了不确定性引导学习的优点。

Result: 在多个临床分割基准上验证了所提出的框架，结果表明，即使只有5%-20%的标记数据，该框架也能达到或超过完全监督模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作引入了一种可扩展的端到端学习策略，用于减少医学图像分割中的标注需求，且不影响精度。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical
image segmentation, offering competitive performance while substantially
reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. When combined with active
learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by
selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional
SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining
cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational
overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we
present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation
framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering
(FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net
training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding
high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need
for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided
learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical
segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable
to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data.
This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing
annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出一个双阶段框架，用于通过面部动作单元 (AU) 进行细粒度表情控制的音频驱动说话头生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与先前依赖情感标签或隐式 AU 条件的方法不同，我们的模型显式地将 AU 映射到 2D 面部标志，从而实现物理基础的每帧表情控制。这种运动和外观的分离提高了表情准确性、时间稳定性和视觉逼真度。

Method: 第一阶段，变分运动生成器从音频和 AU 强度预测时间连贯的地标序列。在第二阶段，基于扩散的合成器生成逼真的、唇音同步的视频，这些视频以这些地标和参考图像为条件。

Result: 在 MEAD 数据集上的实验表明，我们的方法在多个指标上优于最先进的基线。

Conclusion: 证明了显式 AU 到地标建模对于表达性说话头生成的有效性。

Abstract: We propose a two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation
with fine-grained expression control via facial Action Units (AUs). Unlike
prior methods relying on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning, our model
explicitly maps AUs to 2D facial landmarks, enabling physically grounded,
per-frame expression control. In the first stage, a variational motion
generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU
intensities. In the second stage, a diffusion-based synthesizer generates
realistic, lip-synced videos conditioned on these landmarks and a reference
image. This separation of motion and appearance improves expression accuracy,
temporal stability, and visual realism. Experiments on the MEAD dataset show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics,
demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit AU-to-landmark modeling for
expressive talking head generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数ExpFace，通过在角度空间中引入角度指数项作为margin，对中心区域施加更大的惩罚，对外围区域施加较小的惩罚，从而强调干净样本，同时抑制噪声样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Margin的softmax损失忽略了噪声样本的影响。干净样本主要聚集在中心区域，而噪声样本倾向于向外围区域移动。

Method: 提出Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace)，它引入一个角度指数项作为margin，在角度空间中对中心区域施加更大的惩罚，对外围区域施加较小的惩罚。

Result: ExpFace实现了state-of-the-art的性能。

Conclusion: ExpFace不仅避免了SphereFace的训练不稳定性和ArcFace的非单调性，而且还表现出一种相似性曲线，该曲线以与角度空间中的决策边界相同的方式应用惩罚。

Abstract: Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power
to ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances.
Margin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have
been widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the
distribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples
predominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift
toward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the
Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular
exponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the
center region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular
space, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We
present a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses
in terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves,
showing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and
the non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that
applies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular
space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art
performance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code

Motivation: 现有LVLM在文档解析任务中表现出色，但缺乏显式的布局分析和阅读顺序分析，限制了其处理复杂文档的能力，如多栏报纸或海报。

Method: 提出Logics-Parsing模型，该模型基于LVLM，并结合强化学习，通过精心设计的奖励机制来优化布局分析和阅读顺序推理。此外，该模型还通过将化学公式和手写汉字等多种数据类型纳入监督微调来扩展其通用性。

Conclusion: Logics-Parsing模型在复杂文档分析方面表现出色，并在LogicsParsingBench数据集上取得了state-of-the-art的结果。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language models (LVLM) have spurred
significant progress in document parsing task. Compared to traditional
pipeline-based methods, end-to-end paradigms have shown their excellence in
converting PDF images into structured outputs through integrated Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), table recognition, mathematical formula
recognition and so on. However, the absence of explicit analytical stages for
document layouts and reading orders limits the LVLM's capability in handling
complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters. To address
this limitation, we propose in this report Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end
LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning. Our model incorporates
meticulously designed reward mechanisms to optimize complex layout analysis and
reading order inference. In addition, we expand the model's versatility by
incorporating diverse data types such as chemical formulas and handwritten
Chinese characters into supervised fine-tuning. Finally, to enable rigorous
evaluation of our approach, we introduce LogicsParsingBench, a curated set of
1,078 page-level PDF images spanning nine major categories and over twenty
sub-categories, which will be released later. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on LogicsParsingBench have validated the efficacy and
State-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our proposed model across diverse

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSC在评估分割结果时存在性别偏差，对女性小器官的误差惩罚更重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究忽略了DSC本身可能存在的性别偏差，尤其是在器官大小因性别而异的情况下。

Method: 在理想化的环境中，对50名参与者的手动MRI注释应用等大小的合成误差，量化DSC和归一化DSC的性别差异。

Result: 即使是最小的误差（如1毫米的边界偏移）也会产生系统性的性别DSC差异。小器官的平均DSC差异约为0.03，中等大小的器官约为0.01。大型器官（即肺和肝脏）基本不受影响。

Conclusion: 使用DSC作为评估指标的公平性研究不应期望男性和女性之间获得相同的分数，因为该指标本身会引入偏差。

Abstract: Overlap-based metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) penalize
segmentation errors more heavily in smaller structures. As organ size differs
by sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in
lower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.
While previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,
no study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.
This study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC
in an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied
equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants
to ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary
shift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,
average DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around
0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,
with sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that
fairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect
identical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A
segmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error
magnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work
raises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences
in segmentation performance. One that arises not from model behavior, but from
the metric itself. Recognizing this factor is essential for more accurate and
fair evaluations in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的 Vision Transformer 架构，专门为 HDR 重建而设计，以克服现有方法计算成本高和重影伪影的双重瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的边缘设备上实现高质量的高动态范围 (HDR) 成像是计算机视觉中的一项关键挑战，因为它的性能直接影响下游任务，例如智能监控和自动驾驶。多重曝光融合 (MEF) 是实现此目标的主流技术；但是，现有方法通常面临计算成本高和重影伪影的双重瓶颈，阻碍了它们的广泛部署。

Method: 本文基于上下文感知 Vision Transformer，首先将输入图像转换为 YCbCr 颜色空间以分离亮度和色度信息。然后，它采用交叉感知自适应融合 (IAAF) 模块来有效抑制重影。为了进一步实现轻量级设计，我们引入了反向残差嵌入 (IRE)、动态 Tanh (DyT)，并提出了增强型多尺度扩张卷积 (E-MSDC) 以在多个层级上降低计算复杂度。

Result: 与基线相比，主要版本将 FLOPS 减少了约 67%，并在 CPU 上的推理速度提高了五倍以上，在边缘设备上的推理速度提高了 2.5 倍。这些结果证实，我们的方法为边缘设备提供了一种高效且无重影的 HDR 成像解决方案，展示了各种动态场景中的多功能性和实用性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为边缘设备提供了一种高效且无重影的 HDR 成像解决方案，展示了各种动态场景中的多功能性和实用性。

Abstract: Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on
resource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision,
as its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent
surveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a
mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally
face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts,
hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a
light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR
reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the
Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the
YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then
employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress
ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce
Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced
Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at
multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main
version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in
computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between
performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared
to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and
increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge
device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and
ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and
practicality across various dynamic scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双任务对抗攻击方法BiTAA，该方法基于3D高斯溅射，可以同时降低检测性能并影响单目深度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D/3D攻击通常在任务孤岛中开发，缺乏诱导可控深度偏差的机制，并且没有标准化的协议来量化跨任务迁移，导致检测和深度之间的相互作用未被充分探索。

Method: 构建了一个基于3D高斯溅射的双任务对抗攻击BiTAA，引入了一个支持全图像和补丁设置的双模型攻击框架，该框架与常见的检测器和深度估计器兼容，并具有可选的期望转换（EOT）以适应物理现实。设计了一个复合损失，将检测抑制与感兴趣区域（ROI）内的有符号、幅度控制的对数深度偏差相结合，从而实现可控的近或远错误感知，同时保持跨任务的稳定优化。

Result: 提出了一个统一的评估协议，包括跨任务转移指标和真实世界的评估，显示了一致的跨任务性能下降，以及从检测到深度和从深度到检测转移之间的明显不对称性。

Conclusion: 结果突出了多任务纯视觉感知的实际风险，并推动了自动驾驶场景中跨任务感知的防御。

Abstract: Camera-based perception is critical to autonomous driving yet remains
vulnerable to task-specific adversarial manipulations in object detection and
monocular depth estimation. Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task
silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no
standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction
between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task
adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single
perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing
monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that
supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common
detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation
(EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that
couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth
bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far
misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also
propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and
real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear
asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results
highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate

*Shantanusinh Parmar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrCGAN 通过引入 3D 卷积、多光谱融合和天体物理正则化模块，在 CycleGAN 的基础上，提升了低分辨率天体摄影图像的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于小型望远镜观测的分辨率和质量有限，重建天体物体的高保真表示具有挑战性。传统模型（如 CycleGAN）仅限于 2D 映射，并且经常扭曲恒星和星系的形态。

Method: 该模型通过 3D 卷积层捕获体积空间相关性，利用多光谱融合对齐光学和近红外域，并使用天体物理正则化模块来保持恒星形态，从而扩展了 CycleGAN 框架。

Result: StrCGAN 生成的重建图像不仅在视觉上更清晰，而且在物理上更加一致，优于标准 GAN 模型。

Conclusion: StrCGAN 能够在天体图像增强任务中胜过标准 GAN 模型。

Abstract: We introduce StrCGAN (Stellar Cyclic GAN), a generative model designed to
enhance low-resolution astrophotography images. Our goal is to reconstruct
high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task
that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of
small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional
models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but
are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and
galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with
three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial
correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR)
domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar
morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning
optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain
consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to
generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically
consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical
image enhancement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 meta-weight-ensembler 的新方法，用于在持续学习中自适应地融合不同任务的知识，以缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型集成方法在任务和层级层面遇到知识冲突问题，导致新旧任务的学习性能下降。

Method: 采用通过元学习训练的混合系数生成器，为模型集成生成合适的混合系数，以解决任务级和层级的知识冲突。

Result: 在多个持续学习数据集上的实验表明，meta-weight-ensembler 有效地缓解了灾难性遗忘，并取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Meta-weight-ensembler 可以灵活地与现有的持续学习方法相结合，以提高它们缓解灾难性遗忘的能力。

Abstract: Model ensemble is an effective strategy in continual learning, which
alleviates catastrophic forgetting by interpolating model parameters, achieving
knowledge fusion learned from different tasks. However, existing model ensemble
methods usually encounter the knowledge conflict issue at task and layer
levels, causing compromised learning performance in both old and new tasks. To
solve this issue, we propose meta-weight-ensembler that adaptively fuses
knowledge of different tasks for continual learning. Concretely, we employ a
mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate
mixing coefficients for model ensemble to address the task-level knowledge
conflict. The mixing coefficient is individually generated for each layer to
address the layer-level knowledge conflict. In this way, we learn the prior
knowledge about adaptively accumulating knowledge of different tasks in a fused
model, achieving efficient learning in both old and new tasks.
Meta-weight-ensembler can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning
methods to boost their ability of alleviating catastrophic forgetting.
Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show that
meta-weight-ensembler effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于推理和可泛化的AI生成图像检测框架ThinkFake，该框架利用多模态大型语言模型（MLLM），通过伪造推理提示和使用群体相对策略优化（GRPO）强化学习进行训练，以实现逐步推理和可解释的结构化输出，并在GenImage和LOKI基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像的日益逼真引发了对错误信息和隐私侵犯的严重担忧，迫切需要准确和可解释的检测方法。现有方法主要依赖于二元分类，缺乏解释性，或过度依赖有监督的微调，导致泛化能力有限。

Method: 本文提出ThinkFake框架，利用多模态大型语言模型（MLLM），配备伪造推理提示，并使用群体相对策略优化（GRPO）强化学习进行训练。此外，还引入了一个结构化的检测流程，以提高推理质量和适应性。

Result: ThinkFake在GenImage基准测试中优于现有技术，并在LOKI基准测试中表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 实验结果验证了ThinkFake框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated images has raised serious concerns
about misinformation and privacy violations, highlighting the urgent need for
accurate and interpretable detection methods. While existing approaches have
made progress, most rely on binary classification without explanations or
depend heavily on supervised fine-tuning, resulting in limited generalization.
In this paper, we propose ThinkFake, a novel reasoning-based and generalizable
framework for AI-generated image detection. Our method leverages a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) equipped with a forgery reasoning prompt and is
trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning
with carefully designed reward functions. This design enables the model to
perform step-by-step reasoning and produce interpretable, structured outputs.
We further introduce a structured detection pipeline to enhance reasoning
quality and adaptability. Extensive experiments show that ThinkFake outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the GenImage benchmark and demonstrates strong
zero-shot generalization on the challenging LOKI benchmark. These results
validate our framework's effectiveness and robustness. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实的人类中心场景中部署具身智能体仍然具有挑战性，特别是在对个人人类偏好和行为进行建模时。

Method: 代理必须识别、检索和导航到与特定用户相关的对象，响应自然语言查询，例如“找到Lily的背包”。

Result: 与最先进的基线进行的实验表明，与人类的表现存在很大差距，这突出表明需要能够感知、推理和记忆个性化信息的具身智能体。

Conclusion: PersONAL基准测试为开发能够感知、推理和记忆个性化信息的具身智能体铺平了道路，从而为现实世界的辅助机器人铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly
complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents
in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains
challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human
preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized
Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study
personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to
objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries
such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality
episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode
includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations
between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific
semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation
in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes.
Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human
performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving,
reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards
real-world assistive robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在机器人技术中应用广泛，但其安全性和鲁棒性未得到充分研究。该研究旨在识别并形式化VLA模型中的一个关键对抗漏洞，即对抗图像可以“冻结”VLA模型，使其忽略后续指令。

Method: 提出了一个名为FreezeVLA的新型攻击框架，该框架通过min-max双层优化生成和评估action-freezing攻击。

Result: 在三个最先进的VLA模型和四个机器人基准测试中，FreezeVLA的平均攻击成功率为76.2%，显著优于现有方法。对抗图像具有很强的可转移性，单个图像可以可靠地诱导多种语言提示的瘫痪。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了VLA模型中的一个关键安全风险，并强调了对鲁棒防御机制的迫切需求。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are driving rapid progress in robotics by
enabling agents to interpret multimodal inputs and execute complex,
long-horizon tasks. However, their safety and robustness against adversarial
attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a
critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA
models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat
effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions,
potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically
study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that
generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level
optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic
benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%,
significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images
generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image
reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings
expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for
robust defense mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自适应指导的语义增强边缘云协同对象检测方法，利用多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 在准确性和效率之间实现了有效的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测方法在低光照和严重遮挡等复杂场景中面临性能下降的挑战，原因是缺乏高级语义理解。

Method: 该方法首先采用指令微调，使 MLLM 能够生成结构化场景描述。然后，它设计了一种自适应映射机制，将语义信息动态转换为边缘检测器的参数调整信号，实现实时语义增强。在边缘云协同推理框架内，系统根据置信度分数自动选择调用基于云的语义指导或直接输出边缘检测结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效地提高了复杂场景中的检测精度和效率。具体而言，在保持精度的同时，它可以将低光照和高度遮挡场景中的延迟降低 79% 以上，计算成本降低 70%。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景中有效地提高了检测精度和效率，同时降低了延迟和计算成本。

Abstract: Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges
in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a
lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes
an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object
detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving
an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method
first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured
scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that
dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for
edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud
collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between
invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection
results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex
scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost
by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的超像素分割方法，专门用于360度全景图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机视觉中，广角图像捕获设备的使用日益增多，需要快速准确的图像分析，因此需要专门的图像分割方法。

Method: 该方法名为SphSPS，它基于3D球面采集空间的几何结构，推广了像素和超像素中心之间最短路径的概念，以快速提取相关的聚类特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在分割精度、抗噪声性和规则性方面均优于现有的平面和球面方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的SphSPS方法在参考360度球面全景分割数据集和合成道路全向图像上得到了验证，为基于超像素的360度图像应用提供了一个非常有用的工具。

Abstract: The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and
accurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for
dedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods
segment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called
superpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment
standard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without
distortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called
SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide
360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of
the 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path
between a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering
features. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space
to compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation
accuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity
aspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space,
addressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure.
Finally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o
spherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional
images. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to
noise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based
applications on 360o images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了 Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN)，用于学习细胞图像表征，即使在有限的数据和参数预算下也能实现有效的表型建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提取具有生物学意义且批次稳健的细胞绘画表征仍然具有挑战性。传统的自监督和对比学习方法通常需要大型模型和/或大量精心策划的数据，并且仍然难以解决批次效应。

Method: CWA-MSN 框架通过在不同孔中对经受相同扰动的细胞嵌入进行对齐，从而在批次效应存在的情况下强制执行语义一致性。集成到掩蔽的 Siamese 架构中，这种对齐产生捕获细粒度形态的特征，同时保持数据和参数效率。

Result: 在基因-基因关系检索基准测试中，CWA-MSN 优于最先进的公开自监督 (OpenPhenom) 和对比学习 (CellCLIP) 方法，分别将基准分数提高了 +29% 和 +9%，同时在更少的数据（例如，CWA-MSN 为 0.2M 图像，而 OpenPhenom 为 2.2M 图像）或更小的模型尺寸（例如，CWA-MSN 为 22M 参数，而 CellCLIP 为 1.48B 参数）上进行训练。

Conclusion: CWA-MSN 是一种简单有效的细胞图像表征学习方法，即使在有限的数据和参数预算下也能实现有效的表型建模。

Abstract: Computational models that predict cellular phenotypic responses to chemical
and genetic perturbations can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing
therapeutic hypotheses and reducing costly wet-lab iteration. However,
extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting
representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and
contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge
amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We
present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel
representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to
the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency
despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this
alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining
data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship
retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly
available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP)
methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while
training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M
images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN
vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation,
enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter
budgets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于空地图像特征匹配的算法，该算法通过生成中间视图来缓解视角变化引起的透视畸变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂场景三维建模中空地图像难以找到可靠对应关系的问题。

Method: 1. 使用空中图像通过 SfM 引擎重建稀疏模型；2. 采用 3D Gaussian Splatting 进行场景渲染，并设计渲染视点确定算法生成高质量中间图像；3. 借助中间图像，进行可靠的特征匹配。

Result: 所提出的解决方案为空地图像提供可靠的特征匹配，显著增加了初始和精细匹配的数量，并为实现精确的 ISfM 重建和完整的 3DGS 场景渲染提供了足够的匹配。

Conclusion: 实验结果验证了该解决方案在特征匹配和场景渲染方面的有效性，并与广泛使用的方法进行了全面比较。

Abstract: The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in
3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding
reliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature
matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate
intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive
viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are
reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to
their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for
scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For
accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed
by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate
high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and
ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature
matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground
images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences
through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the
validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature
matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used
methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can
provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious
increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide
enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based
scene rendering.

TL;DR: GS-RoadPatching: 一种用于驾驶场景补全的修复方法，通过参考完全重建的区域，这些区域由 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) 表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 3DGS 修复方法依赖于基于 2D 透视图的扩散或 GAN 模型来预测缺失区域的有限外观或深度线索，而本文提出的方法能够直接通过 3DGS 模态实现替代场景修复和编辑，无需 2D 跨模态的时空一致性，也无需耗时的 Gaussian 重训练。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上进行了大量实验，证明了该方法在驾驶场景中的有效性和效率。结果表明，在质量和互操作性方面，该方法与基线方法相比，实现了最先进的性能。在一般场景中进行的额外实验也证明了所提出的 3D 修复策略的适用性。

Conclusion: GS-RoadPatching 是一种有效的驾驶场景补全方法，它利用 3DGS 的特征空间相似性进行结构匹配，实现了高质量和高效率的场景修复。

Abstract: This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene
completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are
represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting
methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based
diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing
regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing
directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring
spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for
time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly
repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities
within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for
structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.
Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch
measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and,
subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in
3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective
substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct
extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and
the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability.
Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed 3D inpainting strategy. The project page and code are available

Motivation: 分析CLIP-ResNet的神经元，发现神经元和注意力头的组合可以近似为图像-文本嵌入空间中的单个方向。

Method: 分析神经元和注意力头的成对组合，并将其与文本相关联。

Result: 发现只有少数神经元-头对对输出值有显著贡献，并且一些神经元-头对代表其对应神经元的子概念。利用这些观察结果进行免训练语义分割和数据集分布偏移监控。

Conclusion: 检查神经网络中的单个计算路径可以发现可解释的单元，并且这些单元可以用于下游任务。

Abstract: We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by
decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation
paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and
the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that
these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in
CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret
each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that
only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to
the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic,
represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these
observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free
semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second,
we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual
computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that
such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户难以用文字清晰表达投诉，但上传产品缺陷视频却很容易。现有研究在解释性投诉挖掘方面存在大量工作，但通过文本或视频表达用户诉求仍然是一个重大挑战，问题常常无法解决。

Method: 引入了一个包含 1175 个投诉视频和相应描述的视频投诉数据集 ComVID，并标注了投诉者的情绪状态。提出了一个新的投诉保留 (CR) 评估指标，并设计了一个多模态检索增强生成 (RAG) 嵌入的 VideoLLaMA2-7b 模型，用于生成投诉并考虑用户的情绪状态。

Result: 对多个视频语言模型在多个任务上进行了全面评估，使用了包括 METEOR、困惑度和 Coleman-Liau 可读性评分在内的多种评估指标。

Conclusion: 为用户通过视频表达投诉奠定了新的研究方向的基础，并提供了一个平台。

Abstract: While there exists a lot of work on explainable complaint mining,
articulating user concerns through text or video remains a significant
challenge, often leaving issues unresolved. Users frequently struggle to
express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting
product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a
5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper
formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users'
need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from
Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the
defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint
dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions,
also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we
present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the
proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description
tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to
generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks
(pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation
metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score,
among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to
provide a platform for users to express complaints through video. Dataset and

TL;DR: SynchroRaMa is a novel framework for audio-driven talking face generation that integrates multi-modal emotion embedding, an audio-to-motion module, and scene descriptions from a Large Language Model to generate talking face videos with richer emotional expressiveness, natural head motion, and accurate lip synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single modality for emotion embedding, limiting their ability to capture nuanced affective cues. Most methods condition on a single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic changes in actions or attributes across time.

Method: SynchroRaMa integrates a multi-modal emotion embedding by combining emotional signals from text and audio. It includes an audio-to-motion (A2M) module and incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model (LLM) as additional textual input.

Result: SynchroRaMa outperforms the state-of-the-art in image quality, expression preservation, and motion realism. User study confirms higher subjective ratings in overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness.

Conclusion: SynchroRaMa is a novel framework that enhances temporal consistency and visual realism in audio-driven talking face generation.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest,
particularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar
interaction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single
modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability
to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a
single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic
changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we
introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion
embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and
audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal
features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more
authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion
and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M)
module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally,
SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model
(LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and
high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and
textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa
outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality,
expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that
SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in
overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness. Our project page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniScene，一个类似人类的框架，用于自动驾驶系统中的 4D 场景理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统缺乏像人类一样的场景理解能力，主要依赖于基于深度的 3D 重建。

Method: 提出 OmniScene 视觉-语言模型 (OmniVLM)，结合多视角和时间感知进行整体 4D 场景理解；利用 teacher-student 架构和知识蒸馏，将文本表示嵌入 3D 实例特征以进行语义监督；提出分层融合策略 (HFS) 以解决多模态融合中的模态贡献不平衡问题。

Result: 在 nuScenes 数据集上进行了全面的评估，并在感知、预测、规划和视觉问答等任务中优于当前最优模型。

Conclusion: OmniScene 建立了新的基准，并在各项任务中取得了优异的成果。

Abstract: Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an
egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability
to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability,
however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where
mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather
than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene
Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates
multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,
harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,
we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic
supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like
attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with
human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like
perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a
Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality
contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates
the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple
abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from
visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more
nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate
OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over
ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently
achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception,
prediction, planning, and visual question answering.

Motivation: 现有的方法主要集中于透视投影视频生成中的相机控制，而几何一致的全景视频生成仍然具有挑战性。全景姿态表示和球面投影存在固有的复杂性。

Method: 提出了全景Pl"ucker嵌入，通过球面坐标变换编码相机外参，并引入了一个球面极线模块，该模块通过沿极线的自适应注意掩蔽来强制执行几何约束。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法生成的全景视频与相机轨迹一致，质量高，远远超过了现有的全景视频生成方法。

Conclusion: CamPVG是第一个基于扩散的框架，用于精确相机姿态引导的全景视频生成，它通过全景Pl"ucker嵌入和球面极线模块有效地解决了全景视频生成中的几何一致性问题。

Abstract: Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development,
offering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods
predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video
generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains
challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in
panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue,
we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video
generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding
for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical
projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl\"ucker embedding that
encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate
transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to
equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar
module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking
along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature
aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated
panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far
surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

Conclusion: 实验表明，SDE-DET为沙田柚检测提供了一种可靠的方法，为自动采摘机器人的进一步发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pomelo detection is an essential process for their localization, automated
robotic harvesting, and maturity analysis. However, detecting Shatian pomelo in
complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including
multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object
detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset
STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection.
SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional
information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the
presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its
ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple
Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to
reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations,
thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment,
we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models
in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of
0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5,
mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET
provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation
for the further development of automatic harvest robots.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的代理目标攻击（PTA）方法，用于解决多模态预训练模型中现有目标对抗攻击的局限性，即泛化性和不可检测性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态预训练模型目标对抗攻击在泛化到部分已知或语义相似的目标以及被简单异常检测方法检测方面存在局限性，引起了严重的安全问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为代理目标攻击（PTA）的新方法，该方法利用多个源模态和目标模态代理来优化目标AE，确保它们在与多个潜在目标对齐的同时，保持对防御的规避性。同时，提供了理论分析，以强调泛化性和不可检测性之间的关系，并确保在满足指定的不可检测性要求的同时，实现最佳的泛化性。

Result: 实验结果表明，PTA可以在各种相关目标上实现高成功率，并且对于多种异常检测方法保持不可检测。

Conclusion: PTA方法能够有效提高多模态预训练模型目标对抗攻击的泛化性和不可检测性。

Abstract: Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data
modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across
downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security
concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained
models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and
undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs)
exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar
targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can
be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited
undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method
called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and
target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to
defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide
theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and
undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the
specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results
demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related
targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

*Nico Schulthess,Ender Konukoglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文利用基础模型的嵌入进行医学图像中的无监督异常检测，从而在推理时至少减少一半的计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小数据集的规范特征内存库可以直接用于异常检测，但是，这不适合大型医学数据集，因为计算负担会大大增加。

Method: 我们提出使用Dirichlet过程混合模型（DPMM）对规范DINOv2嵌入的分布进行建模，Dirichlet过程混合模型是一种非参数混合模型，可以自动调整混合成分的数量以适应手头的数据。我们使用组件中心和嵌入之间的相似性作为异常评分函数，以创建粗略的异常分割掩码，而不是使用内存库。

Result: 我们的实验表明，通过DINOv2的DPMM嵌入，尽管在自然图像上进行了训练，但在医学成像基准测试上获得了非常有竞争力的异常检测性能，并且可以在推理时至少将计算时间减半。

Conclusion: 我们的分析进一步表明，归一化的DINOv2嵌入通常比未归一化的特征更符合解剖结构，即使在存在异常的情况下也是如此，这使它们成为异常检测的绝佳表示。

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for
unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a
memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection
which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large
medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially.
Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings
with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model
that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at
hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the
component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a
coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM
embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very
competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can
do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis
further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned
with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of
anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习中，高效的数据注释仍然是一个关键挑战，特别是在需要大量标记数据的对象检测任务中。

Method: 该方法确保选择具有代表性的示例，从而提高模型泛化能力。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的结果表明，基于 AL 的示例选择明显优于随机抽样，在有限的预算内减少了注释工作，同时保持了与完全监督模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在相同的注释预算内实现了更高的 mAP 分数。

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning,
particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data.
Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL
approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances
suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling
efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of
representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our
method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using
state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our
results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms
random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while
maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method
achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像篡改定位框架RITA，它将图像篡改定位重新定义为条件序列预测任务，通过分层预测篡改区域，显式地建模编辑操作之间的时间依赖性和层级结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像篡改定位方法忽略了篡改过程的 sequentiality 和 hierarchical characteristics，直接预测定位掩码，导致维度崩溃，与 IML 任务的内在性质不匹配。

Method: RITA 框架通过使用每一步的预测作为下一步的条件，以有序的方式逐层预测被操纵的区域。

Result: RITA 在传统基准测试中取得了 SOTA 结果，并为新的分层定位任务提供了坚实的基础。

Conclusion: RITA 作为一个通用且有效的范例，具有巨大的潜力。

Abstract: Image manipulations often entail a complex manipulation process, comprising a
series of editing operations to create a deceptive image, exhibiting
sequentiality and hierarchical characteristics. However, existing IML methods
remain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in
a one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps.
This one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into
a single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a
fundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.
  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation
localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA
framework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered
manner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby
explicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among
editing operations.
  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data
and construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess
sequential order and hierarchical alignment. Extensive experiments show RITA
achieves SOTA on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for the
novel hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as a general and
effective paradigm. The code and dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 现有方法主要集中于整合WSI与基因组或转录组数据，而病理报告作为临床工作流程的重要组成部分，可以提供互补信息，从而进一步提高预后性能。

Method: 提出了一种基于原型的方法来生成平衡的表示，然后使用基于Transformer的融合模型进行整合，该模型称为PS3。PS3包括从病理报告中提取诊断原型，从WSI中提取组织学原型，以及编码转录组表达的生物通路原型。

Result: 在来自癌症基因组图谱 (TCGA) 的六个数据集上进行评估时，该模型优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: PS3模型能够有效地整合病理报告、WSI和转录组数据，提高癌症生存预测的准确性。

Abstract: Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily
focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with
genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We
hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic
performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows,
offer readily available complementary information by summarizing
histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical
context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their
heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several
billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of
varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we
propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which
are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival
prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities).
Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports,
leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and
standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly
represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway
prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular
functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting
prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal
interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The
proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against
clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.

Motivation: 生物识别身份验证系统被广泛采用，但是，这些系统不允许参与用户影响其数据的使用方式。此外，数据可能会泄漏并在用户不知情的情况下被滥用。

Method: 建议使用GAN将人脸图像转换为视觉隐私域（例如，鲜花或鞋子）。然后，用于身份验证目的的分类器在来自视觉隐私域的图像上进行训练。

Result: 该方法可以有效防御攻击，同时保持相当的实用性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于GAN的保护隐私的身份验证方法。

Abstract: Biometric-based authentication systems are getting broadly adopted in many
areas. However, these systems do not allow participating users to influence the
way their data is used. Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused
without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication
method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative
adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating
images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes).
Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on
the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the
method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.

Method: 该论文提出了一种轻量级模型来预测视频帧的质量分数，从而确定其对资源密集型oracle模型的适用性。

Result: 该框架在包含来自105部智能手机的32,000多张图像的大规模数据集上进行了验证，并使用了重新上下文化的FNMR和ISRR指标。此外，对来自不同工业印刷机的图形进行的跨域分析表明，在冻结的ImageNet预训练网络上的轻量级探针比完全微调的模型更好地推广到看不见的印刷技术。

Conclusion: 对于来自物理制造的领域转移，冻结的通用骨干网络可能比完全微调更强大，后者可能会过度拟合到源域伪影。

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting
tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user
captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates,
creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from
traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively
estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a
lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its
suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated
using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of
32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis
on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a
lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better
to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a
key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical
manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full
fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

Abstract: Progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) faces significant
bottlenecks, particularly in rigorously evaluating complex interactive systems
and acquiring the vast interaction data needed for training adaptive agents.
This paper posits that user simulation -- creating computational agents that
mimic human interaction with AI systems -- is not merely a useful tool, but is
a critical catalyst required to overcome these bottlenecks and accelerate AGI
development. We argue that realistic simulators provide the necessary
environments for scalable evaluation, data generation for interactive learning,
and fostering the adaptive capabilities central to AGI. Therefore, research
into user simulation technology and intelligent task agents are deeply
synergistic and must advance hand-in-hand. This article elaborates on the
critical role of user simulation for AGI, explores the interdisciplinary nature
of building realistic simulators, identifies key challenges including those
posed by large language models, and proposes a future research agenda.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的评估方法通常由于数据有限和任务周期长而导致高方差，或者由于支持不均或环境模型不准确而导致高偏差。

Method: 提出了一种evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL)，旨在最大化预期回报，同时最小化给定价值预测方案下的预期评估误差。

Result: 理论分析和经验结果表明，在使用EvA-RL中的固定价值预测方案时，评估准确性和策略性能之间通常存在权衡。为了缓解这种权衡，我们扩展了我们的方法，以在策略的同时共同学习一个以评估为条件的state-value predictor。

Conclusion: EvA-RL可以显著减少评估误差，同时保持竞争性回报。这项工作为一类新的RL方法奠定了基础，这些方法在训练期间将可靠的评估视为首要原则。

Abstract: Policy evaluation is often a prerequisite for deploying safety- and
performance-critical systems. Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer
from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due
to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these
challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL)
paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an
alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in
which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously
minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --
in other words, being "easy" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL
and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,
conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can
be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis
and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation
accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme
within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an
assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical
results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that
EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive
returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that
treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.

Method: 分析了llm的自我一致性估计器，以及在固定计算预算 B=mn 下，该估计器所带来的权衡，其中 m 是从任务分布中抽样的提示数量，n 是每个提示的重复llm调用次数。

Method: 研究设计了Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE)基准测试，通过系统地操纵无关信息（Context Saturation）和任务切换干扰（Attentional Residue）来评估模型性能。研究对五个指令调优模型进行了综合研究（每个项目10次重复，共200个问题）。

Result: 研究发现，较小的开源架构（Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2）在所有条件下（包括干净的控制条件）的准确率均为0%。Gemini-2.0-Flash-001在控制条件下的准确率为85%，但在上下文饱和下性能显著下降（$\\\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，认知负荷是导致推理失败的关键因素，并支持了在不确定性下将幻觉视为猜测的理论。动态、认知感知的压力测试对于评估高级人工智能系统的真正弹性和安全性至关重要。

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap
between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic,
information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the
computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain
poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational
cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context
Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key
mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive
Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these
load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N
= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant
performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller
open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all
conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In
contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%
accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation
under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These
findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor
to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under
uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as
exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true
resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

*Ramy ElMallah,Krish Chhajer,Chi-Guhn Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的机器人学习评估框架StepEval，旨在更细粒度地评估策略在多步骤操作任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器人学习论文通常只报告一个二元成功率，无法展示策略在每个子目标上的表现。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型(VLMs)作为自动化裁判，从记录的图像或视频中判断子目标的完成情况，并生成每个轨迹的子目标成功率向量。

Result: 提出了StepEval的蓝图，这是一个成本感知的插件评估框架，可以评估策略在每个子目标上的成功率，并考虑延迟和成本等因素。

Conclusion: 旨在创建一个可扩展、社区驱动的开源项目，使子目标级别的评估成为一种标准和可重复的实践。

Abstract: Robot learning papers typically report a single binary success rate (SR),
which obscures where a policy succeeds or fails along a multi-step manipulation
task. We argue that subgoal-level reporting should become routine: for each
trajectory, a vector of per-subgoal SRs that makes partial competence visible
(e.g., grasp vs. pour). We propose a blueprint for StepEval, a cost-aware
plug-in evaluation framework that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) as
automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images or videos. Rather
than proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design
principles for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval,
the primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector;
however, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered
for framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation
efficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available.
We discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or
multi-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended
contribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites
open-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal,
becomes a standard and reproducible practice.

Abstract: We investigate the application of Small Language Models (<10 billion

lower computational resources than conventional approaches. This demonstrates
promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of
ML-powered genomics tools while retaining highly robust and accurate

Result: 论文提出了一个自适应算法，可以显著降低样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 该研究为通过基准更可靠和值得信赖地估计人工智能能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and
their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI's
capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we
know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance?
Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are
inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to
assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make
this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as
inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for
estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has
not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address
a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations.
After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability
while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including
an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together,
these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy
estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries that
demand both sophisticated mathematical reasoning and intricate schema
navigation. Existing methods often tackle these challenges in isolation,
creating a fractured reasoning process that compromises logical and structural
correctness. To resolve this, we introduce SteinerSQL, a framework that unifies
these dual challenges into a single, graph-centric optimization problem.
SteinerSQL operates in three stages: mathematical decomposition to identify
required tables (terminals), optimal reasoning scaffold construction via a
Steiner tree problem, and multi-level validation to ensure correctness. On the
challenging LogicCat and Spider2.0-Lite benchmarks, SteinerSQL establishes a
new state-of-the-art with 36.10% and 40.04% execution accuracy, respectively,
using Gemini-2.5-Pro. Beyond accuracy, SteinerSQL presents a new, unified

Motivation: 推理模型在自我评估方面表现不佳，这限制了测试时计算策略的有效性。

Method: 通过强化学习训练一个成对解释验证器 (GRPO)，它可以为生成的解决方案生成校准的置信度分数和相关的自然语言推理。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习在训练智能体模型方面表现出潜力，但其最终价值在于协助用户，而用户交互的多样性和动态性带来了挑战。

Method: 提出UserRL框架，结合标准化的gym环境和模拟用户，系统地改变turn-level奖励分配和trajectory-level分数计算，以分析不同公式对GRPO算法学习的影响。

Result: SFT冷启动对于解锁初始交互能力和实现持续的RL改进至关重要；深思熟虑的轨迹评分可以产生更高效和有效的多轮交互；更强大的模拟用户（例如，GPT-4o）有助于训练，而开源模拟器（例如，Qwen3-32B）仍然是具有成本效益和可转移的选择。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造和用户模拟选择的仔细设计与模型规模同等重要，并将UserRL确立为开发强大的以用户为中心的智能体模型的实用途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that
move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions.
Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a
setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In
this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating
user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with
simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and
trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect
learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal
three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial
interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate
trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;
and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,
open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and
transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of
reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and
establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric
agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLM）的推理依赖于大量的测试时计算，但由于模型冗长和指令执行不佳，导致计算资源浪费。

Method: 引入了一种优化的推理工作流程（CEPO）。

Result: 小型开源模型在性能上超过了比它们大几倍的模型。

Conclusion: 通过共同设计编排框架和底层模型能力，可以在中小型模型中释放强大的推理能力。

Abstract: Modern LLM reasoning relies on extensive test-time computation, driven by
internal model training and external agentic orchestration. However, this
synergy is often inefficient, as model verbosity and poor instruction following
lead to wasted compute. We analyze this capability-cost trade-off and introduce
an optimized reasoning workflow (\cepo) that empowers smaller open-source
models to outperform models multiple times their size. We will open-source this
workflow to enable further research. Our work demonstrates a clear path toward
co-designing orchestration frameworks with the underlying model capabilities to
unlock powerful reasoning in small-to-medium sized models.

TL;DR: 自主Agent在低代码/无代码环境中面临可靠性挑战。本文提出了一种新的架构模式，通过集成一个“元认知”层来主动监控主要的LCNC Agent，以预测任务失败并启动人工交接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主Agent在低代码/无代码环境中，由于其内在的非确定性，容易陷入循环、产生不准确的输出或遭遇无法恢复的失败，导致用户沮丧和信任崩溃。

Method: 集成一个“元认知”层，该层主动监控主要的LCNC Agent。该层基于预定义的触发器（如过度延迟或重复动作）来预测即将发生的任务失败，并在预测到失败时主动启动人工交接。

Result: 原型系统的实证分析表明，该方法显著提高了总体任务成功率，但计算开销也显著增加。

Conclusion: 人工交接不是失败的 признание，而是增强系统弹性、改善用户体验和建立信任的核心设计特性。

Abstract: The inherent non-deterministic nature of autonomous agents, particularly
within low-code/no-code (LCNC) environments, presents significant reliability
challenges. Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate
outputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a
breakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to
address these issues: the integration of a secondary, "metacognitive" layer
that actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection,
this layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined
set of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon
predicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human
handoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's "thought
process" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical
analysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly
increases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes
with a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human
handoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that
enhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by
providing transparency into the agent's internal state. The report discusses
the practical and ethical implications of this approach and identifies key
directions for future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种求解基于线性规划的马尔可夫决策问题(MDP)的新方法，该方法利用对数障碍函数将约束优化问题转化为无约束优化问题，并通过梯度下降法求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于线性规划的MDP方法不如动态规划常用，因为前者会产生不等式约束优化问题，求解更具挑战性。

Method: 利用对数障碍函数将线性规划形式的MDP转化为无约束优化问题，然后通过梯度下降法获得近似解。

Result: 为该方法建立理论基础

Conclusion: 填补了该方法缺乏理论解释的空白。

Abstract: There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs):
dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP).
Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of
both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based
methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained
attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based
methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained
optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively
compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to
establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more
effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier
function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the
LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This
reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient
descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a
thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been
developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LATENTGUARD的三阶段框架，该框架结合了行为对齐和监督潜在空间控制，以实现可解释且精确的安全指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型语言模型（LLM）中实现强大的安全对齐，同时保持其效用仍然是一个根本的挑战。现有的方法通常难以在全面的安全性和表征层面的细粒度可控性之间取得平衡。

Method: 首先，在包含对抗性提示的理性化拒绝响应和良性查询的理性化正常响应的数据集上对LLM进行微调，从而在安全关键和效用保持场景中建立稳健的行为先验。然后，在中间MLP激活上训练一个结构化的变分自动编码器（VAE），该编码器由包括攻击类型、攻击方法和良性指标在内的多标签注释进行监督。这种监督使VAE能够学习解开的潜在表示，这些表示捕获不同的对抗特征，同时保持语义可解释性。通过对学习到的潜在维度进行有针对性的操纵，LATENTGUARD实现了选择性的拒绝行为，从而有效地阻止了有害请求，同时保持了对合法用例的帮助性。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B上的实验表明，在不影响效用的前提下，安全可控性和响应可解释性均得到了显着改善。在Mistral-7B上进行的跨架构验证证实了我们的潜在指导方法的普遍性，表明在不同的模型系列中具有一致的有效性。

Conclusion: 结构化的表示级别干预为构建更安全但实用的LLM系统提供了一条有希望的途径。

Abstract: Achieving robust safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) while
preserving their utility remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches
often struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained
controllability at the representation level. We introduce LATENTGUARD, a novel
three-stage framework that combines behavioral alignment with supervised latent
space control for interpretable and precise safety steering. Our approach
begins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both
reasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and
reasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust
behavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios.
We then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP
activations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types,
attack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to
learn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial
characteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted
manipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective
refusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving
helpfulness for legitimate use cases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate
significant improvements in both safety controllability and response
interpretability without compromising utility. Cross-architecture validation on
Mistral-7B confirms the generalizability of our latent steering approach,
showing consistent effectiveness across different model families. Our results
suggest that structured representation-level intervention offers a promising
pathway toward building safer yet practical LLM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着企业越来越多地将ChatGPT和Gemini等基于云的大型语言模型（LLM）集成到其法律文档工作流程中，保护敏感的合同信息（包括个人身份信息（PII）和商业敏感条款）已成为一项严峻的挑战。

Method: CON-QA框架通过三个阶段运行：（i）使用本地部署的LLM分析进行语义查询分解和查询感知文档块检索，（ii）通过结构化的一对多映射方案对检测到的敏感实体进行匿名化，确保语义连贯性，同时防止跨会话实体推理攻击，以及（iii）通过基于云的LLM生成匿名响应，并使用会话一致的多对一反向映射在本地准确重建原始答案。

Result: 实证评估，辅以详细的人工评估，证实CON-QA有效地维护了隐私和效用，保留了答案质量，保持了对法律条款语义的忠实性，并显着降低了隐私风险，证明了其在安全的企业级合同文档中的实际适用性。

Conclusion: CON-QA框架在保护企业合同信息的隐私和效用方面表现出色，为安全的企业级合同文档提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As enterprises increasingly integrate cloud-based large language models
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini into their legal document workflows,
protecting sensitive contractual information - including Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) and commercially sensitive clauses - has emerged
as a critical challenge. In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid
privacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question
answering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and
cloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i)
semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a
locally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive
entities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic
coherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii)
anonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate
reconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent
many-to-one reverse mapping. To rigorously evaluate CON-QA, we introduce
CUAD-QA, a corpus of 85k question-answer pairs generated over 510 real-world
CUAD contract documents, encompassing simple, complex, and summarization-style
queries. Empirical evaluations, complemented by detailed human assessments,
confirm that CON-QA effectively maintains both privacy and utility, preserves
answer quality, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly
mitigates privacy risks, demonstrating its practical suitability for secure,
enterprise-level contract documents.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for
achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for
various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical
systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models
(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs
empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing
high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions
into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building
internal representations and future predictions of the external world,
facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper
comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,
covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present
the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied
AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal
angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,
embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,
meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied
cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the
above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint
MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound
significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we
examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide
applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future
research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.

Motivation: 当前prompt工程和多智能体方法通常优化孤立的推论，忽略了可重复使用的临床经验的积累。为了解决这个问题。

Method: 该研究提出了一个新颖的多智能体临床诊断（MACD）框架，并将其扩展到MACD-人协作工作流程。

Result: 在对七种疾病的4,390个真实患者案例进行评估后，MACD显着提高了初步诊断的准确性，优于既定的临床指南，收益高达22.3% (MACD)。在数据的子集上，它实现了与人类医生相当或超过人类医生的表现（比仅医生诊断提高高达16%）。此外，在MACD-人工作流程中，与仅医生诊断相比，它实现了18.6%的改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一种可扩展的LLM辅助诊断的自学习范例，弥合了LLM的内在知识与现实世界临床实践之间的差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical
applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex
real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current
prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated
inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To
address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD)
framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent
pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors
how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and
accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a
MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician
agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and
human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390
real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs
(Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves
primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with
gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on
par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over
physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it
achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover,
self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability,
and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable
rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a
scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap
between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文动机在于理解群体智能如何通过简单智能体之间的去中心化交互实现集体问题解决。

Method: 论文通过建模执行觅食任务的工程线虫群，展示了信息素动态如何在数学上反映交叉学习更新，这是一种基本的强化学习算法。同时，通过计算实验，在多臂老虎机场景中引入少量对信息素不敏感的探索性智能体。

Result: 研究结果表明，持续存在的信息素轨迹会产生正反馈回路，从而阻碍适应性，但引入少量对信息素不敏感的探索性智能体可以恢复集体可塑性，从而实现快速任务切换。此外，论文证实信息素系统固有地编码了分布式强化学习过程，其中环境信号充当集体信用分配的外部记忆。

Conclusion: 论文通过连接合成生物学和群体机器人技术，推进了能够在易变环境中进行弹性决策的可编程生命系统。

Abstract: Swarm intelligence emerges from decentralised interactions among simple
agents, enabling collective problem-solving. This study establishes a
theoretical equivalence between pheromone-mediated aggregation in \celeg\ and
reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrating how stigmergic signals function as
distributed reward mechanisms. We model engineered nematode swarms performing
foraging tasks, showing that pheromone dynamics mathematically mirror
cross-learning updates, a fundamental RL algorithm. Experimental validation
with data from literature confirms that our model accurately replicates
empirical \celeg\ foraging patterns under static conditions. In dynamic
environments, persistent pheromone trails create positive feedback loops that
hinder adaptation by locking swarms into obsolete choices. Through
computational experiments in multi-armed bandit scenarios, we reveal that
introducing a minority of exploratory agents insensitive to pheromones restores
collective plasticity, enabling rapid task switching. This behavioural
heterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs, implementing
swarm-level extinction of outdated strategies. Our results demonstrate that
stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed RL processes, where
environmental signals act as external memory for collective credit assignment.
By bridging synthetic biology with swarm robotics, this work advances
programmable living systems capable of resilient decision-making in volatile
environments.

*Tong Nie,Yuewen Mei,Yihong Tang,Junlin He,Jie Sun,Haotian Shi,Wei Ma,Jian Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个可操纵的对抗场景生成框架（SAGE），它允许在对抗性和真实性之间进行细粒度的权衡，而无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗场景生成方法通常局限于对抗性和真实性之间单一的、固定的权衡，缺乏灵活性和效率，无法为不同的训练和测试需求生成定制的场景。

Method: 将对抗场景生成任务重新定义为多目标偏好对齐问题，并提出了分层分组偏好优化方法，通过解耦硬可行性约束和软偏好来平衡竞争目标。SAGE训练两个具有相反偏好的专家模型，并通过线性插值它们的权重来构建策略的连续谱。

Result: SAGE不仅生成了在对抗性和真实性之间具有更好平衡的场景，而且能够更有效地进行驾驶策略的闭环训练。

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过线性模式连接提供了理论基础，并通过大量实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial scenario generation is a cost-effective approach for safety
assessment of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods are often
constrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as
adversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be
steered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate
tailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of
this, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a
multi-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework
named \textbf{S}teerable \textbf{A}dversarial scenario \textbf{GE}nerator
(SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between
adversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose
hierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline
alignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard
feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed
model, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a
continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating
their weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through
the lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and
realism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving
policies. Project page: https://tongnie.github.io/SAGE/.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种受量子理论启发的解决大型语言模型（LLM）推理连贯性问题的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在维持连贯的多步骤推理轨迹方面存在困难，特别是在需要结构化逻辑流程的任务中。

Method: 该方法将基于保真度的奖励（源自投影纠缠对状态（PEPS））纳入近端策略优化中，通过结构一致性来指导学习。

Result: 在GSM8K、StrategyQA和EntailmentBank等数据集上的评估表明，该方法优于监督、对比和预训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，受量子理论启发的保真度可以有效提高LLM中推理轨迹的连贯性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining coherent
multi-step reasoning traces, particularly in tasks that require a structured
logical flow. This work introduces a quantum-inspired approach to address the
challenge by incorporating a fidelity-based reward derived from Projected
Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization. Unlike prior
approaches that use direct supervision or contrastive objectives, the proposed
method guides learning through structural consistency, offering a novel
approach to enforce global coherence in generated reasoning traces. The
proposed framework is evaluated using multiple coherence-determining metrics on
diverse datasets such as GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank spanning
arithmetic, intuitive, and entailment-based reasoning. Results show that the
proposed quantum-inspired approach offers significant improvements over
supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baseline approaches, highlighting the
effectiveness of quantum-inspired fidelity as a foundation to improve reasoning
trace coherence in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在将静态多智能体协同转换为动态的、能力驱动的协作。

Method: 结合了语义路由、动态任务分解和智能聚类三种关键创新。语义路由通过分片HNSW索引将任务与智能体匹配，并通过成本偏差优化来执行操作约束。动态任务分解允许兼容的智能体通过基于共识的合并将复杂任务分解为子任务的DAG。智能聚类将处理相似子任务的智能体分组到协作通道中，以进行k轮细化。

Result: 在HealthBench上的评估表明，FoA比单模型基线提高了13倍，其中聚类增强的协作对于需要多个视角的复杂推理任务特别有效。该系统可以水平扩展，同时保持一致的性能。

Conclusion: 语义编排与结构化协作可以释放异构AI智能体联邦的集体智能。

Abstract: We present Federation of Agents (FoA), a distributed orchestration framework
that transforms static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven
collaboration. FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs):
machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through
semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and
limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic
routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing
operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task
decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks
into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering
that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for
k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe
semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity
through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance.
Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines,
with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex
reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally
while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic
orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective
intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents.

Method: 通过实际硬件部署在混合交通中进行合作车道变换预测。

Result: 强调了面临的实际挑战，包括瓶颈、可靠性问题和影响系统行为的运行限制。

Conclusion: 通过记录这些经验，为从事类似研究的其他人提供指导。

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few
years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation
environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on
simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that
do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change
prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the
practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often
under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction
through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights
that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical
challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational
constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these
experiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的代理框架，以协助解释和执行CT扫描协议配置请求，从而提高工作流程效率并减少技术人员的工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学领域熟练劳动力日益短缺，而CT扫描协议管理（包括调整采集参数、配置重建和选择后处理工具）既耗时又需要临床和技术专业知识。

Method: 该代理结合了上下文学习、指令跟随和结构化工具调用能力，以识别相关的协议元素并应用准确的修改。

Result: 实验结果表明，该代理可以有效地检索协议组件，生成设备兼容的协议定义文件，并忠实地执行用户请求。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，基于LLM的代理在支持CT成像中的扫描协议管理方面具有明确的潜力，但也面临着由于缺乏统一的设备API而导致的句法和语义有效性问题，以及处理模糊或复杂请求的挑战。

Abstract: Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting
acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting
postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and
requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe
an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this
issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist
with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given
in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to
improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent
combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling
abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate
modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that
the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device
compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests.
Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations
regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API,
and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings
show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol
management in CT imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于追逐算法在存在规则下的终止性无法保证，甚至在一般情况下是不可判定的，尤其是在规则应用顺序很重要的受限追逐中。

Method: 通过分析线性多头规则，解决了全实例受限追逐终止的可判定性问题。

Result: 证明了线性多头情形下全实例受限追逐终止是可判定的。

Conclusion: 该研究在解决线性多头规则的全实例受限追逐终止问题上取得了进展。

Abstract: The chase is a ubiquitous algorithm in database theory. However, for
existential rules (aka tuple-generating dependencies), its termination is not
guaranteed, and even undecidable in general. The problem of termination becomes
particularly difficult for the restricted (or standard) chase, for which the
order of rule application matters. Thus, decidability of restricted chase
termination is still open for many well-behaved classes such as linear or
guarded multi-headed rules. We make a step forward by showing that
all-instances restricted chase termination is decidable in the linear
multi-headed case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Text-to-SQL基准测试在问题复杂度上存在局限性，尤其缺乏对复杂分析推理的关注。

Method: 论文提出了Text2SQLCode方法，该方法将任务分解为SQL（用于数据获取）和Python（用于推理）。

Result: 实验结果表明，结合使用SQL和Python比单独使用SQL更有效，但现有LLM在STARQA数据集上仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: STARQA数据集的引入填补了复杂分析推理Text-to-SQL基准测试的空白，Text2SQLCode方法为解决此类问题提供了一种有前景的途径。

Abstract: Semantic parsing methods for converting text to SQL queries enable question
answering over structured data and can greatly benefit analysts who routinely
perform complex analytics on vast data stored in specialized relational
databases. Although several benchmarks measure the abilities of text to SQL,
the complexity of their questions is inherently limited by the level of
expressiveness in query languages and none focus explicitly on questions
involving complex analytical reasoning which require operations such as
calculations over aggregate analytics, time series analysis or scenario
understanding. In this paper, we introduce STARQA, the first public
human-created dataset of complex analytical reasoning questions and answers on
three specialized-domain databases. In addition to generating SQL directly
using LLMs, we evaluate a novel approach (Text2SQLCode) that decomposes the
task into a combination of SQL and Python: SQL is responsible for data
fetching, and Python more naturally performs reasoning. Our results demonstrate
that identifying and combining the abilities of SQL and Python is beneficial
compared to using SQL alone, yet the dataset still remains quite challenging
for the existing state-of-the-art LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关系数据库理论的早期，人们意识到“无环”数据库模式具有许多理想的语义属性。因此，在 20 世纪 80 年代，人们确定并广泛研究了三种不同的“无环性”概念，即 alpha 无环性、beta 无环性和 gamma 无环性。

Method: 研究伽马无环模式和带注释关系

Result: 伽马无环模式的良好语义特性可以扩展到带注释关系，只要注释来自具有传输属性的正交换幺半群。此外，本文的结果揭示了两个标准关系的连接的唯一相关属性是，如果这两个关系是一致的，则它是这两个关系一致性的证明。

Conclusion: 对于带注释关系的更抽象设置，标准连接的此属性由一致性见证函数的概念捕获，我们在这项工作中系统地研究了这一概念。

Abstract: During the early days of relational database theory it was realized that
"acyclic" database schemas possess a number of desirable semantic properties.
In fact, three different notions of "acyclicity" were identified and
extensively investigated during the 1980s, namely, alpha-acyclicity,
beta-acyclicity, and gamma-acyclicity. Much more recently, the study of
alpha-acyclicity was extended to annotated relations, where the annotations are
values from some positive commutative monoid. The recent results about
alpha-acyclic schemas and annotated relations give rise to results about
beta-acyclic schemas and annotated relations, since a schema is beta-acyclic if
and only if every sub-schema of it is alpha-acyclic. Here, we study
gamma-acyclic schemas and annotated relations. Our main finding is that the
desirable semantic properties of gamma-acyclic schemas extend to annotated
relations, provided the annotations come from a positive commutative monoid
that has the transportation property. Furthermore, the results reported here
shed light on the role of the join of two standard relations, Specifically, our
results reveal that the only relevant property of the join of two standard
relations is that it is a witness to the consistency of the two relations,
provided that these two relations are consistent. For the more abstract setting
of annotated relations, this property of the standard join is captured by the
notion of a consistency witness function, a notion which we systematically
investigate in this work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal and real-time database systems lack efficient ingestion, continuous query capability, or expressive hybrid analytics support.

Method: Unified disk-based secondary index on LSM-based storage for vector, spatial, and text data; cost-based query optimizer for hybrid queries; incremental materialized view framework for efficient continuous queries.

Result: ARCADE outperforms leading multimodal data systems by up to 7.4x on read-heavy and 1.4x on write-heavy workloads.

Conclusion: ARCADE is a real-time data system that efficiently supports high-throughput ingestion and expressive hybrid and continuous query processing across diverse data types.

Abstract: The explosive growth of multimodal data - spanning text, image, video,
spatial, and relational modalities, coupled with the need for real-time
semantic search and retrieval over these data - has outpaced the capabilities
of existing multimodal and real-time database systems, which either lack
efficient ingestion and continuous query capability, or fall short in
supporting expressive hybrid analytics. We introduce ARCADE, a real-time data
system that efficiently supports high-throughput ingestion and expressive
hybrid and continuous query processing across diverse data types. ARCADE
introduces unified disk-based secondary index on LSM-based storage for vector,
spatial, and text data modalities, a comprehensive cost-based query optimizer
for hybrid queries, and an incremental materialized view framework for
efficient continuous queries. Built on open-source RocksDB storage and MySQL
query engine, ARCADE outperforms leading multimodal data systems by up to 7.4x

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种输出敏感的算法，用于评估非循环CRPQ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图查询语言中，CRPQ是一个重要的构造。现有的算法复杂度较高，依赖于正则表达式的输出大小，而正则表达式的输出大小可能远大于查询输出大小。

Method: 该算法分两个阶段进行：1. 将给定的查询收缩为一个自由连通的非循环查询，通过组合正则表达式或将绑定变量提升为自由变量来消除绑定变量。2. 评估自由连通的非循环CRPQ，并去除提升的绑定变量的列。通过计算与大小成比例的时间内自由连通的非循环CRPQ中出现的正则表达式的校准输出，确保输出敏感性。

Result: 该算法在查询输出远小于最坏情况输出大小或查询中任何正则表达式的最大输出大小的情况下，比现有方法具有更低的复杂度。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法在特定情况下比现有算法更有效。

Abstract: Conjunctive Regular Path Queries, or CRPQs for short, are an essential
construct in graph query languages. In this paper, we propose the first
output-sensitive algorithm for evaluating acyclic CRPQs. It is output-sensitive
in the sense that its complexity is a function of the sizes of the input graph
and of the query output. In particular, it does not depend on the output sizes
of the regular expressions that appear in the query, as these sizes can be much
larger than the query output size.
  Our algorithm proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, it contracts the
given query into a free-connex acyclic one such that the output of the original
query can be obtained from the output of the contracted one. This contraction
removes bound variables by composing regular expressions or by promoting bound
variables to free ones. The minimum necessary number of promoted bound
variables gives the contraction width, which is a novel parameter specific to
CRPQs. In the second stage, our algorithm evaluates the free-connex acyclic
CRPQ and projects away the columns of the promoted bound variables. It ensures
output-sensitivity by computing the calibrated outputs of the regular
expressions appearing in the free-connex acyclic CRPQ in time proportional to
their sizes.
  Our algorithm has lower complexity than the state-of-the-art approaches for
problem instances where (i) the query output is asymptotically smaller than the
worst-case output size or (ii) the largest output size of any of the regular
expression in the query.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在社交媒体上识别和链接科学声明对于循证事实核查和学术讨论至关重要，但面临词汇稀疏、查询短和领域特定语言的挑战。

Method: 该方法包含一个两阶段检索流程：(1) 使用基于 E5-large 的双编码器进行密集检索，并通过分块分词和丰富的文档元数据进行增强；(2) 使用 SciBERT 交叉编码器进行神经重排序。

Result: 该方法在 gold label blind 测试集上实现了 MRR@5 = 0.6828，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，将密集检索与神经重排序相结合，为 tweet-to-study 匹配提供了一个强大而有效的解决方案，并为未来的证据检索流程提供了一个实用的蓝图。

Abstract: Linking implicit scientific claims made on social media to their original
publications is crucial for evidence-based fact-checking and scholarly
discourse, yet it is hindered by lexical sparsity, very short queries, and
domain-specific language. Team AIRwaves ranked second in Subtask 4b of the
CLEF-2025 CheckThat! Lab with an evidence-retrieval approach that markedly
outperforms the competition baseline. The optimized sparse-retrieval
baseline(BM25) achieves MRR@5 = 0.5025 on the gold label blind test set. To
surpass this baseline, a two-stage retrieval pipeline is introduced: (i) a
first stage that uses a dual encoder based on E5-large, fine-tuned using
in-batch and mined hard negatives and enhanced through chunked tokenization and
rich document metadata; and (ii) a neural re-ranking stage using a SciBERT
cross-encoder. Replacing purely lexical matching with neural representations
lifts performance to MRR@5 = 0.6174, and the complete pipeline further improves
to MRR@5 = 0.6828. The findings demonstrate that coupling dense retrieval with
neural re-rankers delivers a powerful and efficient solution for tweet-to-study
matching and provides a practical blueprint for future evidence-retrieval
pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ContextualRetriever的新型LLM检索器，它直接将对话上下文纳入检索过程，无需额外的推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索器难以理解用户在多轮对话中的意图，尤其是在用户使用缩写和转换话题时。现有的查询重写技术计算成本高，而基于LLM的检索器在跟踪用户意图方面没有明确优化。

Method: ContextualRetriever包含：(1) 上下文感知的嵌入机制，突出显示对话历史记录中的当前查询；(2) 基于高质量重写查询的意图引导监督；(3) 一种保留基础LLM生成能力的训练策略。

Result: 在多个会话搜索基准上的大量评估表明，ContextualRetriever 明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ContextualRetriever在没有额外推理开销的情况下，显著优于现有方法，解决了现有方法在多轮对话中用户意图理解上的局限性。

Abstract: Effective conversational search demands a deep understanding of user intent
across multiple dialogue turns. Users frequently use abbreviations and shift
topics in the middle of conversations, posing challenges for conventional
retrievers. While query rewriting techniques improve clarity, they often incur
significant computational cost due to additional autoregressive steps.
Moreover, although LLM-based retrievers demonstrate strong performance, they
are not explicitly optimized to track user intent in multi-turn settings, often
failing under topic drift or contextual ambiguity. To address these
limitations, we propose ContextualRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever that
directly incorporates conversational context into the retrieval process. Our
approach introduces: (1) a context-aware embedding mechanism that highlights
the current query within the dialogue history; (2) intent-guided supervision
based on high-quality rewritten queries; and (3) a training strategy that
preserves the generative capabilities of the base LLM. Extensive evaluations
across multiple conversational search benchmarks demonstrate that
ContextualRetriever significantly outperforms existing methods while incurring
no additional inference overhead.

Method: 通过基于 transformer 的凸化，联合嵌入属性和向量，将硬过滤器转换为连续的、加权的惩罚，从而保留 top-k 语义，同时实现高效的近似搜索。

Result: 在标准混合基准测试中，FusedANN 提高了查询吞吐量，实现了卓越的召回率-延迟权衡，而无需专门的索引 hacks，与最先进的混合和基于图的系统相比，吞吐量提高了 3 倍，并具有更好的召回率。提供了明确的误差范围和参数选择规则，使 FusedANN 适用于生产。

Conclusion: FusedANN 在符号约束和向量相似性之间建立了一个有原则的、可扩展的和可验证的桥梁，为大型、混合和动态的 NLP/ML 工作负载解锁了新一代的过滤检索系统。

Abstract: Vector search powers transformers technology, but real-world use demands
hybrid queries that combine vector similarity with attribute filters (e.g.,
"top document in category X, from 2023"). Current solutions trade off recall,
speed, and flexibility, relying on fragile index hacks that don't scale. We
introduce FusedANN (Fused Attribute-Vector Nearest Neighbor), a geometric
framework that elevates filtering to ANN optimization constraints and
introduces a convex fused space via a Lagrangian-like relaxation. Our method
jointly embeds attributes and vectors through transformer-based
convexification, turning hard filters into continuous, weighted penalties that
preserve top-k semantics while enabling efficient approximate search. We prove
that FusedANN reduces to exact filtering under high selectivity, gracefully
relaxes to semantically nearest attributes when exact matches are insufficient,
and preserves downstream ANN alpha-approximation guarantees. Empirically,
FusedANN improves query throughput by eliminating brittle filtering stages,
achieving superior recall-latency tradeoffs on standard hybrid benchmarks
without specialized index hacks, delivering up to 3 times higher throughput and
better recall than state-of-the-art hybrid and graph-based systems.
Theoretically, we provide explicit error bounds and parameter selection rules
that make FusedANN practical for production. This establishes a principled,
scalable, and verifiable bridge between symbolic constraints and vector
similarity, unlocking a new generation of filtered retrieval systems for large,
hybrid, and dynamic NLP/ML workloads.

*Qihang Zhao,Xiaoyang Zheng,Ben Chen,Zhongbo Sun,Chenyi Lei*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Contextual Diffusion Purifier (CDP) 的方法，用于从搜索系统中的用户行为序列中提取更纯粹、更具上下文感知性的兴趣表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了噪声和真实兴趣的有机纠缠，并且输出静态的、与上下文无关的表示，无法适应不同Query-User-Item-Context条件下的动态意图转变。

Method: CDP通过将类别过滤的行为视为“受污染的观察”，采用前向加噪和条件反向去噪过程，该过程由交叉交互特征（Query x User x Item x Context）引导，可控地生成纯粹的、上下文感知的兴趣表示。

Result: 大量的离线/在线实验表明，CDP优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: CDP能够有效地从用户行为序列中提取更准确和动态的兴趣表示，优于现有技术。

Abstract: User behavior sequences in search systems resemble "interest fossils",
capturing genuine intent yet eroded by exposure bias, category drift, and
contextual noise. Current methods predominantly follow an "identify-aggregate"
paradigm, assuming sequences immutably reflect user preferences while
overlooking the organic entanglement of noise and genuine interest. Moreover,
they output static, context-agnostic representations, failing to adapt to
dynamic intent shifts under varying Query-User-Item-Context conditions.
  To resolve this dual challenge, we propose the Contextual Diffusion Purifier
(CDP). By treating category-filtered behaviors as "contaminated observations",
CDP employs a forward noising and conditional reverse denoising process guided
by cross-interaction features (Query x User x Item x Context), controllably
generating pure, context-aware interest representations that dynamically evolve
with scenarios. Extensive offline/online experiments demonstrate the
superiority of CDP over state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在BlocksWorld领域，最佳流程将计划正确率从0%提高到80%以上。句法错误显著减少，但语义错误仍然存在。

Conclusion: 当前模型在推理能力上存在根本局限性。

Abstract: Certain strong LLMs have shown promise for zero-shot formal planning by
generating planning languages like PDDL. Yet, performance of most open-source
models under 50B parameters has been reported to be close to zero due to the
low-resource nature of these languages. We significantly improve their
performance via a series of lightweight pipelines that integrates documentation
retrieval with modular code generation and error refinement. With models like
Llama-4-Maverick, our best pipeline improves plan correctness from 0\% to over
80\% on the common BlocksWorld domain. However, while syntactic errors are
substantially reduced, semantic errors persist in more challenging domains,
revealing fundamental limitations in current models' reasoning
capabilities.\footnote{Our code and data can be found at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的联邦推荐方法，旨在解决多模态特征融合在联邦推荐中的效率、分布异质性和细粒度对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保护隐私的前提下，如何将多模态特征融入联邦推荐仍然是一个开放的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种新的联邦推荐中的多模态融合机制（GFMFR）。它将多模态表示学习卸载到服务器，服务器存储项目内容并采用高容量编码器来生成表达性表示，从而减轻客户端开销。此外，一种组感知项目表示融合方法能够实现相似用户之间细粒度的知识共享，同时保留个人偏好。所提出的融合损失可以简单地插入到任何现有的联邦推荐系统中，通过添加多模态特征来增强它们的能力。

Result: 在五个公共基准数据集上进行的大量实验表明，GFMFR 始终优于最先进的多模态 FR 基线。

Conclusion: GFMFR 是一种有效的联邦推荐方法，它能够有效地融合多模态特征，并在保护隐私的前提下提高推荐性能。

Abstract: Federated Recommendation (FR) is a new learning paradigm to tackle the
learn-to-rank problem in a privacy-preservation manner. How to integrate
multi-modality features into federated recommendation is still an open
challenge in terms of efficiency, distribution heterogeneity, and fine-grained
alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal fusion
mechanism in federated recommendation settings (GFMFR). Specifically, it
offloads multimodal representation learning to the server, which stores item
content and employs a high-capacity encoder to generate expressive
representations, alleviating client-side overhead. Moreover, a group-aware item
representation fusion approach enables fine-grained knowledge sharing among
similar users while retaining individual preferences. The proposed fusion loss
could be simply plugged into any existing federated recommender systems
empowering their capability by adding multi-modality features. Extensive
experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFMFR
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal FR baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统被广泛应用，但AI推荐系统的设计方法和“人机结合”范式存在不足，未能充分描述人为监督带来的风险。

Method: 回顾人为监督的局限性如何增加特定类型失败的可能性，并探讨三种常见部署环境的动态性如何使人为监督更容易失败。

Result: 分析了人为监督在推荐系统中可能失效的风险。

Conclusion: 对推荐系统提出两点建议，以应对人为监督的局限性。

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most commonly deployed systems today.
Systems design approaches to AI-powered recommender systems have done well to
urge recommender system developers to follow more intentional data collection,
curation, and management procedures. So too has the "human-in-the-loop"
paradigm been widely adopted, primarily to address the issue of accountability.
However, in this paper, we take the position that human oversight in
recommender system design also entails novel risks that have yet to be fully
described. These risks are "codetermined" by the information context in which
such systems are often deployed. Furthermore, new knowledge of the shortcomings
of "human-in-the-loop" practices to deliver meaningful oversight of other AI
systems suggest that they may also be inadequate for achieving socially
responsible recommendations. We review how the limitations of human oversight
may increase the chances of a specific kind of failure: a "cascade" or
"compound" failure. We then briefly explore how the unique dynamics of three
common deployment contexts can make humans in the loop more likely to fail in
their oversight duties. We then conclude with two recommendations.

*Jarne Mathi Decker*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文研究了推荐系统中算法选择问题，探讨了加入算法特征对元学习器性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有元学习方法将不同的推荐算法视为等同的“黑盒”选择，忽略了算法本身的多样性。

Method: 通过构建综合特征集来显式表征算法，结合静态代码指标、抽象语法树属性、行为性能地标和高级概念特征。

Result: 加入算法特征的元学习器在NDCG@10上比最佳单一算法基线提高了11.7%，但在总体NDCG@10上没有超过仅使用用户特征的元学习器。算法特征提高了Top-1选择准确率，但降低了Top-3准确率。

Conclusion: 对于推荐系统中的用户算法选择任务，用户特征的预测能力占主导地位。算法特征提高了选择精度，但提升整体性能仍然具有挑战性。

Abstract: The "No Free Lunch" theorem dictates that no single recommender algorithm is
optimal for all users, creating a significant Algorithm Selection Problem.
Standard meta-learning approaches aim to solve this by selecting an algorithm
based on user features, but treat the fundamentally diverse algorithms
themselves as equivalent, "black-box" choices. This thesis investigates the
impact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set
to explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code
metrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and
high-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five
datasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both
user and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented
with algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically
significant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline
(0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not
lead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user
features (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did
improve its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by
leading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user
algorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user
features is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection
precision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a
non-trivial challenge.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为多模态表征解耦信息瓶颈 (MRdIB) 的新框架，以增强多模态推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态推荐系统常常受到冗余和不相关信息的干扰，影响性能。现有方法未能充分过滤噪声并建模模态之间复杂的相互作用。

Method: 首先使用多模态信息瓶颈压缩输入表征，过滤掉不相关的噪声，然后将信息分解为独特的、冗余的和协同的成分，并通过一系列约束来优化这些成分。

Result: 在多个模型和三个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，MRdIB 在增强多模态推荐方面的有效性和多功能性。

Conclusion: MRdIB 能够学习更强大和解耦的表征，从而提升多模态推荐效果。

Abstract: Multimodal data has significantly advanced recommendation systems by
integrating diverse information sources to model user preferences and item
characteristics. However, these systems often struggle with redundant and
irrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods
either fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural
separation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model
the complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled
Information Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal
Information Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively
filtering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information.
Then, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the
recommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We
achieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information
learning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information
learning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning
objective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives,
MRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations.
Extensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in
enhancing multimodal recommendation.

Motivation: 社交媒体平台上的对话提供了观察音乐互动的空间，而自然语言处理和大数据分析的发展使得大规模分析这些讨论成为可能。Reddit的匿名性鼓励了多样化的参与和丰富的音乐讨论。

Method: 开发了一个名为Muse-it的平台，可以从Reddit检索数据，支持主题建模、时间趋势分析和聚类，并识别音乐相关的超链接，检索音轨元数据，以及提供互动界面。

Conclusion: Muse-it为音乐研究者提供了一种易于访问的方式来收集和分析大数据，从而开启了理解在线音乐互动的新途径。

Abstract: Music engagement spans diverse interactions with music, from selection and
emotional response to its impact on behavior, identity, and social connections.
Social media platforms provide spaces where such engagement can be observed in
natural, unprompted conversations. Advances in natural language processing
(NLP) and big data analytics make it possible to analyze these discussions at
scale, extending music research to broader contexts. Reddit, in particular,
offers anonymity that encourages diverse participation and yields rich
discourse on music in ecological settings. Yet the scale of this data requires
tools to extract, process, and analyze it effectively. We present Muse-it, a
platform that retrieves comprehensive Reddit data centered on user-defined
queries. It aggregates posts from across subreddits, supports topic modeling,
temporal trend analysis, and clustering, and enables efficient study of
large-scale discourse. Muse-it also identifies music-related hyperlinks (e.g.,
Spotify), retrieves track-level metadata such as artist, album, release date,
genre, popularity, and lyrics, and links these to the discussions. An
interactive interface provides dynamic visualizations of the collected data.
Muse-it thus offers an accessible way for music researchers to gather and
analyze big data, opening new avenues for understanding music engagement as it
naturally unfolds online.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于扩散的强化学习框架，该框架集成了离散小波变换，以将轨迹分解为低频和高频分量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要集中在时域特征上，而忽略了频域特征，导致频移和性能下降。

Method: 提出 Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser)，一种新颖的基于扩散的 RL 框架，该框架集成了离散小波变换，以将轨迹分解为低频和高频分量。为了进一步增强每个分量的扩散建模，WFDiffuser 采用短时傅里叶变换和交叉注意机制来提取频域特征并促进跨频率交互。

Result: 在 D4RL 基准上的大量实验结果表明，WFDiffuser 有效地减轻了频移，从而产生了更平滑、更稳定的轨迹，并提高了优于现有方法的决策性能。

Conclusion: WFDiffuser 通过减轻频移，产生更平滑、更稳定的轨迹，并提高了决策性能。

Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline
reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However,
existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking
frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance
according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from
a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that
time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency
components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and
degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier
Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates
Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and
high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each
component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention
mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency
interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate
that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother,
more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing
methods.

Conclusion: 该论文探讨了反洗钱工作的前景，并提出整合深度学习和中心性算法等新兴技术，以提高反洗钱系统的效力。

Abstract: In this paper, we focused on using deep learning methods for detecting money
laundering in financial transaction networks, in order to demonstrate that it
can be used as a complement or instead of the more commonly used rule-based
systems and conventional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. The paper
explores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in
the global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML
systems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the
sophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these
challenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link
analysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the
utilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness
Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the
system's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the
influence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The
significance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial
sector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional
AML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new
implementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively
structured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the
context of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the
prospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of
emerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This
integration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by
refining their capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的特征归因方法（如 Integrated Gradients 或 SHAP）计算密集，不适合实时应用。

Method: 提出了一种反向加权聚合方案，该方案强调 LSTM 网络中跨时间步的激活的稳定性和幅度。

Result: 在三个生物特征注视数据集上的评估表明，DeepACTIF 不仅在严重特征减少（前 10% 的特征）的情况下保持了预测性能，而且在准确性和统计稳健性方面显着优于已建立的方法，包括 SHAP、IG 和 DeepLIFT。

Conclusion: DeepACTIF 不仅减少了计算时间和内存使用，而且在使用排名靠前的特征时保持了模型准确性，使其成为移动 XR 头显或嵌入式健康监视器等边缘设备上实时可解释性的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Feature attribution is essential for interpreting deep learning models,
particularly in time-series domains such as healthcare, biometrics, and
human-AI interaction. However, standard attribution methods, such as Integrated
Gradients or SHAP, are computationally intensive and not well-suited for
real-time applications. We present DeepACTIF, a lightweight and
architecture-aware feature attribution method that leverages internal
activations of sequence models to estimate feature importance efficiently.
Focusing on LSTM-based networks, we introduce an inverse-weighted aggregation
scheme that emphasises stability and magnitude of activations across time
steps. Our evaluation across three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF
not only preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction (top
10% of features) but also significantly outperforms established methods,
including SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT, in terms of both accuracy and statistical
robustness. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and effect size analysis, we
demonstrate that DeepACTIF yields more informative feature rankings with
significantly lower error across all top-k conditions (10 - 40%). Our
experiments demonstrate that DeepACTIF not only reduces computation time and
memory usage by orders of magnitude but also preserves model accuracy when
using only top-ranked features. That makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for
real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or
embedded health monitors.

Motivation: 信用卡欺诈日益严重，对美国家庭的财务状况构成重大威胁，导致家庭经济行为发生不可预测的变化。

Method: 该模型采用多分辨率小波分解模块和时间注意力机制，对历史交易数据和宏观经济指标进行离散小波变换，生成局部经济冲击信号。然后，将转换后的特征输入到基于Takagi-Sugeno模糊规则和自适应高斯隶属函数的深度模糊规则库中。该模型提出了一个时间注意力编码器，自适应地为多尺度经济行为模式分配权重，提高模糊推理阶段相关性评估的有效性，并增强对欺诈活动引起的长期时间依赖性和异常的捕获。

Result: 实验结果表明，与局部神经模糊模型和传统LSTM模型相比，RMSE降低了17.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模块化训练程序，将模糊规则激活与小波基选择和时间相关权重相结合，不同于具有固定输入输出关系的经典ANFIS。

Abstract: Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the
financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in
household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid
analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes
several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a
multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention
mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical
transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic
shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule
library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian
membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that
adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns,
increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference
stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and
anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from
classical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates
fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal
correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show
that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and
conventional LSTM models.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of unsupervised outlier detection
methods in audit analytics, utilizing USA spending data from the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as a case example. We employ and
compare multiple outlier detection algorithms, including Histogram-based
Outlier Score (HBOS), Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum

involves data preparation, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation
using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results indicate that a hybrid

accuracy of outlier identification in complex financial data. This study
contributes to the field of audit analytics by providing insights into the

Abstract: We critically assess the efficacy of the current SOTA in hallucination

requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Out-of-distribution

Abstract: Despite their widespread applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often

standard baseline methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities
produce overconfident and poorly calibrated estimates. In this work, we propose
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference,
based approach that treats LLMs as a stochastic simulator to infer posterior
distributions over predictive probabilities. We evaluate our ABC approach on
two clinically relevant benchmarks: a synthetic oral lesion diagnosis dataset
and the publicly available GretelAI symptom-to-diagnosis dataset. Compared to
standard baselines, our approach improves accuracy by up to 46.9\%, reduces
Brier scores by 74.4\%, and enhances calibration as measured by Expected
Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy.

Motivation: 在现实世界的应用中，专家动作通常难以获得，因此需要研究仅通过专家状态信息进行模仿学习的方法。

Method: 本文提出了一个 LfO 框架，并使用该框架对现有的 LfO 方法进行分类。

Result: 本文对现有 LfO 方法进行了梳理，并将其与离线强化学习、基于模型的强化学习和分层强化学习等相关领域联系起来。

Conclusion: 本文使用提出的框架来识别开放性问题，并提出了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms offer an efficient way to train an agent
by mimicking an expert's behavior without requiring a reward function. IL
algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert
demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance,
requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world
applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this
limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only
imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator
only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we
present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO
methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's
design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related
fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our
framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The independent low-rank matrices in LoRA are not efficient, and existing joint, tensor-based adaptations are limited.

Method: The paper introduces TensLoRA, a unified framework that aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. It generalizes existing tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates.

Result: Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that the tensor construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA under similar parameter counts.

Conclusion: TensLoRA improves performance compared to standard LoRA under similar parameter counts.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers
by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While
effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention
projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have
considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and
without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that
aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of
tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing
tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing
parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task.
Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor
construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA

a modular framework designed around decoupling and clear separation of concerns
for configuration, orchestration, communication, and training logic. Its

mixed communication protocols within a single deployment, and popular training
algorithms. It also offers optional privacy mechanisms including Differential
Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Aggregation (SA), as well
as compression strategies. These capabilities are exposed through well-defined
extension points, allowing users to customize topology and orchestration,
learning logic, and privacy/compression plugins, all while preserving the
integrity of the core system. We evaluate multiple models and algorithms to
measure various performance metrics. By unifying topology configuration,
mixed-protocol communication, and pluggable modules in one stack, OmniFed

TL;DR: TimeMosaic: a new framework for multivariate time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting.

Method: TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder.

Result: TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

Conclusion: TimeMosaic is effective for multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance,
transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods
typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of
local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such
designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in
stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term
and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that
aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch
embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information
density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving
temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that
treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to
horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying
a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing
methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion
observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种处理信用违约预测中类别不平衡问题的技术：SMOTE、SMOTE-Tomek 和 ADASYN。使用真实世界的数据集，研究评估了各种机器学习模型，包括集成 boosting 算法。结果表明，Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM 分类器在信用违约环境中优于其他机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信用违约数据集通常是倾斜的，违约者占的比例远小于非违约者。研究旨在通过比较不同的重采样技术和机器学习模型，为创建更具弹性和适应性的信用违约系统奠定基础。

Method: 该研究首先在没有任何重采样的情况下，在不平衡的数据上评估机器学习模型，以建立基线性能。然后，研究探索了高级集成 boosting 算法（包括 XGBoost、AdaBoost、GBM 和 Light GBM）的适用性，并结合 Boruta 特征选择和基于 DBSCAN 的异常值检测，在重采样前后进行比较。使用来自 University of Cleveland ML Repository 的真实世界信用违约数据集构建 ML 分类器，并测试它们的性能。采用 ROC-AUC、PR-AUC、G-mean 和 F1-scores 作为模型性能的衡量标准。

Result: Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM 分类器优于其他 ML 模型（F1-score：82.56%，G-mean：82.98%，ROC-AUC：90.90%，PR-AUC：91.85%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来创建更具弹性和适应性的信用违约系统奠定了基础，这对于信用交易在全球范围内持续增长至关重要。

Abstract: This study examines credit default prediction by comparing three techniques,
namely SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, that are commonly used to address the
class imbalance problem in credit default situations. Recognizing that credit
default datasets are typically skewed, with defaulters comprising a much
smaller proportion than non-defaulters, we began our analysis by evaluating
machine learning (ML) models on the imbalanced data without any resampling to
establish baseline performance. These baseline results provide a reference
point for understanding the impact of subsequent balancing methods. In addition
to traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
our study also explores the suitability of advanced ensemble boosting
algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, Gradient
Boosting Machines (GBM), and Light GBM for credit default prediction using
Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection, both before and
after resampling. A real-world credit default data set sourced from the
University of Cleveland ML Repository was used to build ML classifiers, and
their performances were tested. The criteria chosen to measure model
performance are the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC-AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), G-mean, and
F1-scores. The results from this empirical study indicate that the
Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier outperformed the other ML models
(F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in a credit
default context. The findings establish a foundation for future progress in
creating more resilient and adaptive credit default systems, which will be
essential as credit-based transactions continue to rise worldwide.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究评估了最先进的统计和深度学习概率预测模型在德国电力价格预测中的不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数模型无法捕捉到不确定性的全部范围，这些不确定性不仅来自数据本身，还来自模型和分布选择。

Method: 研究考虑了深度分布神经网络 (DDNN)，并通过集成方法、蒙特卡洛 (MC) dropout 和共形预测来增强它们，以解决模型不确定性。此外，还考虑了 LASSO 估计的自回归 (LEAR) 方法，并结合分位数回归平均 (QRA)、广义自回归条件异方差 (GARCH) 和共形预测。

Result: 研究发现，基于 LEAR 的模型在概率预测方面表现良好，与不确定性量化方法无关。此外，发现 DDNN 受益于结合数据和模型不确定性，从而提高了点预测和概率预测。使用共形预测的模型似乎能够最好地捕捉不确定性本身。

Conclusion: 总的来说，这项广泛的研究表明，所有考虑的模型都具有竞争力。然而，它们的相对性能取决于点预测和概率预测的指标选择。

Abstract: Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management,
and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for
this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of
uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent
of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model
and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty
quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic
forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In
particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment
them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal
prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the
LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile
regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of
performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms
of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification
method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data
and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting.
Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal
prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under
consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance
depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的方法，用于验证、评估和风险评估深度学习系统，通过显式建模运行时分布偏移的发生率来实现更准确的性能估计和可操作的风险评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在基准测试中表现出色，但在实际部署中，由于对输入数据中微小且难以察觉的分布偏移的敏感性，常常表现不佳。这些偏移在实际场景中很常见，但在评估过程中很少被考虑，导致性能指标虚高。

Method: 该方法通过估计分布外检测器输出的概率来显式建模运行时分布偏移的发生率，并将其与网络正确性的条件概率结合，构建成二叉树。通过遍历该树，可以计算出可信且精确的网络准确率估计。

Result: 在五个不同的数据集上评估了该方法，模拟了不同频率分布偏移的部署条件。该方法始终优于传统评估，准确率估计误差通常在 0.01 到 0.1 之间。在医疗分割基准测试中，展示了该方法在风险评估方面的潜力，通过将成本与树节点相关联，为成本效益分析和价值判断提供信息。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个强大的框架，通过提供更准确的性能估计和可操作的风险评估，从而提高深度学习系统的可靠性和可信度，尤其是在安全关键型应用中。

Abstract: Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks
often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often
imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These
shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during
evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we
propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk
assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the
incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability
from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with
conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary
tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of
network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which
we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of
distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional
evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and
0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical
segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by
associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and
value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for
improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems,
particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate
performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

Motivation: 为了解决当前 CFTL 基准测试实践的局限性，例如过度依赖小规模评估数据集、样本量处理不当、报告次优统计模型以及未能考虑预训练和测试数据集之间重叠的风险。

Method: 我们统一重新实现了广泛采用的神经预测网络，使其适应 CFTL 设置；我们仅在专有和合成数据上进行预训练，注意防止测试泄漏；并且我们在 15 个大型、多样化的公共预测竞赛数据集上进行评估。

Result: 统计模型的准确性经常被低估。统计模型及其集成在 sCRPS 中始终优于现有 FFM 8.2% 以上，在 MASE 中优于 20% 以上。合成数据集预训练确实将 FFM 的准确度提高了 7%。

Conclusion: 统计模型优于现有的FFM，合成数据集预训练可以提高 FFM 的准确度。

Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework
for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation
forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current
benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This
shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation
datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary
statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account
for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To
address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of
widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup;
we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent
test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition
datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is
frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their
ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and
by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic
dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

Result: 建立了分析后验估计，并提供了与已建立的惩罚策略的经验比较，从而分析了热力学一致的PINN扩展方法。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的PINNs公式，其中选择惩罚项来惩罚不可能的偏差，而不是凭经验选择。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models
aiming to approximate solutions of PDEs by training neural networks to minimize
the residual of the equation. Focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems,
we propose a physically informed choice of penalization that is consistent with
the underlying fluctuation structure, as characterized by a large deviations
principle. This approach yields a novel formulation of PINNs in which the
penalty term is chosen to penalize improbable deviations, rather than being
selected heuristically. The resulting thermodynamically consistent extension of
PINNs, termed THINNs, is subsequently analyzed by establishing analytical a
posteriori estimates, and providing empirical comparisons to established
penalization strategies.

Motivation: 多元时间序列数据的Transformer模型在变量计数方面存在可扩展性瓶颈，且不加区分的变量间混合可能导致噪声累积和性能下降。

Result: DELTAformer在变量计数方面实现了线性扩展，并在基准测试中优于标准Transformer，实现了最先进的性能。它还能在嘈杂的多元时间序列环境中更好地关注相关信号，并表现出卓越的抗噪能力。

Conclusion: 通过利用多元时间序列中的领域特定挑战，DELTAformer能够同时实现线性扩展，并提高其性能。

Abstract: Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer
modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing
consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a
potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is
likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many
MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from
indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While
scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in
transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by
strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable
mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention
(DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate
tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal
modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model
to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to
propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales
linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard
transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and
baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than
standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior
noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by
aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our
advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually
improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.

Motivation: 现有的合理CE方法计算成本高昂，因为它们的优化模型引入了大量的约束。

Method: 论文改进了DACE框架，并提出了一个改进的混合整数线性规划（MILP）公式，该公式显著减少了局部离群因子（LOF）目标组件中的约束数量。该方法还应用于具有标准缩放器的线性SVM分类器。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持解释质量的同时，实现了更快的求解速度。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，更有效的LOF建模在反事实解释和数据科学应用中具有前景。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is a widely used post-hoc method that
provides individuals with actionable changes to alter an unfavorable prediction
from a machine learning model. Plausible CE methods improve realism by
considering data distribution characteristics, but their optimization models
introduce a large number of constraints, leading to high computational cost. In
this work, we revisit the DACE framework and propose a refined Mixed-Integer
Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that significantly reduces the number of
constraints in the local outlier factor (LOF) objective component. We also
apply the method to a linear SVM classifier with standard scaler. The
experimental results show that our approach achieves faster solving times while
maintaining explanation quality. These results demonstrate the promise of more
efficient LOF modeling in counterfactual explanation and data science
applications.

Motivation: 现有分子生成方法需要在严格等变性和可扩展性/灵活性之间做出权衡。

Method: 提出了三种变体：全局框架扩散 (GFD)、局部框架扩散 (LFD) 和不变框架扩散 (IFD)，并结合 EdgeDiT (具有边缘感知注意力的扩散 Transformer) 来增强表达能力。

Result: GFD 与 EdgeDiT 在 QM9 数据集上取得了最先进的性能，测试 NLL 为 -137.97 (标准尺度) 和 -141.85 (双倍尺度)，原子稳定性和分子稳定性分别为 98.98% 和 90.51%。

Conclusion: 基于框架的扩散是一种可扩展、灵活且物理基础坚实的分子生成范式，强调了全局结构保持的关键作用。

Abstract: Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce
strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability
and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves
deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the
backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global
Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame
Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from
additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which
relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity,
we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.
  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale,
alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These
results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and
uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study
establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically
grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of
global structure preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经代理通常注入能量并破坏长时程展开的稳定性。MCFM 将保守-耗散分解构建到向量场和结构保持采样器中。

Method: MCFM 通过条件流匹配在短过渡上进行训练，避免了长展开伴随。在推理中，Strang-prox 方案交替进行辛更新和近端度量步骤，确保离散能量衰减。可选的投影在可信能量可用时强制严格衰减。

Result: 在受控机械基准测试中，MCFM 产生了更接近真实值的相图，并且比同等表达的无约束神经流产生更少的能量增加和正能量率事件，同时匹配终端分布拟合。

Conclusion: MCFM 能够在学习耗散动力学时保证能量衰减和稳定展开，并在机械基准测试中表现出优于无约束神经流的性能。

Abstract: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) learns dissipative dynamics
without violating first principles. Neural surrogates often inject energy and
destabilize long-horizon rollouts; MCFM instead builds the
conservative-dissipative split into both the vector field and a structure
preserving sampler. MCFM trains via conditional flow matching on short
transitions, avoiding long rollout adjoints. In inference, a Strang-prox scheme
alternates a symplectic update with a proximal metric step, ensuring discrete
energy decay; an optional projection enforces strict decay when a trusted
energy is available. We provide continuous and discrete time guarantees linking
this parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and
stable rollouts. On a controlled mechanical benchmark, MCFM yields phase
portraits closer to ground truth and markedly fewer energy-increase and
positive energy rate events than an equally expressive unconstrained neural
flow, while matching terminal distributional fit.

Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的世界模型通常不能直接生成动作，限制了其与依赖单步时序差分学习的离线强化学习算法的兼容性。联合建模状态、奖励和动作会增加训练复杂性并降低性能。

Method: DAWM 模型生成条件为当前状态、动作和剩余回报的未来状态-奖励轨迹，并结合逆动力学模型进行动作推断。这种模块化设计生成完整的合成转移，适用于单步时序差分离线强化学习。

Result: 在 D4RL 基准测试中，使用 DAWM 增强的轨迹训练的保守离线强化学习算法（如 TD3BC 和 IQL）显著优于先前的基于扩散的基线方法。

Conclusion: DAWM 是一种有效的世界模型，可以生成高质量的合成数据，从而提高离线强化学习算法的性能，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement
learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions
alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard
value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference
(TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards,
and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased
training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose
\textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward
trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired
with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This
modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step
TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training.
Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and
IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories,
consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple
tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本论文探讨了深度学习模型随时间的学习过程，利用了受力分析的思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具体来说，我们深入研究模型的训练过程，观察一个训练样本如何在学习过程中影响另一个训练样本，就像分析力如何移动物体一样。

Method: 我们将这种影响分为两个部分：两个样本的相似程度以及更新力的强度。

Result: 这个框架帮助我们理解各种真实系统中模型的广泛行为。例如，它解释了为什么某些例子具有非平凡的学习路径，为什么（以及为什么不）某些LLM微调方法有效，以及为什么更简单、更结构化的模式更容易被学习。

Conclusion: 虽然该方法仍在开发中，但它提供了一种系统地解释模型行为的新方法。

Abstract: This thesis explores how deep learning models learn over time, using ideas
inspired by force analysis. Specifically, we zoom in on the model's training
procedure to see how one training example affects another during learning, like
analyzing how forces move objects. We break this influence into two parts: how
similar the two examples are, and how strong the updating force is. This
framework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in
different real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have
non-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work,
and why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We
apply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for
improving model training. While the method is still developing, it offers a new
way to interpret models' behaviors systematically.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化学习框架，该框架结合了系统组合结构的先验知识，从系统的输入/输出数据中识别组成模块的输入/输出函数，与没有组合结构知识的情况相比，减少了所需的数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在包括合成生物学在内的多个应用中，通常具有关于由许多模块组成的系统的输入/输出数据，并且尽管模块的输入/输出函数和信号可能是未知的，但是组合体系结构的知识可以显着减少学习系统输入/输出映射所需的训练数据量。学习模块的输入/输出函数对于从不同的组合体系结构设计新系统也是必要的。

Method: 引入了模块可识别性的概念，该概念允许从系统输入/输出数据的子集中恢复模块的输入/输出函数，并为受基因线路激励的一类系统提供理论保证。

Result: 在计算研究中证明了该理论，表明考虑了组合结构的神经网络 (NNET) 可以学习组成模块的输入/输出函数，并预测训练集分布之外的输入的系统输出。相比之下，与结构无关的神经网络无法预测落在训练集分布之外的输入。

Conclusion: 通过减少对实验数据的需求并允许模块识别，该框架有潜力简化合成生物电路和更通用的多模块系统的设计。

Abstract: In several applications, including in synthetic biology, one often has
input/output data on a system composed of many modules, and although the
modules' input/output functions and signals may be unknown, knowledge of the
composition architecture can significantly reduce the amount of training data
required to learn the system's input/output mapping. Learning the modules'
input/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from
different composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning
framework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional
structure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from
the system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount
of data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the
compositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular
identifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from
a subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees
on a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory
on computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for
the compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output
functions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set
distribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure
is unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set
distribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module
identification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of
synthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个机器学习框架，用于预测抗体从一种形式转换为另一种形式是否会成功，从而应对现代治疗性抗体设计中的工程挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代治疗性抗体设计通常涉及组合来自不同来源或独立设计的多个功能域，但这些复杂形式可能导致功能和稳定性问题，以及难以合成。

Method: 该框架结合了抗体序列和结构背景，并采用反映实际部署场景的评估协议。

Result: 实验结果表明，大型预训练蛋白语言模型（PLM）的表现不如简单的、特定领域的、多模态表示。

Conclusion: 最佳多模态模型在最具挑战性的“新抗体，无数据”场景中实现了高预测准确率，能够优先选择有希望的候选抗体，并减少浪费的实验工作。

Abstract: Modern therapeutic antibody design often involves composing multi-part
assemblages of individual functional domains, each of which may be derived from
a different source or engineered independently. While these complex formats can
expand disease applicability and improve safety, they present a significant
engineering challenge: the function and stability of individual domains are not
guaranteed in the novel format, and the entire molecule may no longer be
synthesizable. To address these challenges, we develop a machine learning
framework to predict "reformatting success" -- whether converting an antibody
from one format to another will succeed or not. Our framework incorporates both
antibody sequence and structural context, incorporating an evaluation protocol
that reflects realistic deployment scenarios. In experiments on a real-world
antibody reformatting dataset, we find the surprising result that large
pretrained protein language models (PLMs) fail to outperform simple,
domain-tailored, multimodal representations. This is particularly evident in
the most difficult evaluation setting, where we test model generalization to a
new starting antibody. In this challenging "new antibody, no data" scenario,
our best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, enabling
prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的深度哈希方法，可以减少信息损失，并在时间序列索引方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Indexing time series by creating compact binary representations is a
fundamental task in time series data mining. Recently, deep learning-based
hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on
semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing
is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash
codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised
representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a
discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes,
but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a
von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data
to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss
and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The
designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF
distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each
semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/jmpq97/vmf-hashing

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mamba模型的注意力机制在处理长文本时性能下降，因为其状态空间动态的参数化方式导致了泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的注意力机制复杂度高，Mamba等状态空间模型应运而生，但Mamba在长文本上的表现会显著下降。

Method: 通过分析状态转移矩阵A的谱，研究了Mamba模型在长文本上的泛化问题，并提出了谱缩放方法。

Result: 谱缩放方法能够有效提升Mamba模型在长文本上的性能，即使在调整Δt失败的情况下也能生效。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了状态转移矩阵A的谱在长文本泛化中的作用，并为改进具有结构化转移矩阵的状态空间模型的长文本泛化能力提供了新途径。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformer models has
motivated the development of alternative architectures with sub-quadratic
scaling, such as state-space models. Among these, Mamba has emerged as a
leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of
language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly
deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during
pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension.
Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the
out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within
the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent
works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of
discretization time steps, $\exp(-\sum_{t=1}^N\Delta_t)$, we establish a
connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches
infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$, offering a
well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome
this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to
pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by
selectively modulating the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We
show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply
modulating $\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for
better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition
matrices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TIMED的统一生成框架，用于生成高质量的合成时间序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实数据可能稀缺、嘈杂或收集成本高昂，因此生成高质量的合成时间序列至关重要。

Method: TIMED集成了去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）、教师强制训练的监督网络和Wasserstein评论家，并结合了最大平均差异（MMD）损失。

Result: 在多个多元时间序列基准测试中，TIMED生成了比最先进的生成模型更真实和时间上连贯的序列。

Conclusion: TIMED能够有效捕获时间序列数据的无条件和条件方面。

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet
challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection,
where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data
generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal
distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that
govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework
that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture
global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network
trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through
next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial
feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real
and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All
components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for
sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both
unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results
across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED
generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than
state-of-the-art generative models.

Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法在全球气象站预测中忽略或单向建模空间相关性，这与全球天气系统观测的内在性质相矛盾，限制了预测性能。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的空间结构注意块。它将空间图划分为一组子图，并实例化子图内注意来学习每个子图内的局部空间相关性，并将节点聚合到子图表示中，以便通过子图间注意在子图之间传递消息——同时考虑空间邻近性和全局相关性。在此基础上，我们通过逐步扩大子图规模，开发了一种多尺度时空预测模型。

Conclusion: 本文提出的模型是可扩展的，并且能够产生结构化的空间相关性，同时易于实现。

Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research
area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series
forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation
when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the
intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting
forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured
Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of
subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial
correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph
representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph
Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation.
Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting
model by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both
scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it
is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve
performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at
low running costs.

Abstract: The surge in the significance of time series in digital health domains
necessitates advanced methodologies for extracting meaningful patterns and
representations. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a
promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series
data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept
drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning
model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused
by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework
that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol
representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts,
and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding
deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We
demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better
performance where significant data shifting exists.

Abstract: Distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) is a
fundamental and challenging task. Significant progresses have been made on
categorical data. However, due to different evaluation metrics, these methods
do not work well when transferred to numerical data. In particular, we need to
prevent the probability mass from being misplaced far away. In this paper, we
propose a new approach that express the sample distribution using wavelet
expansions. The coefficients of wavelet series are estimated under LDP. Our
method prioritizes the estimation of low-order coefficients, in order to ensure
accurate estimation at macroscopic level. Therefore, the probability mass is
prevented from being misplaced too far away from its ground truth. We establish
theoretical guarantees for our methods. Experiments show that our wavelet
expansion method significantly outperforms existing solutions under Wasserstein
and KS distances.

Method: 利用出院总结推导出每个CXR标签的“先验”或“测试前”概率，以此作为临床医生在解读CXR时可用的背景知识的代理。

Result: CXR模型在先验概率非常低的情况下表现最好，而在先验概率较高的情况下表现明显较差。在平衡测试集中，模型性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: 利用从临床笔记中提取的背景信息进行分析，是更严格、更细致地评估临床视觉模型的一个有希望的方向。

Abstract: Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular
benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong
average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is
insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical
context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic
evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR
diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a
``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for
existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs.
Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several
diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test
probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test
probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether
strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an
ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that
performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not
exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives
from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis,
using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more
rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models.

Motivation: 现有的基于prompt的联邦持续学习方法容易出现客户端之间prompt的类知识一致性问题，这包括类内分布差距和类间相关性，会加剧知识冲突，导致时空遗忘。

Method: 提出了类感知客户端知识交互（C2Prompt）方法，该方法通过引入局部类分布补偿机制（LCDC）来减少类内分布差异，并通过类感知prompt聚合方案（CPA）来缓解类间知识混淆。

Result: 在多个FCL基准测试中，C2Prompt取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: C2Prompt方法通过显式地增强类知识一致性，有效地解决了联邦持续学习中的时空遗忘问题。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from
continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key
challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial
forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown
advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we
underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise
knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge
coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across
clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt
class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During
prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge
conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts,
intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we
propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method
that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt
communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism
(LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across
clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a
class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate
inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant
knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our

Result: 所提出的逐层调度器能够稳定训练并提高准确率，适用于CReLU、Wasserstein正则化和L2权重衰减。

Conclusion: 本文提出的指标和调度器能够有效解决持续学习中的trainability损失问题。

Abstract: Loss of trainability (LoT) in continual learning occurs when gradient steps
no longer yield improvement as tasks evolve, so accuracy stalls or degrades
despite adequate capacity and supervision. We analyze LoT incurred with Adam
through an optimization lens and find that single indicators such as Hessian
rank, sharpness level, weight or gradient norms, gradient-to-parameter ratios,
and unit-sign entropy are not reliable predictors. Instead we introduce two
complementary criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature
volatility-controlled bound that combine into a per-layer predictive threshold
that anticipates trainability behavior. Using this threshold, we build a simple
per-layer scheduler that keeps each layers effective step below a safe limit,
stabilizing training and improving accuracy across concatenated ReLU (CReLU),
Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learned learning-rate
trajectories that mirror canonical decay.

Conclusion: 该研究表明，仅通过训练来修补缺失块的transformer能够隐式地发现一种统一的、资源自适应的迭代求解器，这突出了上下文学习的强大能力。

Abstract: We train a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix
completion tasks: each prompt is masked low-rank matrix whose missing block may
be (i) a scalar prediction target or (ii) an unseen kernel slice of Nystr\"om
extrapolation. The model sees only input-output pairs and a mean-squared loss;
it is given no normal equations, no handcrafted iterations, and no hint that
the tasks are related. Surprisingly, after training, algebraic unrolling
reveals the same parameter-free update rule across three distinct computational
regimes (full visibility, rank-limited updates, and distributed computation).
We prove that this rule achieves second-order convergence on full-batch
problems, cuts distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate with
rank-limited attention. Thus, a transformer trained solely to patch missing
blocks implicitly discovers a unified, resource-adaptive iterative solver
spanning prediction, estimation, and Nystr\"om extrapolation, highlighting a
powerful capability of in-context learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于估计个体化治疗效果 (ITE) 的多任务元学习框架 X-MultiTask，该框架将每个手术决策建模为一个独立的任务，同时学习跨任务的共享表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法难以处理复杂、异构的数据，导致个体化治疗效果 (ITE) 的准确估计仍然有限。

Method: 开发了一个多任务元学习框架 X-MultiTask，用于 ITE 估计，该框架将每个手术决策建模为一个独立的任务，同时学习跨任务的共享表示。为了加强因果有效性，我们将逆概率加权 (IPW) 纳入训练目标。

Result: 在公开的脊柱融合数据集上，模型在 anterior 组中实现了最高的平均 AUC (0.84)，并在 posterior 组中保持了具有竞争力的性能 (0.77)。在治疗效果估计方面，优于基线，具有最低的总体 $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ (0.2778) 和 $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763)。同样，在预测 AIS 中的 PRO 时，X-MultiTask 在所有领域都表现出卓越的性能，$\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 和 $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902。

Conclusion: X-MultiTask 提供了一个强大的工具，可以推进个性化手术护理并改善患者预后。

Abstract: Surgical decision-making is complex and requires understanding causal
relationships between patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. In
high-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate
estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to
the reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex,
heterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning
framework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision
(e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct
task while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal
validity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the
training objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public
spinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs.
posterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset
(368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs.
non-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves
the highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive
performance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in
treatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$
(0.2778) and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs
in AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains,
with $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902.
By providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a
powerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient
outcomes. The code is available at https://github.com/Wizaaard/X-MultiTask.

Abstract: This research presents a novel method for noninvasive arterial blood pressure
ABP prediction using speech signals employing a BERT based regression model
Arterial blood pressure is a vital indicator of cardiovascular health and
accurate monitoring is essential in preventing hypertension related
complications Traditional cuff based methods often yield inconsistent results
due to factors like whitecoat and masked hypertension Our approach leverages
the acoustic characteristics of speech capturing voice features to establish
correlations with blood pressure levels Utilizing advanced deep learning
techniques we analyze speech signals to extract relevant patterns enabling real
time monitoring without the discomfort of conventional methods In our study we
employed a dataset comprising recordings from 95 participants ensuring diverse

leading to impressive performance metrics achieving a mean absolute error MAE
of 136 mmHg for systolic blood pressure SBP and 124 mmHg for diastolic blood
pressure DBP with R scores of 099 and 094 respectively These results indicate
the models robustness in accurately predicting blood pressure levels
Furthermore the training and validation loss analysis demonstrates effective

Conclusion: 该约束保持了批量约束的简单性，并提供了外推误差的直观物理解释。

Abstract: We draw an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and
extrapolation error in off-policy RL, and use it to formulate a constraint that
prevents the policy from drifting toward unsupported actions. In this study, we
present Frictional Q-learning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for
continuous control, which extends batch-constrained reinforcement learning. Our
algorithm constrains the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to
that in the replay buffer, while maintaining a distance from the manifold of
the orthonormal action space. The constraint preserves the simplicity of
batch-constrained, and provides an intuitive physical interpretation of
extrapolation error. Empirically, we further demonstrate that our algorithm is
robustly trained and achieves competitive performance across standard
continuous control benchmarks.

Conclusion: 索博列夫训练可以加速 ReLU 网络的收敛，并且其优势可以扩展到现代深度学习任务。

Abstract: Sobolev training, which integrates target derivatives into the loss
functions, has been shown to accelerate convergence and improve generalization
compared to conventional $L^2$ training. However, the underlying mechanisms of
this training method remain only partially understood. In this work, we present
the first rigorous theoretical framework proving that Sobolev training
accelerates the convergence of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. Under a
student-teacher framework with Gaussian inputs and shallow architectures, we
derive exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians, and quantify the
improvements in conditioning of the loss landscape and gradient-flow
convergence rates. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical
findings and show that the benefits of Sobolev training extend to modern deep
learning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了PPGFlowECG，一个将PPG转换为ECG的两阶段框架，该框架在共享潜在空间中对齐PPG和ECG，并使用潜在的修正流生成高保真ECG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图（ECG）是心脏监测的金标准，但依赖专用设备和训练有素的人员，限制了连续日常监测的可行性。光电容积脉搏波描记法（PPG）提供了可访问的连续监测，但缺乏明确的电生理信息，无法进行明确的诊断。生成模型为将PPG转换为具有临床价值的ECG信号提供了一种有前景的方法，但当前的方法面临着巨大的挑战，包括生成模型中生理语义的错位以及高维信号建模的复杂性。

Method: 提出了PPGFlowECG，一个两阶段框架，该框架通过CardioAlign编码器在共享潜在空间中对齐PPG和ECG，并采用潜在修正流生成具有高保真度和可解释性的ECG。

Result: 在MCMED数据集上的结果表明，该方法对于PPG到ECG的转换和心血管疾病检测是有效的。此外，心脏病专家主导的评估证实，合成的ECG实现了高保真度，并提高了诊断可靠性。

Conclusion: PPGFlowECG在PPG到ECG的转换和心血管疾病检测方面是有效的，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for
cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment
and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring.
Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks
definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis.
Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically
valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges,
including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and
the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose
PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent
space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate
ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade
dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than
118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease
annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG
translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led
evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve
diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world
cardiovascular screening.

*Ziyi Han,Xutong Liu,Ruiting Zhou,Xiangxiang Dai,John C. S. Lui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Tanbr的树状自适应神经bandit路由器，以实现高效可靠的在线MoE推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完整SMoE模型体积庞大以及专家路由的复杂性，将稀疏混合专家（SMoE）应用于在线推理仍然具有挑战性，尤其是在资源受限的边缘网络中。此外，在线推理期间，任务信息通常不可用，导致任务级别路由容易出错。

Method: 本文提出了一种新颖的树状自适应神经bandit路由器Tanbr，它不依赖于显式任务标签，而是从历史数据中估计任务随时间的分布，并使用它来指导给定预训练MoE中的任务感知专家合并。Tanbr采用二叉树来逐步划分空间并生成更精细的候选权重，以处理合并权重的较大连续空间。然后，它应用神经bandit来学习从合并权重到模型性能的非线性映射，并确定最佳专家合并。

Result: Tanbr将推理延迟降低了至少45％，并将内存使用量降低了高达25％，同时与许多最新的方法相比，保持了较高的准确性。

Conclusion: Tanbr实现了次线性遗憾界，尽管在连续决策空间上运行，但与现有方法相比，匹配了遗憾界。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become a preferred architecture for
scaling Transformer capacity without increasing computational cost, as it
activates only a small subset of experts for each input. However, deploying
such an approach for \textit{online inference} remains challenging due to the
large size of a full SMoE model and the complexity of expert routing,
especially in resource-constrained edge networks. Moreover, during the online
inference, task information is often unavailable, making the task-level routing
error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured adaptive neural
bandit router, \texttt{Tanbr}, to enable efficient and reliable online MoE
inference. Instead of relying on explicit task tags, \texttt{Tanbr} estimates
the task distribution over time from historical data and uses it to guide
task-aware expert merging within a given pre-trained MoE. To handle the large
continuous space of merging weights, \texttt{Tanbr} employs a binary tree to
progressively partition the space and generate finer candidate weights. It then
applies a neural bandit to learn the non-linear mapping from merging weight to
model performance and decides optimal expert merging. We prove that
\texttt{Tanbr} achieves a sublinear regret bound of {\small
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$} over {\small $T$} rounds, despite operating
over a continuous decision space, matching regret bounds compared to existing
methods. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{Tanbr} reduces inference
latency by at least {\small $45\%$} and memory usage by up to {\small $25\%$},
while maintaining a high accuracy compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RDAR的策略，通过学习每个agent的相关性来减少自动驾驶系统的计算负担，该策略能够识别可以从预训练行为模型的输入中排除的agent。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注意力机制在捕捉agent交互时计算成本高昂。自动驾驶系统处理复杂场景时，会考虑所有agent，无论其是否重要。

Method: 将掩蔽过程形式化为一个马尔可夫决策过程，其中动作包括指示agent选择的二进制掩码。

Result: RDAR在大型驾驶数据集上进行了评估，结果表明，在处理明显更少的agent的情况下，RDAR在总体进度、安全性和性能方面实现了可比的驾驶性能。

Conclusion: RDAR能够学习精确的数值相关性度量，并在减少计算负担的同时保持驾驶性能。

Abstract: Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other
hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents,
regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on
the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to
reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention
mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally
computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent
relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled
vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a
pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov
Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent
selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate
its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving
comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and
performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of
the art behavior model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于rollout的强化学习方法没有明确考虑LLM对不同难度级别样本的学习能力。奖励方差在一定程度上反映了LLM当前样本的难度。

Method: 提出了一种课程强化学习框架VCRL，该框架基于群体奖励的方差动态控制训练样本的难度。

Result: 在五个数学基准和两个模型上的实验表明，VCRL优于当前的LLM RL基线。

Conclusion: VCRL在数学推理任务中优于当前LLM RL基线。

Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in
improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based
reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly
consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels,
which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning
tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the
rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current
sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower
variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based
on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance
of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models
reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

Motivation: 高维非线性滤波在许多工程和应用科学领域仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。现有的基于分数的扩散模型需要重复训练以跟踪不断变化的先验，这在高维度中是不切实际的。

Method: 提出了一种条件评分滤波器 (CSF)，它利用集变换器编码器和条件扩散模型来实现高效准确的后验采样，而无需重新训练。通过将先验建模和后验采样解耦为离线和在线阶段，CSF 可以在各种非线性系统中实现可扩展的基于分数的滤波。

Result: 在基准问题上的大量实验表明，CSF 在各种非线性滤波场景中实现了卓越的准确性、鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: CSF 是一种很有前途的非线性滤波新方法，它具有优于现有方法的几个优点。

Abstract: In many engineering and applied science domains, high-dimensional nonlinear
filtering is still a challenging problem. Recent advances in score-based
diffusion models offer a promising alternative for posterior sampling but
require repeated retraining to track evolving priors, which is impractical in
high dimensions. In this work, we propose the Conditional Score-based Filter
(CSF), a novel algorithm that leverages a set-transformer encoder and a
conditional diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate posterior
sampling without retraining. By decoupling prior modeling and posterior
sampling into offline and online stages, CSF enables scalable score-based
filtering across diverse nonlinear systems. Extensive experiments on benchmark
problems show that CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency
across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

Conclusion: 这些结果为在非参数回归中使用 KAN 提供了理论基础，并强调了它们作为现有方法的结构化替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a structured and interpretable
framework for multivariate function approximation by composing univariate
transformations through additive or multiplicative aggregation. This paper
establishes theoretical convergence guarantees for KANs when the univariate
components are represented by B-splines. We prove that both additive and hybrid
additive-multiplicative KANs attain the minimax-optimal convergence rate
$O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})$ for functions in Sobolev spaces of smoothness $r$. We
further derive guidelines for selecting the optimal number of knots in the
B-splines. The theory is supported by simulation studies that confirm the
predicted convergence rates. These results provide a theoretical foundation for
using KANs in nonparametric regression and highlight their potential as a
structured alternative to existing methods.

Conclusion: 目前的多目标强化学习方法在气候适应性森林管理方面仍然具有挑战性。

Abstract: Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable
permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation.
However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and
permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot
adequately address. We introduce $\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective
reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest
management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy,
carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms:
site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning
robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of
multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning
difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw
(permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing
minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings,
standard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive
curriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically
selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct
management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive
high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies
balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining
carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest
management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL
as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We
open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate
applications.

Motivation: Transformer 模型在符号回归中很有前景，但其泛化能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 对预训练的 Transformer 符号回归模型进行了系统的实证研究，评估其在预训练分布内外的数据上的泛化能力。

Result: 预训练模型在分布内表现良好，但在分布外场景中性能明显下降。

Conclusion: 泛化差距是实际应用预训练方法的重要障碍。

Abstract: Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for
formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a
promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a
large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is
critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to
problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored.
In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the
generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic
regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training
distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several
state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while
pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently
degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization
gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the
practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in unbalanced
classification tasks, is often hindered by the failure to differentiate between
critical instances near the decision boundary and redundant samples
concentrated in the core of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a
method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of
data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show
that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\%
on 96\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses
datasets up to 90\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more
powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our
method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in
computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training.
By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be
extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering
a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant
computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in
data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force
expansion, driving the next generation of AI advancements. Our code is

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has
offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT
methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the
high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the
generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology
and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian
prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and
expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials
electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the
zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial
charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in
the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output
level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to
the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output
mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with
strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian
prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy
performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing
error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large
condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a
high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC,
comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the
periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results
on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and
efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MCGrad的可扩展多重校准算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多重校准方法在工业界应用有限，因为它们需要手动指定子组，不具备可扩展性，或者会损害模型的其他性能指标。

Method: MCGrad不需要显式指定受保护的组，并且是可扩展的。

Result: MCGrad通常可以改进其他的ML评估指标，已经在Meta的生产环境中部署，并被应用于数百个生产模型。

Conclusion: 在公共数据集和Meta的生产部署中展示了MCGrad的结果。

Abstract: We propose MCGrad, a novel and scalable multicalibration algorithm.
Multicalibration - calibration in sub-groups of the data - is an important
property for the performance of machine learning-based systems. Existing
multicalibration methods have thus far received limited traction in industry.
We argue that this is because existing methods (1) require such subgroups to be
manually specified, which ML practitioners often struggle with, (2) are not
scalable, or (3) may harm other notions of model performance such as log loss
and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PRAUC). MCGrad does not require
explicit specification of protected groups, is scalable, and often improves
other ML evaluation metrics instead of harming them. MCGrad has been in
production at Meta, and is now part of hundreds of production models. We
present results from these deployments as well as results on public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据集的大小和可用性有限，用于重症监护时间序列的领域特定基础模型仍未得到充分开发。

Method: 在基于双轴Transformer (BAT)的pooled电子健康记录数据集上训练模型。

Result: 通过在不同于训练来源的数据集上微调模型来进行死亡率预测，结果表明该模型优于监督基线，尤其是在小型数据集上(<5,000)。

Conclusion: 这些贡献突出了自我监督基础模型在重症监护时间序列中支持资源有限环境中可推广和稳健的临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly in
recent years, yet foundation models for critical care time series remain
relatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets.
In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for
critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on
pooled electronic health record datasets. We demonstrate effective transfer
learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training
sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines,
particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the
potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series
to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited
settings.

TL;DR: PromptCoT 2.0 是一种可扩展的框架，用于生成更难、更多样化的高质量训练问题，以提高大型语言模型 (LLM) 的推理能力。它使用期望最大化 (EM) 循环迭代地改进原理，以指导提示构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量训练问题缺乏，人工数据集成本高且有限，现有合成语料库通常过于简单或狭窄。

Method: 提出 PromptCoT 2.0，一个可扩展的框架，用期望最大化 (EM) 循环替换手工制作的启发式方法，迭代地改进原理以指导提示构建。

Result: 在 self-play 中，将 PromptCoT 2.0 应用于 Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 在 30B 规模上设置了新的最先进的结果。在 SFT 中，仅在合成提示上训练 Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct 可将准确率提高到 73.1 (AIME 24)、65.6 (AIME 25) 和 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5)，超过了在人类或混合数据上训练的模型。

Conclusion: PromptCoT 2.0 是一种可扩展的基础，适用于未来的开源模型，并将提示合成确立为扩展推理的新轴。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into
strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive
programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven
progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems:
human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora
are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales
into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we
present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted
heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are
iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that
are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts
support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve
autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2)
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled
traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new
state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME
24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on
Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts
boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5),
surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm
that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct
problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling
reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future
open-source models. The implementation is available at
https://github.com/inclusionAI/PromptCoT.
