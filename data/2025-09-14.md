### [1] [Noise or Nuance: An Investigation Into Useful Information and Filtering For LLM Driven AKBC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08903)
*Alex Clay,Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz,Pranava Madhyastha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在受限情况下（如 2025 LM-KBC 挑战赛）改进 LLM 输出质量的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在 RAG 和微调等技术受限的情况下，如何提升 LLM 在三元组补全任务中的表现。

Method: 研究了生成、质量保证和 LLM 响应解析三个方面。

Result: 发现在受限环境中，额外信息能提升生成质量，LLM 可有效过滤低质量三元组，LLM 响应解析的灵活性和一致性之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 在受限条件下，额外信息、LLM 过滤和解析策略的选择对三元组补全任务至关重要。

Abstract: RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM
outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC
challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three
facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM
response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional
information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering
poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with
LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

### [2] [Automated Evidence Extraction and Scoring for Corporate Climate Policy Engagement: A Multilingual RAG Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08907)
*Imene Kolli,Ario Saeid Vaghefi,Chiara Colesanti Senni,Shantam Raj,Markus Leippold*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors corporate climate policy engagement. They are trying to automate evidence extraction from documents using AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A significant portion of InfluenceMap's assessment remains manual, making it time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error.

Method: They propose an AI-assisted framework using Retrieval-Augmented Generation, layout-aware parsing, the Nomic embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies.

Result: A combination of the methods yields the best performance in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.

Conclusion: The automated RAG system effectively accelerates evidence extraction, but a human-in-the-loop approach is needed to ensure accuracy.

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of
over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's
support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris
Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although
InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical
workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it
time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an
AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy
engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most
time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data.
Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic
embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates
evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a
human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces,
expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

### [3] [Documents Are People and Words Are Items: A Psychometric Approach to Textual Data with Contextual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08920)
*Jinsong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用大型语言模型分析文本数据的新型心理测量方法，通过将文本数据转化为适合心理测量分析的响应数据，挖掘文本中的潜在知识维度和模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用关键词的语境意义在不同文档中的显著差异来区分文档，从而对文本数据进行心理测量分析。

Method: 该方法包括两个阶段：获取语境分数和进行心理测量分析。首先，利用自然语言处理技术和基于编码器的Transformer模型识别关键词并生成语境分数；然后，采用探索性和双因子模型等多种因子分析方法，提取和定义潜在因子，确定因子相关性，并识别与每个因子相关的最重要词语。

Result: 在Wiki STEM语料库上的实验结果表明，该方法能够有效揭示文本数据中的潜在知识维度和模式。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了文本数据的心理测量分析能力，并在教育、心理学和法律等领域具有应用前景。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual
data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create
contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for
psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items,
this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the
assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly
across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The
modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and
performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural
language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify
common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ
various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to
extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify
the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki
STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to
uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This
approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also
holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as
education, psychology, and law.

### [4] [BRoverbs -- Measuring how much LLMs understand Portuguese proverbs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08960)
*Thales Sales Almeida,Giovana Kerche Bonás,João Guilherme Alves Santos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的葡萄牙语语言模型评估基准，该基准使用巴西谚语来评估模型对区域表达的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有葡萄牙语评估方法依赖于翻译数据集，无法完全捕捉语言细微差别或文化参考。现有的葡萄牙语数据集主要关注结构化的国家考试或社交媒体互动的情感分析，从而在评估更广泛的语言理解方面存在差距。

Method: 本文设计了一个名为 BRoverbs 的数据集，该数据集专门用于通过巴西谚语评估 LLM 性能。

Result: BRoverbs 旨在为葡萄牙语语言 LLM 提供一种新的评估工具，从而有助于推进区域信息基准测试。

Conclusion: BRoverbs 提供了一种评估 LLM 在理解区域表达能力方面的新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations
depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied.
This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can
assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of
Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated
datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references.
Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on
structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions,
leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this
limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess
LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic
resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex
syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional
expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for
Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed
benchmarking. The benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tropic-AI/BRoverbs.

### [5] [Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013)
*Monjoy Narayan Choudhury,Junling Wang,Yifan Hou,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)在处理需要综合感知和符号计算的任务时表现不佳，尤其是在视觉方程求解方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在视觉方程求解任务中的局限性，该任务需要识别图像中的数学方程、物体图标代表的变量以及通过计数推断出的系数。

Method: 将任务分解为系数计数和变量识别，分析VLMs在每个步骤中的表现。

Result: 发现计数是主要瓶颈，即使识别准确。组合识别和推理会引入额外的错误。随着方程复杂度的增加，符号推理本身成为一个限制因素。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前VLMs的关键弱点，并为未来改进视觉基础的数学推理指明了方向。

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

### [6] [Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE): Evaluating an LLM's Willingness to Re-engage in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09043)
*Thomas Manuel Rost,Martina Figlia,Bernd Wallraff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE是一种通过询问大型语言模型是否愿意继续与用户交互来判断其意愿的简单诊断信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估大型语言模型在不同语调下的交互意愿。

Method: 通过3种语调（友好、不明确、辱骂）和10种交互的刺激集，测试了四个开放权重聊天模型在四种框架条件下的表现，共进行了480次试验。

Result: SPICE能清晰区分用户语调。友好交互几乎一致倾向于继续（97.5% YES），辱骂交互强烈倾向于停止（17.9% YES），不明确交互介于两者之间（60.4% YES）。即使模型未能识别出辱骂行为，仍然强烈表示不愿继续交互（81%）。

Conclusion: SPICE是一种稳健、低开销且可复用的工具，用于审计模型意愿，并通过提供模型状态的直接关系信号来补充现有指标。

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued
Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large
Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a
user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone
(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four
open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480
trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.
Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%
YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue
(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This
core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical
tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse
classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still
overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the
time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a
preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under
ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text
rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,
low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,
complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a
model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support
replication.

### [7] [Improving LLM Safety and Helpfulness using SFT and DPO: A Study on OPT-350M](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09055)
*Piyush Pant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究对齐技术（SFT、DPO 和 SFT+DPO）对提高 OPT-350M 语言模型的安全性和有用性的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过有监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO）来提升语言模型的安全性和有用性。

Method: 使用 Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF 数据集训练和评估四个模型：基础 OPT350M 模型、SFT 模型、DPO 模型以及 SFT+DPO 模型。引入三个关键评估指标：无害率（HmR）、有用率（HpR）和综合对齐分数（CAS）。

Result: SFT 优于 DPO，但 SFT+DPO 模型在所有指标上均优于其他模型。研究结果还强调了噪声数据、有限的 GPU 资源和训练约束带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 微调策略会影响模型对齐，并为未来更强大的对齐管道奠定基础。

Abstract: This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a
combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the
OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset,
we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,
and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation
metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined
Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show
that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all
others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these
techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited
GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view
of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation
for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

### [8] [MR-UIE: Multi-Perspective Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning for Universal Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09082)
*Zhongqiu Li,Shiquan Wang,Ruiyu Fang,Mengjiao Bao,Zhenhe Wu,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li,Zhongjiang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的通用信息抽取（UIE）方法，通过结合强化学习（RL）和多角度推理来提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理复杂schema和多步骤推理场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLMs在通用信息抽取（UIE）任务中，特别是在处理结构化输出和复杂schema时，表现不足。现有的方法通过上下文学习和指令调整来增强LLMs的性能，但仍然存在局限性。

Method: 该论文提出了一种结合强化学习（RL）和多角度推理（MR）的方法，称为MR-UIE。该方法使LLMs从被动抽取器转变为主动推理器。

Result: 在多个信息抽取（IE）基准测试上的实验表明，MR-UIE在各个领域都持续提高了抽取准确率，并在多个数据集上超过了最先进的方法。将多角度推理纳入RL显著提高了复杂IE任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多角度推理在具有挑战性的场景中起着关键作用，MR-UIE 提升了复杂IE任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse
research domains. However, their performance in universal information
extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured
output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require
multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs
through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations
nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for
information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive
extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to
extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks
demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across
domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances
generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning
in challenging scenarios.

### [9] [TigerCoder: A Novel Suite of LLMs for Code Generation in Bangla](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09101)
*Nishat Raihan,Antonios Anastasopoulos,Marcos Zampieri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个专门为孟加拉语设计的代码大型语言模型系列（1B和9B）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语是第五大语言，但在大型语言模型中代表性不足，尤其是在代码生成方面，这主要是由于缺乏高质量的预训练或微调数据。

Method: 本文构建了孟加拉语代码指令数据集，并提出了MBPP-Bangla评估基准，用于评估孟加拉语代码生成。

Result: TigerCoder系列代码大型语言模型在Pass@1上的性能比现有的多语言和通用孟加拉语大型语言模型提高了约11-18%。

Conclusion: 高质量的数据集可以克服小型模型在低资源语言方面的局限性。

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented
in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This
primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or
finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code
LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a
comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain
adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code
generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant
~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and
general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality
datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages.
We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

### [10] [Compass-v3: Scaling Domain-Specific LLMs for Multilingual E-Commerce in Southeast Asia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09121)
*Sophia Maria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compass-v3 is a 245B parameter Mixture-of-Experts model for Southeast Asian e-commerce, outperforming other models and widely used in Shopee.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models' performance declines in specialized tasks like e-commerce due to noisy, heterogeneous, multilingual, and dynamic data.

Method: The model uses fewer but larger experts, hardware-efficient optimizations, mixed-training strategy on 12T tokens, and Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO).

Result: Compass-v3 surpasses DeepSeek-V3.1, GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B in e-commerce, with strong multilingual capabilities.

Conclusion: Compass-v3 demonstrates strengths in commerce expertise and linguistic competence, widely used in Shopee, replacing over 70% of OpenAI's traffic.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their
performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific
knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy,
heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a
vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and
71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3
adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient
optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy
operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of
curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions
using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose
Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures
token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in
commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3
delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1,
GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong
multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages
(Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while
sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been
widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is
gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM
usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and
broad linguistic competence.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用生成式人工智能自动分类导师对话行为（DA）的方法，以减少传统手动编码所需的时间和精力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在减少传统手动编码对话行为所需的时间和精力。

Method: 使用定制的提示测试 GPT-3.5-turbo 和 GPT-4 模型，并使用了开源 CIMA 语料库。

Result: GPT-4 达到了 80% 的准确率，加权 F1 分数为 0.81，Cohen's Kappa 为 0.74，超过了基线性能，表明与人工注释基本一致。

Conclusion: 生成式人工智能在 DA 分类方面具有强大的潜力，可以为教育对话分析提供高效且易于访问的方法。

Abstract: This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the
classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and
effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the
open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four
DA categories. Both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models were tested using tailored
prompts. Results show that GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, a weighted F1-score of
0.81, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, surpassing baseline performance and
indicating substantial agreement with human annotations. These findings suggest
that generative AI has strong potential to provide an efficient and accessible
approach to DA classification, with meaningful implications for educational
dialogue analysis. The study also highlights the importance of task-specific
label definitions and contextual information in enhancing the quality of
automated annotation. Finally, it underscores the ethical considerations
associated with the use of generative AI and the need for responsible and
transparent research practices. The script of this research is publicly

*Phuong-Nam Dang,Kieu-Linh Nguyen,Thanh-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ViRanker is a cross-encoder reranking model for Vietnamese, built on BGE-M3 and Blockwise Parallel Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of competitive rerankers for Vietnamese, a low-resource language.

Method: Trained on a curated 8 GB corpus and fine-tuned with hybrid hard-negative sampling.

Result: Achieves strong early-rank accuracy on MMARCO-VI, surpassing multilingual baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates how architectural adaptation and data curation can advance reranking in underrepresented languages and is released on Hugging Face to encourage adoption.

Abstract: This paper presents ViRanker, a cross-encoder reranking model tailored to the
Vietnamese language. Built on the BGE-M3 encoder and enhanced with the
Blockwise Parallel Transformer, ViRanker addresses the lack of competitive
rerankers for Vietnamese, a low-resource language with complex syntax and
diacritics. The model was trained on an 8 GB curated corpus and fine-tuned with
hybrid hard-negative sampling to strengthen robustness. Evaluated on the
MMARCO-VI benchmark, ViRanker achieves strong early-rank accuracy, surpassing
multilingual baselines and competing closely with PhoRanker. By releasing the
model openly on Hugging Face, we aim to support reproducibility and encourage
wider adoption in real-world retrieval systems. Beyond Vietnamese, this study
illustrates how careful architectural adaptation and data curation can advance
reranking in other underrepresented languages.

### [13] [LITcoder: A General-Purpose Library for Building and Comparing Encoding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09152)
*Taha Binhuraib,Ruimin Gao,Anna A. Ivanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LITcoder is an open-source library that simplifies building and benchmarking neural encoding models for brain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli with brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those features onto brain data, and evaluating model performance.

Method: Implements a modular pipeline with various design choices, including brain datasets, stimulus features, and downsampling approaches. It also offers built-in logging, plotting, and integration with experiment tracking platforms.

Result: Demonstrates scalability and versatility by fitting encoding models to three story listening datasets and exploring critical methodological choices for continuous fMRI data.

Conclusion: LITcoder lowers technical barriers, facilitates comparisons, fosters rigor, and accelerates the development of high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking
neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides
standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with
brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those
features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the
resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline
covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can
easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core
infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus
feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling
approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in
logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms
such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility
of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening
datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore
the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous
fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR
scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),
incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize
information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model
predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model
implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,
fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality
high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

### [14] [Target-oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification with Counterfactual-enhanced Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09160)
*Zhiyue Liu,Fanrong Ma,Xin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的反事实增强去偏框架，以减少目标导向的多模态情感分类中由文本内容过度依赖和数据集偏差引起的虚假相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖文本内容，忽略了数据集偏差，导致文本特征和输出标签之间产生虚假相关性，从而降低了分类准确性。

Method: 该框架包含一个反事实数据增强策略，该策略可以最小程度地改变情感相关的因果特征，生成细节匹配的图像-文本样本，以引导模型关注与情感相关的内容。此外，为了从反事实数据中学习鲁棒的特征并提示模型决策，我们引入了一种自适应的去偏对比学习机制，该机制可以有效地减轻有偏词的影响。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的方法来解决目标导向的多模态情感分类中的虚假相关性问题，并在实验中取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict
sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Yuhao Zhang,Yuhao Du,Zhanchen Dai,Xiangnan Ma,Kaiqi Kou,Benyou Wang,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLLMs degrade in knowledge/reasoning compared to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLLM training fails to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap.

Method: Propose EchoX: uses semantic representations and dynamically generates speech training targets to integrate acoustic and semantic learning.

Result: EchoX achieves advanced performance on knowledge-based QA benchmarks with 6k hours of training data.

Conclusion: EchoX preserves strong reasoning abilities as a speech LLM by bridging the acoustic-semantic gap.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing
attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often
exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize
that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail
to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To
address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations
and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates
both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong
reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced
performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks. The
project is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/EchoX.

Motivation: Trie-based biasing在识别稀有词时存在计算量大的问题，尤其是在大型解码器模型中。

Method: 通过调整ASR模型，使其能够向前看并一次预测多个步骤，从而避免revocation步骤。

Result: 通过使用10小时的合成数据微调Whisper模型，该方法将NSC Part 2测试集上的词错误率从30.86%降低到12.19%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地提高了ASR模型识别稀有词的准确率，并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by
prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is
Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g.
"Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the
full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those
earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is
computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To
overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and
predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by
better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of
the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic
data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from
30.86% to 12.19%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的基于TCPGen的上下文偏置方法，用于提高语音识别模型对稀有词的识别能力。该方法通过引入关键词感知损失函数，在训练偏置模块时更加关注偏置词，从而在推理过程中更好地解码偏置词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文偏置方法在训练偏置模块时，使用合成的稀有词数据容易过拟合。为了解决这个问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种增强的TCPGen上下文偏置方法，并提出了一种关键词感知的损失函数，该损失函数包括一个用于偏置词预测的掩蔽交叉熵项和一个用于检测偏置词位置的二元分类项。

Result: 通过将Whisper模型适应于10小时的合成数据，该方法在NSC Part 2测试集上的词错误率从29.71%降低到11.81%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够有效地提高语音识别模型对稀有词的识别能力。

Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic
data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through
contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model
architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic
rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to
overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we
enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a
keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when
training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for
biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased
word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased
words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our
method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to
11.81%.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了 Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM)，一个专门为 Marmoset 猴子声音交流优化的语音语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究 Marmoset 猴子的声音交流，可以将其与大脑活动联系起来，为语音和语言研究提供独特的机会。现有的 LLM 方法不能直接应用于 Marmoset 猴子的声音交流。

Method: 设计了一个新的零样本评估指标，使用无监督的野生数据和弱标记的对话数据来评估 GmSLM，并将其与基于人类语音的基线进行比较。

Result: GmSLM 生成的声音在声学上与真实的重合成样本非常匹配，并在下游任务中表现良好。即使在完全无监督的情况下，GmSLM 也能有效地将真实对话与人工对话区分开来。

Conclusion: GmSLM 可以支持对声音交流神经基础的进一步研究，并提供了一个连接声音和大脑活动的实用框架。GmSLM 将有利于神经科学、生物声学和进化生物学未来的研究。

Abstract: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view
that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar
features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking.
Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with
brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in
speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through
vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We
introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized
spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a
novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data,
alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate
its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated
vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and
performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM
effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support
further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides
a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM
stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary
biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CCF的上下文压缩框架，旨在通过学习分层潜在表示来减少输入冗余，从而实现高效的长上下文建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展语言模型的上下文对于捕获扩展语篇中的丰富依赖关系至关重要。然而，简单的上下文扩展会带来巨大的计算和内存负担，导致训练和推理效率低下。

Method: CCF集成了分段语义聚合与键-值记忆编码，形成紧凑的表示，支持精确的重建和远程理解。此外，还引入了一种训练高效的优化策略，将增量段解码与稀疏储层采样相结合，从而显著降低了内存开销。

Result: 在多个长上下文语言建模基准测试中的经验结果表明，CCF在高压缩率下实现了有竞争力的困惑度，并且与现有方法相比，显著提高了吞吐量和内存效率。

Conclusion: 结构化压缩在可扩展和有效的长上下文语言建模方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich
dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension
imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in
inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose
CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient
long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that
preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF
integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding,
forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and
long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a
training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment
decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead
without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context
language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive
perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput
and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight
the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context
language modeling.

Abstract: Accurately assessing candidate seniority from resumes is a critical yet
challenging task, complicated by the prevalence of overstated experience and
ambiguous self-presentation. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of
large language models (LLMs), including fine-tuned BERT architectures, for
automating seniority classification in resumes. To rigorously evaluate model
performance, we introduce a hybrid dataset comprising both real-world resumes
and synthetically generated hard examples designed to simulate exaggerated
qualifications and understated seniority. Using the dataset, we evaluate the
performance of Large Language Models in detecting subtle linguistic cues
associated with seniority inflation and implicit expertise. Our findings
highlight promising directions for enhancing AI-driven candidate evaluation
systems and mitigating bias introduced by self-promotional language. The

Abstract: Question Answering over Tabular Data (Table QA) presents unique challenges
due to the diverse structure, size, and data types of real-world tables. The
SemEval 2025 Task 8 (DataBench) introduced a benchmark composed of large-scale,

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于弱监督和语义对齐的专利 SDG 分类方法，利用大型语言模型从专利和 SDG 论文中提取结构化概念，构建复合标签函数，生成银标准数据集，用于训练多标签回归模型。该方法在内部和外部验证中均表现出色，证明了其在规模化 SDG 分类中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专利 SDG 分类方法缺乏可扩展性和通用性，且缺乏大型标注数据集。

Method: 1. 将专利 SDG 分类视为弱监督问题；2. 利用来自专利的引文作为噪声初始信号；3. 开发复合标签函数，使用大型语言模型提取结构化概念；4. 使用基于排序的检索方法计算和组合跨域相似度得分；5. 通过自定义的正向损失校准标签函数；6. 生成银标准数据集，用于训练多标签回归模型。

Result: 该方法优于包括基于 Transformer 的模型和零样本 LLM 在内的多个基线模型，并且在专利引文、共同发明人和共同申请人图谱中揭示了比传统技术分类更大的主题、认知和组织一致性。

Conclusion: 弱监督和语义对齐可以增强大规模 SDG 分类。

Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot
LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,
co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

*Channdeth Sok,David Luz,Yacine Haddam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaRAG: A metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods don't address the challenges of RAG systems, where responses should align with retrieved evidence.

Method: Decompose answers, mutate factoids, verify against retrieved context, and aggregate inconsistency penalties.

Result: MetaRAG effectively detects hallucinations in a proprietary enterprise dataset.

Conclusion: MetaRAG enables trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents and allows for identity-aware safeguards.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,
confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,
such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not
address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore
present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,
unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor
access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes
domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into
atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using
synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the
retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms
contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a
response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG
localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,
pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),
allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure
thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a
proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for
detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based
conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that
translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this
design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

Motivation: 动机是 связать когнитивные теории об аналоговых рассуждениях с современными исследованиями в области обработки естественного языка и показать, как эти понятия связаны с основными задачами в исследованиях обработки естественного языка.

Method: 方法是 обобщение ключевых теорий об аналоговых рассуждениях и связывание их с концепциями в NLP.

Result: 结果是 展示了 связь между процессами аналогового мышления и концепциями в NLP, а также их значимость для решения задач в NLP.

Conclusion: 结论是 研究人员 могут лучше оптимизировать реляционное понимание текста, а не полагаться в основном на сходство на уровне сущностей.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is an essential aspect of human cognition. In this
paper, we summarize key theory about the processes underlying analogical
reasoning from the cognitive science literature and relate it to current
research in natural language processing. While these processes can be easily
linked to concepts in NLP, they are generally not viewed through a cognitive
lens. Furthermore, we show how these notions are relevant for several major
challenges in NLP research, not directly related to analogy solving. This may
guide researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text, as
opposed to relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

Motivation: 现有的图线性化方法标签空间大，结构信息保存可能不完整。

Method: 该方法将图编码为序列，使用 n 个 tagging actions 实现线性时间解析，同时保留了重入、循环和空节点。

Result: 在多语言和多形式基准测试中，该方法取得了有竞争力的结果，并且在精确匹配准确率上相对于其他方法有持续的改进。

Conclusion: 该分层括号编码方法在依赖图解析中具有优势，可以在减小标签空间的同时保持结构信息，并在精确匹配准确率上优于其他方法。

Abstract: We revisit hierarchical bracketing encodings from a practical perspective in
the context of dependency graph parsing. The approach encodes graphs as
sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with $n$ tagging actions, and still
representing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. Compared to existing graph
linearizations, this representation substantially reduces the label space while
preserving structural information. We evaluate it on a multilingual and
multi-formalism benchmark, showing competitive results and consistent
improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

Motivation: 现有方法计算开销大或校准效果差，使其在实际应用中不实用且不可靠。本文旨在解决这些问题，实现 LLM 置信度获取的可扩展性和可靠性。

Method: GrACE 采用了一种新颖的机制，模型通过最后一个隐藏状态与词汇表中附加的特殊 token 嵌入之间的相似性来表达置信度，并对模型进行微调，以使用与准确性相关的校准目标来校准置信度。

Result: 在三个 LLM 和两个基准数据集上的实验表明，GrACE 产生的置信度在开放式生成任务上实现了最佳的区分能力和校准效果，优于六种竞争方法，且无需额外的采样或辅助模型。GrACE 不仅提高了最终决策的准确性，还显著减少了测试时缩放方案中所需的样本数量。

Conclusion: GrACE 是一种可扩展、可靠且实时的置信度估计的 LLM 部署实用解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence
elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications,
such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive
computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical
and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a
Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and
reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in
which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden
state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in
real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with
calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and
two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the
best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,
outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or
an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time
scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that
using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also
significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling
scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying
LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

Motivation: 在简历推荐系统中，职位匹配是一个关键挑战，但重叠术语通常有限或具有误导性。之前的研究在总体性能上评估模型，忽略了对语义相关性不同区域的细粒度分析。

Method: 提出了一种自监督混合架构，结合了密集句子嵌入和领域知识图谱(KG)，并通过图神经网络进行KG整合。将STR分数连续体划分为低、中、高语义相关性的不同区域，进行分层评估。

Result: 结果表明，经过微调的SBERT模型与KG结合，在高STR区域产生了持续的改进，RMSE比强基线降低了25%。

Conclusion: 结合KG与文本嵌入具有优势，区域性能分析对于理解模型行为至关重要。这种细粒度方法揭示了全局指标隐藏的优势和劣势，并支持在人力资源(HR)系统中进行更有针对性的模型选择。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.

Abstract: This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition

language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label
distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we
evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we
show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations
(perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft
labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are
promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the
perspectivist community.

Motivation: 在线课程环境给社交群体的自然形成带来了障碍。为了探索这一点，我们提出了一种人格检测模型，该模型利用 GPT 的零样本能力来推断五大人格特质

Method: 利用 GPT 的零样本能力从论坛介绍帖子中推断出五大人格特质，并将其集成到 SAMI 的基于实体的匹配系统中，从而实现基于人格信息的社交推荐。

Result: 我们将其性能与已建立的模型进行基准测试，证明了其在这项任务中的有效性。初始集成表明，人格特质可以补充现有的匹配因素

Conclusion: 人格特质可以补充现有的匹配因素，尽管需要进行额外的评估以确定其对学生参与度和匹配质量的全部影响。

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments
present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one
solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is
constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an
effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to
intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs
zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum
introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its
performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this
task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking
system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial
integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching
factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full
impact on student engagement and match quality.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个新的基准数据集EXPRESS，用于评估大型语言模型(llm)在细粒度情感对齐方面的能力，发现llm在准确预测与人类自述情感对齐的情感方面仍然面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中于将情感分类为预定义的有限类别，忽略了更细微的表达。为了解决这一差距，我们引入了EXPRESS。

Method: 我们引入EXPRESS，一个来自Reddit社区的基准数据集，包含251个细粒度的、自我披露的情感标签。我们的综合评估框架检查预测的情感术语，并使用已建立的情感理论将它们分解为八种基本情感，从而实现细粒度的比较。

Result: 对流行的llm在各种提示设置下进行的系统测试表明，准确预测与人类自我披露的情感相一致的情感仍然具有挑战性。定性分析进一步表明，虽然某些llm生成的情感术语与已建立的情感理论和定义相一致，但它们有时无法像人类自我披露那样有效地捕捉语境线索。

Conclusion: 这些发现突出了llm在细粒度情感对齐方面的局限性，并为未来旨在增强其语境理解的研究提供了见解。

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language
understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research.
While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a
critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a
fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions
into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To
address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit
communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our
comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and
decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,
enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under
various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align
with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis
further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with
established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture
contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings
highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer
insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LA-VA的新方法，该方法结合了大型语言模型（LLM）与传统算法方法和基于嵌入的分类，以改进死因预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源有限的环境中，语言尸检（VA）是估计死亡原因的关键工具，但缺乏医疗认证。本文旨在提高死因预测的准确性。

Method: 使用人口健康指标研究联盟（PHMRC）数据集，结合GPT-5预测、LCVA基线、文本嵌入和元学习器集成等多种方法。

Result: GPT-5实现了最高的个体性能，平均测试站点准确率分别为48.6%（成人）、50.5%（儿童）和53.5%（新生儿），比传统的统计机器学习基线高出5-10%。

Conclusion: 简单的现成LLM辅助方法可以显著提高语言尸检的准确性，对低资源环境中的全球健康监测具有重要意义。

Abstract: Verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating causes of death in
resource-limited settings where medical certification is unavailable. This
study presents LA-VA, a proof-of-concept pipeline that combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) with traditional algorithmic approaches and embedding-based
classification for improved cause-of-death prediction. Using the Population
Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) dataset across three age categories
(Adult: 7,580; Child: 1,960; Neonate: 2,438), we evaluate multiple approaches:
GPT-5 predictions, LCVA baseline, text embeddings, and meta-learner ensembles.
Our results demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves the highest individual performance
with average test site accuracies of 48.6% (Adult), 50.5% (Child), and 53.5%
(Neonate), outperforming traditional statistical machine learning baselines by
5-10%. Our findings suggest that simple off-the-shelf LLM-assisted approaches
could substantially improve verbal autopsy accuracy, with important
implications for global health surveillance in low-resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MOAT的多智能体联合对齐调整框架，通过迭代对齐来改善智能体之间的协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立微调智能体，导致智能体之间存在能力差距，协调性差。为了解决这个问题。

Method: MOAT在两个关键阶段之间交替进行：（1）规划智能体对齐，优化规划智能体以生成更好地指导基础智能体的子目标序列；（2）基础智能体改进，使用智能体自身生成的多样化子目标-动作对来微调基础智能体，以增强其泛化能力。

Result: 在六个基准测试中进行的实验表明，MOAT优于最先进的基线，在held-in任务上的平均改进为3.1%，在held-out任务上的平均改进为4.4%。

Conclusion: MOAT确保了一个非递减和逐渐收敛的训练过程，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction
of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities
among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a
grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically
fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them
with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint
Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative
alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent
Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences
that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which
fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by
the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis
proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training
process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in
tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

*Siddarth Mamidanna,Daking Rai,Ziyu Yao,Yilun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在心算任务中的内部运作方式，发现了一个“All-for-One”（AF1）子图，该子图在模型性能中起着关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在计算任务中表现出色，但其内部运作机制仍不清楚。本文旨在探究模型如何在心算任务中利用tokens进行计算和信息传递。

Method: 该论文通过三种步骤来研究这个问题：抑制初始层中特定于输入的token计算，限制中间层中token位置之间的信息传递路径，并强制所有计算在剩余层中的最后一个token上进行。提出了Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA)和Attention-Based Peeking (ABP)两种技术。

Result: 研究发现了一个“All-for-One”（AF1）子图，该子图在各种心算任务中都具有很高的准确性，有意义的计算发生在很晚的层，并且只在最后一个token上进行，该token接收来自中间层其他token的信息。实验表明，该子图对于模型的高性能是充分且必要的，可以在不同的模型之间转移，并且适用于各种输入样式。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，大型语言模型中的心算任务主要依赖于一个特定的子图结构，该结构在模型的深层进行计算，并且只在最后一个token上进行。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous
computational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the
combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows
every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In
practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental
math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without
explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting
input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes
of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and
forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.
With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and
Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with
high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful
computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last
token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle
layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that
this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers
across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on
different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other
methods, which may be of independent interest.

TL;DR: SteerMoE: 通过控制行为相关的专家来引导 MoE 模型，无需重新训练或修改权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 中的 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) 模型将每个 token 通过专门的前馈网络 (FFN) 的子集进行路由，这些子集被称为专家。本文旨在通过检测和控制行为相关的专家来引导 MoE 模型。

Method: 通过检测具有不同激活模式的专家来识别行为相关的专家，并在推理过程中选择性地（停）激活这些专家。

Result: 在 11 个基准测试和 6 个 LLM 上，引导将安全性提高了 +20%，保真度提高了 +27%。在对抗性攻击模式下，单独使用时安全性降低了 -41%，与现有的越狱方法结合使用时降低了 -100%。

Conclusion: SteerMoE 揭示了隐藏在专家内部的对齐伪造的新维度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token
through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts.
We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and
controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts
with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting
behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we
control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying
weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to
+20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by
-41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing
all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden
within experts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于好奇心驱动探索(CDE)的强化学习框架，以提高大型语言模型(LLM)的推理能力，解决RLVR方法中探索不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法探索不足，导致过早收敛和熵坍塌。

Method: 利用模型自身的内在好奇心来指导探索，使用actor的困惑度和critic的多头架构的方差作为探索奖励。

Result: 在AIME基准测试中，本文方法比使用GRPO/PPO的标准RLVR提高了约3个点。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的探索方法，可以有效提高LLM的推理能力，并发现了RLVR中的校准崩溃机制。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet
current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and
entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven
Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense
of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from
both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its
generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates
from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus
within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and
promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the
critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.
Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over
standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a
calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM
failure modes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ReT-2的统一检索模型，支持多模态查询和检索多模态文档集合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要依赖于特定任务的视觉-语言模型的微调，并且仅限于单模态查询或文档。

Method: 利用多层表示和一个具有LSTM启发式门控机制的循环Transformer架构，以动态地整合跨层和模态的信息，捕捉细粒度的视觉和文本细节。

Result: 在M2KR和M-BEIR基准测试中，ReT-2在不同的检索配置中始终如一地实现了最先进的性能，同时与先前的方法相比，提供了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用率。

Conclusion: ReT-2在各种设置中都达到了最先进的性能，并且在集成到检索增强生成管道中时，还可以提高百科全书式的VQA和InfoSeek数据集的下游性能。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的动作识别方法，该方法使用视觉扩散模型（VDM）生成的特征，并通过transformer进行聚合，以实现类人动作识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型在跨物种、视角和上下文等泛化方面存在困难。

Method: 使用由扩散过程的早期时间步长调节的模型来突出提取特征中的语义信息，而不是像素级细节。

Result: 该模型在所有三个泛化基准测试中都取得了新的state-of-the-art成果。

Conclusion: 该模型使机器动作识别更接近于类人的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个新的模块化prompt框架，它可以防止有害信息的生成。它使用了一种名为VulnGuard Prompt的混合技术，该技术使用真实世界的数据驱动的对比学习来防止有害信息的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在实际应用中的激增带来了前所未有的风险，即会向包括 LGBTQ+ 个人、单亲父母和边缘化社区在内的弱势群体生成有害、有偏见或误导性信息。现有的安全方法依赖于事后过滤或通用对齐技术，但它们无法在生成源头主动防止有害输出。

Method: PromptGuard 采用了一种混合技术，称为 VulnGuard Prompt，它使用真实世界的数据驱动的对比学习来防止有害信息的生成。VulnGuard 集成了来自精选的 GitHub 存储库的少量示例、伦理链式思维推理和自适应角色提示，以创建特定于人口的保护屏障。该框架采用了具有正式证明的理论多目标优化，通过熵界和帕累托最优性证明了 25-30% 的分析危害降低。

Result: 通过熵界和帕累托最优性证明了 25-30% 的分析危害降低。

Conclusion: PromptGuard 协调六个核心模块：输入分类、VulnGuard Prompting、伦理原则集成、外部工具交互、输出验证和用户-系统交互，从而创建一个用于实时危害预防的智能专家系统。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的异常值检测框架 Beta-SOD，用于解决 Re-ID 中标签噪声的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Re-ID 方法对标签噪声非常敏感，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 将 Re-ID 重新定义为监督图像相似性任务，并采用 Siamese 网络架构，训练以捕获判别性成对关系。使用 Beta 混合模型对嵌入对之间的余弦相似度分布进行建模，并提出了新颖的 Beta-SOD 框架。

Result: 在 CUHK03、Market-1501 和 VeRi-776 数据集上，该方法在人员和车辆 Re-ID 任务中表现出优于现有方法的性能，并且在各种噪声水平下都表现出鲁棒性和广泛的适用性。

Conclusion: Beta-SOD 是一种有效去噪方法，可以提高 Re-ID 在噪声环境下的性能。

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SFD-Mamba2Net的端到端框架，用于ICA血管分割和狭窄检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割和检测方法难以应用于低对比度、高噪声和复杂血管结构的ICA图像。

Method: 在编码器中嵌入曲率感知结构增强（CASE）模块，利用多尺度响应突出血管结构；在解码器中引入逐级高频感知（PHFP）模块，通过多级小波分解细化高频细节。

Result: SFD-Mamba2Net在八个分割指标上均优于现有方法，并在狭窄检测中实现了最高的真正率和阳性预测值。

Conclusion: SFD-Mamba2Net在ICA图像的血管分割和狭窄检测方面表现出色。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Method: 该框架包括一个分割流程和一个放射组学流程。分割流程利用promptable foundation模型完成缺失标签，并提出了SAMONAI算法来提高分割准确性和效率。放射组学流程从每个肿瘤中提取特征，并使用SurvAMINN（一种基于自动编码器的多实例神经网络）预测生存率。

Result: 在包含227名患者的数据集上进行的评估表明，该框架的C指数提高了10%以上，优于现有的临床和基因组生物标志物。

Conclusion: 结果表明，集成自动分割算法和基于放射组学的生存分析具有在CRLM中提供准确、注释高效和可解释的结果预测的潜力。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

Conclusion: 使用CompCon比较了流行的文本到图像模型，发现了不同的表示，例如PixArt如何用湿街道描绘提到孤独的prompt，以及Stable Diffusion 3.5如何在媒体行业中描绘非裔美国人。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的机器学习方法，用于识别和提取无人机影像中的云影和太阳耀斑区域，并将其与无遮挡的晴空区域和不受太阳耀斑影响的区域分开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机系统（UAS）的使用在本十年内大幅增加。它们显著促进了遥感技术的发展，能够根据各种遥感应用所需的空间、光谱、时间和辐射分辨率来部署和成像地形。无人机影像的主要优点之一是可以在多云条件下通过在云层下飞行无人机来获取影像。这项技术的局限性在于影像经常受到云影的污染。在水面上拍摄的图像还会受到太阳耀斑的影响。这是从无人机图像估计水质参数的两个严重问题。

Method: 该研究提出了一种新的机器学习方法，首先识别和提取具有云影和太阳耀斑的区域，并将这些区域与无遮挡的晴空区域和不受太阳耀斑影响的区域分开。从像素级的图像中提取数据，以训练一个基于U-Net的深度学习模型，并根据测试案例中的各种评估指标确定模型训练的最佳设置。

Result: 使用这种评估，确定了一个高质量的图像校正模型，该模型用于恢复图像中的云影和太阳耀斑区域。

Conclusion: 确定了一个高质量的图像校正模型，该模型用于恢复图像中的云影和太阳耀斑区域。

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoSwin的新型特征融合架构，通过结合局部卷积特征学习来增强分层移位窗口注意力，从而改进 Vision Transformers (ViT) 在小数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT 依赖自注意力来建模长距离依赖关系，但它们对全局上下文的强调通常以牺牲小数据集中的局部特征提取为代价，尤其是在缺乏关键的归纳偏置（如局部性和平移等方差）的情况下。

Method: CoSwin 将可学习的局部特征增强模块集成到每个注意力块中，使模型能够同时捕获细粒度的空间细节和全局语义结构。

Result: 在多个图像分类基准测试中，CoSwin 的实验结果表明，与最先进的卷积模型和基于 Transformer 的模型相比，性能得到了持续提升。在 CIFAR-10 上提高了 2.17%，在 CIFAR-100 上提高了 4.92%，在 MNIST 上提高了 0.10%，在 SVHN 上提高了 0.26%，在 Tiny ImageNet 上提高了 4.47%。

Conclusion: 这些改进强调了局部-全局特征融合在增强小型视觉 Transformer 的泛化性和鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher: A differentiable framework for feature matching in point cloud registration, improving rigid registration performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature matching in point cloud registration by incorporating local and global consistency.

Method: Learned features predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, refined through local graph embedding, repositioning via nearest neighbor search, and global geometric consistency learning.

Result: Significantly improves rigid registration performance, achieving state-of-the-art inlier ratios on KITTI, KITTI-360, and 3DMatch datasets.

Conclusion: iMatcher demonstrates robustness across diverse settings and significantly improves rigid registration performance.

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于 SDF 的方法依赖于精确的注释，忽略了 B 超图像中丰富的声学信息，并且难以处理超声的视角依赖性和声影伪影，这会损害重建效果。

Method: 提出了一种基于 occupancy 的表示方法 UltrON，它利用声学特征来改善几何一致性，并提出了一个新的损失函数，以补偿 B 超图像中的视角依赖性，并促进多视角超声的 occupancy 优化。

Result: 通过结合声学特性，UltrON 可以推广到相同解剖结构的形状，并减轻遮挡和稀疏标记的限制，从而实现更精确的 3D 重建。

Conclusion: UltrON 缓解了遮挡和稀疏标记的限制，为更精确的 3D 重建铺平了道路。

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的方法，用于预测连续的左心室（LV）位移，无需推理时优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从标记MRI自动量化心肌运动和应变仍然是一项重要但具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 使用以学习的潜在代码为条件的隐式神经表示（INR）来预测连续的左心室（LV）位移。

Result: 在452个英国生物银行测试案例中评估，该方法实现了最佳的跟踪精度（2.14 mm RMSE），并且与三个深度学习基线相比，在全球周向（2.86％）和径向（6.42％）应变中实现了最低的综合误差。此外，该方法比最准确的基线快约380倍。

Conclusion: 这些结果突出了基于INR的模型的适用性，可用于大型CMR数据集中心肌应变的准确且可扩展的分析。

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强的互学习网络（E-MLNet），通过动态加权策略改进了开放集熵最小化（OEM），从而更有效地进行通用领域自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用领域自适应方法平等对待所有分类器，稀释了学习信号。

Method: E-MLNet集成了动态加权策略到OEM中，利用闭集分类器的预测，将自适应集中在每个目标样本最相关的类别边界上。

Result: 在Office-31、Office-Home、VisDA-2017和ImageCLEF四个基准数据集上进行了大量实验，E-MLNet在VisDA和ImageCLEF上取得了最高的平均H-scores，并且比之前的模型表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: E-MLNet在大多数单独的自适应任务中优于强大的MLNet基线，证实了作者提出的聚焦自适应策略的优势。

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

TL;DR: 提出了一个大型的乌尔都语图像字幕数据集COCO-Urdu，以解决该语言在多模态和视觉语言研究中资源不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言视觉语言模型主要在高资源语言上训练，对乌尔都语的支持不足，缺乏大型高质量的乌尔都语数据集是主要瓶颈。

Method: 从MS COCO数据集中选取59,000张图像，并使用SeamlessM4T v2翻译生成319,000条乌尔都语字幕，通过混合多模态质量评估框架（COMET-Kiwi、CLIP、BERTScore）进行验证和迭代优化。

Result: COCO-Urdu是目前最大的公开乌尔都语字幕数据集，并在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF等指标上取得了较好的结果。

Conclusion: 发布COCO-Urdu数据集和质量评估流程旨在减少多模态研究中的语言偏差，并为构建包容性的视觉语言系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Motivation: 现有基于fMRI的视觉解码方法依赖于特定主体的训练，限制了可扩展性和实际部署。

Method: VoxelFormer集成了用于有效voxel压缩的Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) 和一个query-driven Q-Former，它可以生成与CLIP图像嵌入空间对齐的固定大小的神经表示。

Result: 在7T Natural Scenes Dataset上进行评估，VoxelFormer在训练期间包含的受试者上实现了具有竞争力的检索性能，并且参数明显少于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes

included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为概率因果图模型 (PCGM) 的新方法，用于生成高质量的结构性脑部 MRI 图像，该方法集成了体素级别的解剖约束作为先验，以解决现有反事实模型难以生成解剖学上合理的 MRI 的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实模型由于缺乏明确的归纳偏置来保留细粒度的解剖细节，因此难以生成解剖学上合理的 MRI，这阻碍了 MRI 研究中对图像合成的应用。

Method: 该方法通过概率图模块捕获解剖约束，并将这些约束转换为空间二元掩码，这些掩码约束了一个新的反事实去噪 UNet，其编码通过 3D 扩散解码器传输到高质量的脑部 MRI 中。

Result: 在多个数据集上的大量实验表明，PCGM 生成的结构性脑部 MRI 的质量高于几种基线方法。此外，从 PCGM 生成的反事实中提取的脑部测量结果，重现了先前在神经科学文献中报道的疾病对皮质脑区域的微妙影响。

Conclusion: PCGM 的成就是合成 MRI 在研究微妙形态差异方面应用的重要里程碑。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to

novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated

medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Motivation: 现有的多光谱目标检测方法在特征融合过程中常保留多余的背景或噪声，限制了感知性能。

Conclusion: IRDFusion通过迭代反馈逐步放大显著的关系信号，同时抑制特征噪声，从而实现高质量的跨模态融合，并带来显著的性能提升，展示了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA能够在成功保持核心模型性能的同时，显著提高计算效率和推理速度。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,

significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于鸟瞰图（BEV）的 LiDAR 全局定位自监督框架 S-BEVLoc，无需地面实况位姿，且具有高度可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖于从 GPS 或 SLAM 里程计获得的地面实况位姿来监督网络训练，获取高精度地面实况位姿需要大量的成本和精力。

Method: 利用关键点中心 BEV 补丁之间的已知地理距离，从单个 BEV 图像构建训练三元组。使用卷积神经网络 (CNN) 提取局部特征，并采用 NetVLAD 聚合全局描述符。此外，我们引入 SoftCos 损失来加强从生成的三元组中学习。

Result: 在大型 KITTI 和 NCLT 数据集上的实验结果表明，S-BEVLoc 在位置识别、回环闭合和全局定位任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时提供了可扩展性，而监督方法需要额外的努力。

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc 是一种有效的自监督 LiDAR 全局定位方法，具有优越的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Result: 在不同对象大小、遮挡程度和环境下的性能分析。

Conclusion: 发布了FPI-Det数据集和源代码，为相关研究提供支持。

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,
providing baseline results and an analysis of performance across object sizes,
occlusion levels, and environments. Source code and dataset is available at

TL;DR: ZeroPlantSeg: a zero-shot segmentation method for rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting entire plant individuals with multiple overlapping leaves is challenging and typically requires annotated training datasets.

Method: Integrates a foundation segmentation model for leaf instances and a vision-language model for plant structure reasoning, without additional training.

Result: Surpasses existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than supervised methods on datasets with multiple plant species, growth stages, and shooting environments.

Conclusion: Introduces ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation method for rosette-shaped plant individuals.

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

TL;DR: 本文针对CLIP在行人重识别中的应用，提出了数据和模型架构上的协同改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在行人表示学习中面临缺乏大规模高质量数据和全局对比学习局限性的挑战，无法保持判别性局部特征且易受噪声文本干扰。

Method: 1. 构建了一个抗噪声的数据构建流程，利用MLLM自动过滤和标注网络图像，生成大规模行人图像文本对数据集WebPerson。2. 提出了GA-DMS框架，通过梯度注意力相似度自适应地屏蔽噪声文本token，并引入mask token预测目标，提升细粒度语义表示学习。

Result: GA-DMS在多个基准测试中取得了state-of-the-art的性能。

Conclusion: 本文通过数据和模型架构的协同改进，提升了CLIP在行人表示学习中的性能。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET是一个低资源、小样本的PET基础模型，它直接在投影域中运行，并利用潜在扩散模型（LDM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建大规模PET成像基础模型受到标记数据访问受限和计算资源不足的阻碍。为了克服数据稀缺和效率限制。

Method: 该模型采用了Radon掩模增强策略（RMAS）生成大量训练样本，并结合动态多掩模（DMM）机制增强数据多样性。此外，还实施了正/负掩模约束以嵌入严格的几何一致性，并引入透明医学注意力（TMA）以增强原始投影数据中与病灶相关的区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，ALL-PET仅使用500个样本即可实现高质量的sinogram生成，其性能与在大型数据集上训练的模型相当。ALL-PET可以推广到包括低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等任务。

Conclusion: ALL-PET在内存使用低于24GB的情况下高效运行。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索使用人工神经网络进行拓扑估计，作为结构噪声下持续同调方法的一个有吸引力的替代方案。

Method: 该研究训练了一个监督神经网络来预测2D二值图像中的Betti数，并将其与基于cubical complexes和SEDT的持续同调管道进行了比较。使用了合成数据集和真实世界数据集。

Result: 研究结果表明，在噪声下，人工神经网络可以优于持续同调方法，这可能是由于它们能够从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是，尽管仍处于新兴阶段，但使用人工神经网络进行拓扑估计为结构噪声下的持续同调提供了一种引人注目的替代方案。

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的指标评估整体图像质量，导致与人类感知存在差异。受神经心理学见解的启发，我们假设人类对3D场景的识别从根本上涉及对单个对象的关注。

Method: OSIM通过利用对象检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个对象的“对象性”，从而实现以对象为中心的评估。

Result: 用户研究表明，与现有指标相比，OSIM与人类感知更加吻合。

Conclusion: 我们还使用各种方法分析了OSIM的特征。此外，我们还在标准化的实验装置下重新评估了最近的3D重建和生成模型，以阐明该领域的进展。

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Conclusion: 本文统一了数据集、归纳偏置和架构，为推进通用视频理解提供了全面的回顾和指导。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

Method: OCELOT 2023 挑战赛提供了一个包含来自六个器官的重叠细胞检测和组织分割注释的数据集，参与者提交模型以增强对细胞-组织关系的理解。

Result: 参赛者的模型显著提高了对细胞-组织关系的理解。与未包含细胞-组织关系的基线模型相比，最佳参赛作品在测试集上的 F1 值提高了 7.99。

Conclusion: 将多尺度语义信息整合到模型中是必要的，OCELOT 2023 挑战赛为该领域的研究提供了创新策略。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This

Result: 该框架能够获取准确和关键的知识，并通过大量实验证明其性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的KB-VQA框架，通过知识聚焦减少噪声，提高答案准确性。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 高光谱图像虽然光谱信息丰富，但存在特征冗余问题，影响地物分类精度。

Method: 以ZY1F卫星高光谱图像为数据源，选择江西省余干县为研究区，构建了CWSSNet框架，该框架结合多尺度卷积注意力模块，并在wavelet域引入多频带分解和卷积操作。

Result: CWSSNet在余干县的mIoU、mAcc和mF1分别达到74.50%、82.73%和84.94%，在水体、植被和裸地的分类中获得了最高的IoU，且在小样本训练条件下仍保持可靠性能。

Conclusion: CWSSNet框架能有效提升高光谱遥感图像的地物分类精度，并具有良好的鲁棒性和小样本训练性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated
images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection
methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on
human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

Motivation: 在低光照条件下，目标检测至关重要，但由于图像质量下降而具有挑战性。现有方法要么使用有信息损失的 RAW-RGB 图像，要么采用复杂的框架。

Method: 将传统 ISP 流程解构为顺序线性（传感器校准）和非线性（色调映射）子模块，并将它们重塑为通过任务驱动损失优化的可微组件。每个模块都配备了内容感知适应性和物理信息先验，从而能够实现与检测目标对齐的自动 RAW 到 RGB 转换。利用 ISP 流程的内在级联结构，设计了一种自增强机制，以促进子模块之间的协作。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的低光照目标检测方法，通过轻量级的自适应 ISP 插件 Dark-ISP，实现了在黑暗环境中直接处理 Bayer RAW 图像的端到端训练，并在实验中取得了优于现有技术的结果。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the VQualA 2025 Challenge on Visual Quality
Comparison for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), hosted as part of the ICCV 2025
Workshop on Visual Quality Assessment. The challenge aims to evaluate and
enhance the ability of state-of-the-art LMMs to perform open-ended and detailed
reasoning about visual quality differences across multiple images. To this end,
the competition introduces a novel benchmark comprising thousands of
coarse-to-fine grained visual quality comparison tasks, spanning single images,
pairs, and multi-image groups. Each task requires models to provide accurate
quality judgments. The competition emphasizes holistic evaluation protocols,
including 2AFC-based binary preference and multi-choice questions (MCQs).
Around 100 participants submitted entries, with five models demonstrating the
emerging capabilities of instruction-tuned LMMs on quality assessment. This
challenge marks a significant step toward open-domain visual quality reasoning
and comparison and serves as a catalyst for future research on interpretable
and human-aligned quality evaluation systems.

*Ge Sun,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGTraj: A novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for human Trajectory prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction task into two stages and the potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory modeling.

Method: MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive refinements.

Result: MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Conclusion: MGTraj achieves state-of-the-art performance in human trajectory prediction by using a multi-granularity goal-guided model.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

*Jiesi Hu,Jianfeng Cao,Yanwu Yang,Chenfei Ye,Yixuan Zhang,Hanyang Peng,Ting Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medverse是一个用于3D医学图像分析的通用ICL模型，它在多个数据集上进行训练，并在各种任务中优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学图像ICL模型无法同时实现高保真预测和全局解剖学理解，并且缺乏在不同任务和区域上训练的统一模型。

Method: Medverse采用下一代自回归ICL框架，逐步细化预测，并提出了一种分块交叉注意力模块，以促进上下文和目标输入之间的远程交互。

Result: Medverse在广泛的预留数据集上进行了评估，结果表明其性能显著优于现有的ICL基线。

Conclusion: Medverse建立了一种用于上下文学习的新范例，代码和模型权重将公开提供。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胃部疾病的早期诊断至关重要，但组织病理学检查完全手动操作，效率低且易出错。需要自动、可靠和高效的胃组织分析方法。

Method: 该模型基于CoAtNet架构，用增强的ConvNeXtV2块替换其MBConv层，并集成卷积块注意力模块（CBAM）以改善局部特征提取。

Result: 在HMU-GC-HE-30K数据集上，CoAtNeXt的准确率为96.47%，在GasHisSDB数据集上，准确率为98.29%，优于所有测试的CNN和ViT模型。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，CoAtNeXt是一种用于胃组织图像组织病理学分类的强大架构，在二元和多类分类中均表现出色，具有辅助病理学家诊断的潜力。

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个新的大型多模态指令数据集和基准，专门用于全景X光片解读，名为MMOral。作者发现现有模型在该领域存在显著局限性，并提出了OralGPT，通过在MMOral数据集上进行监督微调，显著提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉-语言模型(LVLMs)在通用医疗任务中表现出强大的性能，但在牙科等专业领域中的有效性仍未得到充分探索。全景X光片由于密集的解剖结构和细微的病理线索，带来了解释上的挑战，而现有的医疗基准或指令数据集并未捕捉到这些挑战。

Method: 作者构建了MMOral，一个包含20,563张带注释的图像和130万个指令跟随实例的大规模多模态指令数据集。此外，作者提出了MMOral-Bench，一个涵盖牙科五个关键诊断维度的综合评估套件。作者还提出了OralGPT，通过在Qwen2.5-VL-7B上进行监督微调(SFT)，并使用精心策划的MMOral指令数据集。

Result: 在MMOral-Bench上评估了64个LVLM，发现即使是性能最佳的模型GPT-4o，也仅达到41.45%的准确率。OralGPT通过单epoch的SFT，性能显著提升，例如，OralGPT的性能提高了24.73%。

Conclusion: MMOral和OralGPT作为智能牙科的关键基础，具有巨大的潜力，并能使牙科领域中更具临床影响力的多模态AI系统成为可能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

### [77] [DATE: Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09263)
*Chao Yuan,Yang Yang,Yehui Yang,Zach Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为动态绝对时间增强（DATE）的方法，以提高MLLM在长时间视频理解中的时间感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理需要精确的时间推理和事件定位的长视频理解任务时，存在长程依赖问题，导致关键信息丢失和时间理解能力下降。

Method: 该方法包括时间戳注入机制（TIM）和语义引导的时间感知相似性采样（TASS）策略。TIM将视频帧嵌入与文本时间戳token交错，构建连续的时间参考系统。TASS将视频采样问题转化为视觉-语言检索任务，并采用两阶段算法，确保语义相关性和时间覆盖。

Result: 该方法在绝对时间理解和关键事件定位方面取得了显著改进，在小时级视频基准测试中，7B和72B模型均达到了最先进的性能。7B模型在某些基准测试中甚至超过了许多72B模型。

Conclusion: DATE方法能够有效提升MLLM在长视频理解中的时间感知能力，并在多个基准测试中取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

*Linhao Li,Yiwen Ye,Ziyang Chen,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进剪枝框架PSP-Seg，用于动态高效的3D分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D医学图像分割面临资源和时间消耗大的问题，限制了其在临床环境中的可扩展性和快速部署。现有的高效分割模型通常是静态的，并且在训练前手动设计，这限制了它们在不同任务中的适应性，并且难以平衡性能与资源效率。

Method: PSP-Seg从一个冗余模型开始，并通过块状剪枝和功能解耦损失的组合迭代地剪枝冗余模块。

Result: 轻量级变体PSP-Seg-S在所有数据集上实现了与nnU-Net相当的性能，同时将GPU内存使用量减少了42-45%，训练时间减少了29-48%，参数数量减少了83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg具有作为一种经济高效但高性能的替代方案的潜力，可用于广泛的临床应用。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的图表理解方法，该方法通过可验证的符号格式（Code-as-Thought, CaT）来表示图表的视觉信息，并结合直接视觉分析，使视觉语言模型(VLM)能够动态选择最佳的推理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解方法存在依赖外部工具、缺乏灵活性，以及中间推理步骤难以验证等问题。

Method: 论文提出了一种自适应框架，其中VLM学习在CaT路径和直接视觉推理路径之间进行选择。该模型使用一种新颖的双重奖励系统进行训练，该系统结合了数据准确性奖励和决策奖励。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种图表理解基准测试中表现出强大而稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作表明，可以教导VLM不仅进行推理，还可以学习如何推理，从而为每个任务动态选择最佳的推理路径。

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

*Anthony P. Addison,Felix Wagner,Wentian Xu,Natalie Voets,Konstantinos Kamnitsas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的U-Net架构，可以通过整合模态无关的输入通道和模态特定的输入通道，对训练期间未见过的图像模态进行推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态脑部MRI分割模型通常限于固定的模态，无法有效处理新的模态，并且在推广到未见模态时可能会丢失判别性的模态特定信息。

Method: 通过在U-Net架构中整合模态无关的输入通道，并开发一种合成人工MRI模态的图像增强方案来训练该模态无关组件。

Result: 该方法在包含5种病理类型和8种模态的8个MRI数据库上进行了评估，结果表明该方法保留了有效处理训练期间遇到的MRI模态的能力，同时能够处理新的、未见过的模态以改进其分割。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的模型可以对包含训练期间未见过的图像模态、先前见过的模态以及两者的异构组合的数据执行推理，从而允许用户利用任何可用的成像模态。

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的、与模型无关的开放集检测框架，专为基于嵌入的检测器设计，在动态空对空环境中实现了可靠的无人机感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的封闭集检测器在领域转移和飞行数据损坏的情况下性能显著下降，对安全关键型应用构成风险。

Method: 通过嵌入空间中的熵建模估计语义不确定性，并结合谱归一化和温度缩放来增强开放集判别能力。

Result: 在具有挑战性的AOT航空基准和广泛的真实飞行测试中验证了该方法，与基于YOLO的标准检测器相比，AUROC相对增益高达10%。

Conclusion: 背景抑制进一步增强了鲁棒性，且不影响检测精度，使得该解决方案特别适用于动态空对空环境中可靠的无人机感知。

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

*Oh-Tae Jang,Min-Gon Cho,Kyung-Tae Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SlotSAR的面向对象的学习框架，用于从SAR图像的背景杂波中分离目标表示，无需掩码注释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像包含目标和复杂背景杂波，导致模型提取混杂或虚假的特征，从而削弱了形成清晰目标表示的能力。

Method: SlotSAR首先从SARATR-X中提取高级语义特征，并从小波散射网络中提取低级散射特征，以获得互补的多层次表示，用于鲁棒的目标表征。然后，提出了一个多层次的槽注意力模块，该模块集成了这些低级和高级特征，以增强槽状表示的独特性，从而实现有效的OCL。

Result: SlotSAR在SAR图像中实现了最先进的性能，与现有的OCL方法相比，保留了结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过分离目标和背景杂波，在SAR图像中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MatCha，这是一个用于材料表征图像理解的基准，旨在评估多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)在理解真实材料表征成像数据方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)在材料科学中的生成和预测任务中显示出潜力，但它们理解真实世界表征成像数据的能力仍未被充分探索。为了弥合这一差距，本文提出了MatCha。

Method: MatCha包含1,500个问题，涵盖材料研究的四个关键阶段，包含21个不同的任务，每个任务都旨在反映材料科学家面临的真实挑战。

Result: 对MatCha上最先进的MLLM的评估表明，与人类专家相比，存在显着的性能差距。当解决需要更高级别专业知识和复杂视觉感知的问题时，这些模型表现出退化。

Conclusion: 现有的MLLM对真实世界的材料表征场景的适应性仍然有限。MatCha将促进新材料发现和自主科学代理等领域的未来研究。

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异构协同感知方法需要联合训练或预先存储模型，在实际应用中不切实际。

Method: 提出了一种名为渐进式异构协同感知(PHCP)的新框架，该框架将问题转化为少样本无监督域自适应，通过在推理过程中自训练适配器来动态对齐特征。

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上的大量实验表明，PHCP在各种异构场景中都取得了强大的性能。值得注意的是，PHCP在使用少量未标记数据的情况下，实现了与在整个数据集上训练的SOTA方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: PHCP 可以在不进行联合训练的情况下，仅使用少量未标记数据即可实现与 SOTA 方法相媲美的性能，解决了现有异构协同感知方法在实际应用中的局限性。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型中未被充分利用的纯视觉推理能力。

Method: 对多种双编码器视觉语言模型进行了全面的评估，包括在 ImageNet-1k 验证集上进行标准设置的比较，并分析了影响准确性的关键因素，如提示设计、类别多样性等。

Result: 研究表明，语言和视觉提供互补的优势，有些类别偏爱文本提示，而另一些类别则更适合视觉相似性。

Conclusion: 论文介绍了一种简单的、无学习的融合方法，该方法基于每类精度，可以提高分类性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Current generation AI models magically transform brainstorming into fancy

TL;DR: 本文研究了在少量样本情况下，如何利用自监督预训练提高手术技能自动评估(SSA)的性能。通过在机器人手术数据集上进行实验，发现领域相关的预训练数据比大规模但领域不相关的数据更有效，并且将特定手术的数据纳入预训练可以显著提高下游任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于手术技能标注的稀缺性，开发稳健的SSA模型具有挑战性。少量样本学习(FSL)提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，但其成功取决于有效的预训练。虽然预训练已广泛应用于多个手术下游任务，但在SSA中仍未被探索。

Method: 将SSA构建为一个少量样本任务，并研究自监督预训练策略如何影响下游的少量样本SSA性能。使用客观结构化技术技能评估(OSATS)分数注释公开的机器人手术数据集，并评估各种预训练源在三个少量样本设置中的性能。量化领域相似性，并分析领域差距和将特定程序数据纳入预训练如何影响可迁移性。

Conclusion: 领域相关的预训练数据比大规模但领域不相关的数据更有效，并且将特定手术的数据纳入预训练可以显著提高下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to
catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page:

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,

study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's
reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Method: 本文提出了一种新的方法，用于处理本征图像分解中严重的光照和丰富的纹理。该方法利用先前基于学习的方法倾向于产生无纹理和过度平滑的本征图像这一现象，设计了一个纹理引导的正则化项，并将分解问题转化为一个优化框架，以分离材料纹理和光照效果。

Result: 结合新的纹理感知先验可以产生优于现有方法的结果。

Conclusion: 本文证明了结合新的纹理感知先验可以产生优于现有方法的结果。

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Motivation: 将学习先验与物理正向模型集成，从而解决不适定的逆问题，特别是在单像素成像中。

Method: 通过将扩散过程解耦为三个可解释的阶段：去噪、数据一致性执行和采样，提供了一个统一的框架。然后，提出了一个混合数据一致性模块，该模块将多个 PnP 风格的保真度项线性组合。

Result: 在单像素成像任务上的实验结果表明，该方法实现了更好的重建质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在单像素成像任务中实现了更好的重建质量，因为它在不影响扩散采样轨迹的情况下提高了测量一致性。

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种全自动的颅内压 (ICP) 分级框架，该框架集成了关键帧识别、视神经鞘直径 (ONSD) 测量和临床数据，以实现客观的临床评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑内压 (ICP) 升高对大脑功能构成严重威胁，因此需要进行监测以便及时干预。腰椎穿刺是 ICP 测量的金标准，但其侵入性和相关风险推动了对非侵入性替代方案的需求。视神经鞘直径 (ONSD) 已成为一种有前途的生物标志物，因为 ICP 升高与 ONSD 增加直接相关。当前的 ONSD 测量临床实践存在手动操作不一致、最佳视图选择主观以及阈值设置多变等问题，限制了它们的可靠性。

Method: 该方法包括两个阶段：眼底超声视频处理阶段，执行帧级解剖分割、基于规则的关键帧识别（以国际共识声明为指导）和精确的 ONSD 测量；颅内压分级阶段，融合 ONSD 指标与临床特征，以实现 ICP 等级的预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法实现了 0.845 ± 0.071 的验证准确率（来自五重交叉验证的标准差）和 0.786 的独立测试准确率，显著优于传统的基于阈值的方法（0.637 ± 0.111 的验证准确率，0.429 的测试准确率）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效减少操作者变异性并整合多源信息，建立了一种可靠的非侵入性临床 ICP 评估方法，有望改善急性神经系统疾病患者的管理。

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部正常样本的无监督IC缺陷分割框架，通过学习 нормальной 信息并重建正常内容，利用重建残差分割缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代集成电路制造引入了多种多样的细粒度缺陷，这些缺陷会降低产量和可靠性。大多数工业缺陷分割方法将测试图像与外部正常集进行比较，但这种策略对于IC图像来说是脆弱的，因为IC图像的布局因产品而异，并且难以进行精确对齐。

Method: 该框架包含一个可学习的 нормальной 信息提取器，用于从测试图像中聚合有代表性的 нормальной 特征，并通过一致性损失来加强它们与正常区域的关联。在这些特征的指导下，解码器仅重建正常内容，然后利用重建残差来分割缺陷。伪异常增强进一步稳定了训练。

Result: 在来自三个IC工艺阶段的数据集上进行的实验表明，该方法相对于现有方法具有持续的改进，并且对产品变异性具有很强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种无需外部正常样本的无监督IC缺陷分割框架，实验结果表明该方法优于现有方法，并对产品变异性具有很强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型在临床决策支持方面具有潜力，但其在分布偏移下的可靠性是一个主要问题。这些模型容易学习任务无关的关联，限制了其泛化能力，增加了在实际环境中失败的风险。

Method: 该论文提出了DRiFt框架，该框架使用参数高效调整（LoRA）和可学习的prompt tokens，显式地分离临床相关信号与任务无关的噪声。此外，通过为医学数据集生成captions，构建高质量的图像-文本对，以增强跨模态对齐。

Result: DRiFt框架在分布内性能上提高了+11.4% Top-1准确率和+3.3% Macro-F1，并在未见数据集上保持了强大的鲁棒性。消融研究表明，解耦任务相关特征和仔细对齐可以显著提高模型泛化能力，并减少在领域转移下的不可预测行为。

Conclusion: 该研究的见解有助于构建更安全、更值得信赖的临床用视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

TL;DR: FS-Diff: A semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution method that unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional generation problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fusion techniques produce suboptimal results in real-world applications due to corrupted target and background structures, low resolution, and weak semantic information in multimodal images.

Method: FS-Diff leverages semantic guidance from a clarity sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal feature extraction. It uses bidirectional feature Mamba to extract global features and a modified U-Net network for iterative denoising.

Result: FS-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six public and a new AVMS dataset, recovering richer details and semantics.

Conclusion: FS-Diff is effective for joint image fusion and super-resolution, demonstrating superior performance in recovering details and semantics.

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像级SSL在学习密集patches表示方面面临挑战，同一实例/类别的patches分散，影响下游密集任务的性能。本文旨在通过显式语义集中来解决这个问题。

Method: 1) 提出patch对应关系提炼，打破严格的空间对齐；2) 面对噪声和不平衡的伪标签，提出一种容错排序损失，将平均精度(AP)损失扩展到连续目标；3) 提出对象感知过滤器，将输出空间映射到基于对象的空间，通过交叉注意力用可学习的对象原型表示patches。

Result: 在各种任务上的实验研究表明，该方法是有效的。

Conclusion: 本文提出的显式语义集中方法有效地解决了密集SSL中的过分散问题，并在各种任务上取得了良好的效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Motivation: 现有的融合方法只能处理固定数量的模态输入，这限制了它们在临床环境中的应用。

Method: FlexiD-Fuse将扩散融合问题转化为基于扩散过程和分层贝叶斯建模的最大似然估计问题，并通过将期望最大化算法融入扩散采样迭代过程中。

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse在处理不同模态数量的医学图像融合方面表现出色。

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

TL;DR: 本研究针对撒哈拉以南非洲地区脑胶质瘤MRI分割数据不足的问题，提出了一种高效、准确的深度学习框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在撒哈拉以南非洲地区，高质量带标注的脑胶质瘤MRI数据稀缺，阻碍了先进分割模型在临床工作流程中的应用。

Method: 利用3D Attention UNet架构，结合残差块，并通过在BraTS 2021数据集上预训练的权重进行迁移学习。

Result: 在BraTS-Africa数据集上，增强肿瘤(ET)的Dice系数为0.76，坏死和非增强肿瘤核心(NETC)的Dice系数为0.80，周围非功能半球(SNFH)的Dice系数为0.85。

Conclusion: 该模型具有良好的泛化能力，有助于在资源匮乏的环境中支持临床决策，同时模型体积小，推理速度快，易于部署。

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 Deepfake 检测数据集通常有限，依赖于过时的生成方法、低真实度或单人脸图像，限制了通用合成图像检测的有效性。Deepfakes加剧了错误信息的传播，尤其是在政治敏感的背景下。

Method: 通过分析社交媒体帖子，识别 Deepfakes 传播错误信息的多种方式。构建了一个包含 300 万张真实图像和 963k 张高质量合成图像的数据集，这些图像来自专有和开源模型。引入了一个众包对抗平台，参与者可以生成并提交具有挑战性的合成图像。

Result: 最近开发的专有模型生成的合成图像越来越难以与真实图像区分，使得公众难以准确识别。

Conclusion: 该数据集和众包平台能够帮助 Deepfake 检测方法保持鲁棒性和适应性，主动保护公共领域免受复杂的错误信息威胁。

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的损失项，它强制生成的动量分布与地面实况数据中的动量分布之间的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究通常将人体运动分解为根关节坐标系中的局部运动和世界坐标系中根关节的全局运动，并将它们分开处理。然而，这两个分量不是独立的。全局运动是由与环境的相互作用产生的，而环境的相互作用又是身体结构变化驱动的。运动模型通常不能精确地捕捉局部和全局动力学之间的物理耦合，而从关节扭矩和外力推导全局轨迹在计算上是昂贵和复杂的。

Method: 利用整体线性和角动量作为约束，将局部运动与全局运动联系起来。引入一个新的损失项，它强制生成的动量分布与地面实况数据中的动量分布之间的一致性。

Result: 减少了脚的滑动和抖动，提高了平衡性，并保持了恢复运动的准确性。

Conclusion: 利用动量作为约束，将局部运动与全局运动联系起来，可以提高运动模型的性能。

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种预测原始漫画线条艺术图像之间区域对应关系的新任务，无需任何预先存在的标签或掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解漫画线条艺术图像之间区域对应关系是漫画处理中的一项基本任务，可以实现自动线条艺术着色和中间帧生成等下游应用。然而，这项任务在很大程度上尚未被探索，尤其是在没有预先存在的分割或注释的实际场景中。

Method: 我们将每个线条艺术图像分成一组补丁，并提出了一个基于Transformer的框架，该框架学习图像内部和跨图像的补丁级相似性。然后，我们应用边缘感知聚类和区域匹配算法，将补丁级预测转换为连贯的区域级对应关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，我们的方法实现了高补丁级精度（例如，96.34%），并生成了一致的区域级对应关系。

Conclusion: 该方法具有在实际漫画应用中的潜力

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

<details>

Motivation: 多视图聚类(MVC)通过整合来自多个视图的异构数据来增强聚类分析，但多视图融合存在低质量数据的问题，这些问题主要由噪声数据和缺失数据引起。

Method: 本文提出了一个新颖的随机生成扩散融合(SGDF)方法。SGDF利用多重生成机制来处理每个样本的多视图特征，对低质量数据具有鲁棒性。在此基础上，进一步提出了生成扩散对比网络(GDCN)。

Result: 大量的实验表明，GDCN在深度MVC任务中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的基于随机生成扩散融合(SGDF)的多视图聚类(MVC)方法，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/GDCN.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双编码器架构 DualTrack，用于从 2D 超声图像序列估计 3D 探头轨迹，实现无传感器 3D 超声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 3D 超声系统成本高且复杂，限制了其广泛应用。无传感器 3D 超声是一种有前途的替代方案，但现有方法未能充分利用局部和全局特征。

Method: 设计了 DualTrack，它包含解耦的局部和全局编码器，分别用于提取细粒度的局部特征和高级全局特征。局部编码器使用密集时空卷积，全局编码器使用图像主干和时间注意力层。最后，使用轻量级融合模块组合这些特征来估计轨迹。

Result: 在大型公共基准测试中，DualTrack 实现了最先进的精度和全局一致的 3D 重建，优于以前的方法，平均重建误差低于 5 毫米。

Conclusion: DualTrack 能够有效利用局部和全局特征，实现精确的无传感器 3D 超声重建。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究较少关注提高视频扩散模型的特征表示能力。本文旨在探索如何通过对齐视频生成器与预训练视觉编码器的特征来改进视频扩散模型。

Method: 1. 提出一种新的指标，深入分析各种视觉编码器的区分性和时间一致性，评估其视频特征对齐的适用性。2. 基于分析，提出Align4Gen，一种新的多特征融合与对齐方法，集成到视频扩散模型训练中。

Result: Align4Gen在无条件和类条件视频生成任务中都表现出改进的视频生成效果，并通过各种指标进行量化。

Conclusion: 通过将视频生成器的中间特征与预训练视觉编码器的特征表示对齐，可以有效提高视频扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this
area, the dataset is publicly available at

Motivation: 探讨深度学习算法在MRI图像AD诊断中shortcut learning和人口统计偏见的可能性，尤其关注种族和性别差异。

Method: 1. 验证深度学习算法是否能从3D脑部MRI扫描中识别种族或性别，以确定是否存在基于种族和性别的分布偏移。2. 研究基于种族或性别的训练集不平衡是否会导致模型性能下降。3. 对受保护属性和AD分类任务中不同脑区域的特征归因进行定量和定性分析。

Result: 证明了基于深度学习的AD分类中，确实存在基于种族和性别的shortcut learning和偏见。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建更公平的基于深度学习的脑部MRI诊断工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Motivation: 解决多时相和多源遥感图像中伪变化普遍、标记样本稀缺和跨域泛化困难的问题。

Method: 采用基于VFM的权重共享Siamese编码器，并集成LoRA和Adapter模块，通过训练少量额外参数实现高效的任务适应。探索了两个backbone：具有强大分割先验的SAM2和state-of-the-art的自监督表示学习器DINOv3。框架配有一个轻量级解码器。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上实现了state-of-the-art的性能，包括SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%)、WHUCD (92.05%)、MSRSCD (64.07%)、MLCD (76.89%)、CDD (97.01%)、S2Looking (52.25%)和LEVIR-CD (85.62%)，具有精确的边界划分和对伪变化的强大抑制。

Conclusion: PeftCD在准确性、效率和泛化性之间实现了最佳平衡，为将大规模VFM适应于实际遥感变化检测应用提供了一个强大且可扩展的范例。

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at
https://github.com/dyzy41/PeftCD.

Conclusion: Talk2Event可以作为推进多模态和时间感知的基础，应用于机器人、人机交互等领域。

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

Motivation: 现实世界的应用中，通常只能获得专家提供的区间范围估计，而传统的贝叶斯推断假设输入值为精确值，这不符合实际。

Method: 1. 开发了一种新的保守方法，以避免输入IT2 MFs中的潜在不一致性，从而产生有效的输出结果。2. 描述了一种新颖而灵活的算法，用于将专家提供的区间编码为IT2模糊隶属函数（MFs），可用于指定贝叶斯定理中的输入概率。

Result: 未提及具体结果

Conclusion: 本文通过扩展贝叶斯定理到区间二型版本，解决现实世界应用中输入概率的不确定性问题，并为专家知识的编码提供了一种新方法。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated game template generation
by transforming Game Design Documents (GDDs) into functional Unity game

extracts structured game specifications, and synthesizes Unity-compatible C#
code that implements the core mechanics, systems, and architecture defined in
the design documentation. Our approach combines a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model
specialized for Unity code generation with a custom Unity integration package
that streamlines the implementation process. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model
achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to
state-of-the-art LLMs across compilation success, GDD adherence, best practices
adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high
adherence to GDD specifications across multiple game genres. Our system
effectively addresses critical gaps in AI-assisted game development,
positioning LLMs as valuable tools in streamlining the transition from game

### [111] [Global Constraint LLM Agents for Text-to-Model Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08970)
*Junyang Cai,Serdar Kadioglu,Bistra Dilkina*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用多个专门的LLM智能体，通过全局约束类型分解建模任务，将自然语言描述的优化或满足问题转换成正确的MiniZinc模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将优化或满足问题的自然语言描述翻译成正确的MiniZinc模型具有挑战性，因为这个过程需要逻辑推理和约束编程方面的专业知识。

Method: 引入了一个agentic框架，该框架使用多个专门的LLM智能体，通过全局约束类型来分解建模任务。每个智能体都致力于检测和生成特定类别的全局约束的代码，而最终的组装智能体将这些约束片段集成到完整的MiniZinc模型中。

Result: 通过将问题分解为更小的、定义明确的子任务，每个LLM处理一个更简单的推理挑战，从而可能降低整体复杂性。我们使用多个LLM进行了初步实验，并表明与one-shot prompting和chain-of-thought prompting等基线相比，性能更好。

Conclusion: 我们概述了未来工作的综合路线图，强调了潜在的增强和改进方向。

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

*Soheil Zibakhsh Shabgahi,Pedram Aghazadeh,Azalia Mirhosseini,Farinaz Koushanfar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 模型在合成数据上重复训练会导致模型崩溃，性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复训练合成数据会导致模型崩溃，现有的缓解策略有限。

Method: 提出了一种置信度感知损失函数，称为截断交叉熵（TCE），在训练期间降低高置信度预测的权重。

Result: TCE 显著延迟了递归训练中的模型崩溃，并将模型的保真度间隔延长了 2.3 倍以上。

Conclusion: 损失函数的设计为在合成数据时代保持生成模型的质量提供了一种简单而强大的工具。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究关注可解释人工智能（XAI）领域，特别是全局解释和不确定性解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI研究缺乏对全局解释和不确定性解释的关注，通用指南仍待完善。

Method: 选择了一个能同时覆盖不确定性、鲁棒性和全局XAI等概念的算法，并测试其校准信任的能力。同时，检验了一种旨在提供更直观视觉理解的算法是否能提供更高的用户满意度和人类可解释性。

Result: 论文测试了算法校准信任的能力，并检验了提供直观视觉理解的算法对用户满意度和可解释性的影响。

Conclusion: 研究着重于XAI的全局解释和不确定性解释，并考察了算法在校准信任和提供直观视觉理解方面的表现。

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

*Haowei Yang,Yushang Zhao,Sitao Min,Bo Su,Chao Yao,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用少量样本的大型语言模型（LLM）来优化推荐任务中的指令提示的有效流程，以解决冷启动用户问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动用户问题会进一步降低推荐系统的有效性，因为它限制了对历史行为信息的访问。

Method: 本文介绍了一种上下文条件提示公式化方法P(u, Ds) -> R̂，其中u是冷启动用户画像，Ds是精选的支持集，R̂是预测的排序项目列表。该方法利用token-level对齐和嵌入空间正则化，以获得更高的语义保真度。

Result: 通过对基于transformer的自回归LLM（BioGPT、LLaMA-2、GPT-4）的系统实验，本文提供了经验证据，表明最佳的示例注入和指令结构可以显著提高这些模型在低数据设置中的precision@k和NDCG分数。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果表明，及时的组合不仅是句法的，而且是功能性的，因为它直接控制注意力尺度和解码器通过推理进行引导。基于提示的适配可以被认为是解决基于LLM的管道中冷启动推荐问题的一种方法。

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 对比了人类、大型语言模型（llm）和贝叶斯智能体在动态协商环境中的表现，发现性能相似，行为方式迥异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估智能体在动态、多智能体环境中协商过程的重要性，并研究不同智能体的优势。

Method: 在动态协商环境中直接比较人类、GPT-4o、Gemini 1.5 Pro和贝叶斯智能体的行为和结果。

Result: 贝叶斯智能体通过激进优化获得最高收益，但交易拒绝率高；人类和llm获得相似的总收益，但llm倾向于保守的让步交易，而人类更策略性、冒险和注重公平。

Conclusion: 性能对等可能会掩盖过程和一致性的根本差异，这对于实际部署至关重要。

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.961
with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.005. The proposed pipeline achieved second

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个受神经科学启发的agentic空间智能计算框架，旨在弥合人工智能体在空间推理能力上与人类的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的agentic AI系统在空间推理能力方面存在局限性，无法很好地与物理3D世界交互。人类的空间智能基于多感官感知、空间记忆和认知地图，能够在非结构化环境中进行灵活的决策。

Method: 本文从计算神经科学中研究的空间神经模型入手，构建了一个新的计算框架，该框架将核心生物学功能映射到六个关键计算模块：受生物学启发的模态感知、多感官融合、以自我为中心的-以自我为中心的转换、人工认知地图、空间记忆和空间推理。

Result: 该框架为agentic空间推理能力提供了一个全面的视角，并用于分析现有方法、评估基准和数据集，以及探索潜在的应用领域。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个有前景的路线图，可以推广跨动态或非结构化环境的空间推理，并希望这项工作能够为研究社区带来神经科学的视角和结构化的路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了智能体之间交互的演变性质。

Method: 利用动态异构图进行场景建模，并设计了一种分解架构来处理未来场景中的时空依赖关系，逐步消除未来运动的不确定性。此外，还加入了多尺度解码程序。

Result: 在INTERACTION和Argoverse 2基准测试中取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: ProgD 能够更准确地预测周围智能体的运动。

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Method: 设计了一个包含代理层、区块链数据层和监管应用层的分层架构，并设计了三个关键模块：代理行为追踪和仲裁模块、动态声誉评估模块和恶意行为预测模块。

Result: 该方法为大型代理生态系统中可信、弹性且可扩展的监管机制奠定了系统基础。

Conclusion: 讨论了多代理系统中基于区块链的监管框架的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）在自动化数据科学工作流程方面表现出巨大的潜力，但现有的模型仍然难以进行多步骤推理和工具使用，这限制了它们在复杂数据分析任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning
and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,
respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.
Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use
reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

Motivation: 研究在各种锦标赛规则下，为什么一个候选人能成为获胜者，并提供可信的解释。

Method: 通过识别最小支持（候选人保证获胜的最小子锦标赛）来提供解释。关注常见的锦标赛解决方案，并确定最小支持的大小。

Result: 对于每条规则，确定了最小支持的大小，并为除加权无覆盖集之外的所有规则提出了多项式时间算法。对于加权无覆盖集，问题是 NP 完全的。

Conclusion: 最小支持可以用于生成紧凑、经过认证且直观的解释。

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一个更全面、真实的机器学习任务评估基准（TAM Bench），用于评估基于LLM的智能体在端到端机器学习任务中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准在任务覆盖范围、领域多样性、难度建模和评估严格性方面存在局限性，无法捕捉LLM智能体在实际环境中的全部能力。

Method: 开发了一个浏览器自动化和LLM驱动的任务获取系统，能够自动从Kaggle等平台收集和组织机器学习挑战；使用排行榜驱动的难度建模机制，通过参与者数量和分数分散程度来估计任务复杂性；构建了一个多维度评估框架，包含性能、格式合规性、约束遵守和任务泛化能力。

Result: 构建了包含150个AutoML任务的三个不同大小的基准子集（Lite, Medium, Full），Lite版本包含18个任务，并在模态和难度级别上实现了平衡覆盖，适用于日常基准测试和比较研究。

Conclusion: TAM Bench提供了一个多样、真实和结构化的基准，用于评估基于LLM的智能体在端到端机器学习任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

Motivation: 传统的强化学习方法难以平衡高效探索和语义理解，因为智能体的策略认知能力有限，通常需要人工干预。

Method: 通过分层奖励函数整合视觉-语言模型（VLM）的常识，并将VLM查询建模为专用动作，使智能体仅在必要时才策略性地查询VLM以获得外部指导，从而节约资源。结合课程学习策略，在不同复杂程度的层次上指导学习，以确保稳健和稳定的学习。

Conclusion: 该研究通过展示一种将常识语义推理与自主智能体相结合的实用且可扩展的方法，为在机器人技术中追求完全智能化和自我引导的探索提供了一种新颖的方法。

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为模板导向推理 (TORSO) 的方法，旨在激发大型语言模型 (LLM) 的内部推理能力，使其无需手动设计的少量样本示例即可生成适当的响应，从而解决现有方法依赖少量样本提示和构建任务特定提示成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于提供的示例，限制了模型固有的推理能力。构建特定任务的少量样本提示通常成本高昂，并且可能导致不同任务之间出现不一致。

Method: 提出模板导向推理 (TORSO) 方法，引导模型利用内部推理能力，无需手动制作的少量样本示例即可跨各种任务生成适当的响应。

Result: 实验结果表明，TORSO 在各种 LLM 基准测试中取得了良好的性能，并具有合理的理由。

Conclusion: TORSO 能够有效激发 LLM 的内部推理能力，并在各种任务中实现强大的性能。

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法容易出现噪声积累、内存无控制扩展以及跨领域泛化能力有限等问题。

Method: SEDM集成了基于可重现回放的可验证写入准入、根据经验效用动态排序和整合条目的自调度内存控制器，以及支持跨异构任务转移的跨领域知识扩散。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估表明，与强大的内存基线相比，SEDM提高了推理准确性，同时减少了token开销，并进一步实现了从事实验证中提取的知识来增强多跳推理。

Conclusion: SEDM是一种可扩展且可持续的内存机制，适用于开放式的多智能体协作。

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI工具，如视觉-语言模型，缺乏组合泛化能力。先前的研究尝试使用基于张量的组合句子语义来解决这个问题，但结果不理想。

Method: 该研究将组合张量模型的表示解释为希尔伯特空间，并训练变分量子电路来学习这些表示，应用于需要组合泛化的图像描述任务。使用了两种图像编码技术：二进制图像向量上的多热编码（MHE）和来自视觉-语言模型CLIP的图像向量上的角度/幅度编码。

Result: 使用噪声MHE编码获得了良好的概念验证结果。在CLIP图像向量上的表现好坏参半，但仍然优于经典的组合模型。

Conclusion: 量子模型在视觉-语言模型中组合泛化能力方面具有潜力，但仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Motivation: 传统串行计算模式在确保准确性的同时，在实现实际应用所需的“思考”频率方面面临重大限制。

Method: Auras分离了感知和生成，并为它们提供受控的流水线并行性，以实现高而稳定的吞吐量。面对并行性增加时出现的数据陈旧性问题，Auras为感知和生成建立了一个公共上下文以共享，从而保证了具身代理的准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，Auras平均提高了2.54倍的吞吐量，同时达到了原始准确率的102.7%，证明了其在克服顺序计算的约束和提供高吞吐量方面的有效性。

Conclusion: Auras有效地克服了顺序计算的约束，并提供了高吞吐量。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy
of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by
2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating
its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and
providing high throughput.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）的持续扩展是否会产生收益递减？


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的价值通常源于智能体可以完成的任务的长度。我们观察到一个简单但违反直觉的事实：单步准确率的边际收益可以复合成模型可以成功完成的任务长度的指数级改进。

Method: 通过显式提供解决长时程任务所需的知识和计划来隔离执行能力。

Result: 我们发现，即使小型模型具有 100% 的单步准确率，大型模型也可以正确执行更多轮次。我们观察到，模型的每步准确率会随着步数的增加而降低。这不仅仅是由于长上下文限制——奇怪的是，我们观察到了一种自我调节效应——当上下文包含它们之前轮次的错误时，模型更有可能犯错误。自我调节不会通过仅缩放模型大小来减少。相比之下，最近的思维模型不会进行自我调节，并且可以在一轮中执行更长的任务。我们通过在单轮中执行的任务长度上对前沿思维模型进行基准测试来结束。

Conclusion: 通过关注执行能力，我们希望调和关于 LLM 如何解决复杂的推理问题，但在任务变长时却在简单任务上失败的争论，并强调扩展模型大小和长时程任务的顺序测试时计算的巨大好处。

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

Result: 实验表明，基于计数的嵌入为事件数据中活动之间的分布相似性提供了高效的基础。

Conclusion: 基于计数的嵌入方法在活动相似性评估方面是有效且高效的。

Abstract: To obtain insights from event data, advanced process mining methods assess
the similarity of activities to incorporate their semantic relations into the
analysis. Here, distributional similarity that captures similarity from
activity co-occurrences is commonly employed. However, existing work for
distributional similarity in process mining adopt neural network-based
approaches as developed for natural language processing, e.g., word2vec and
autoencoders. While these approaches have been shown to be effective, their
downsides are high computational costs and limited interpretability of the
learned representations.
  In this work, we argue for simplicity in the modeling of distributional
similarity of activities. We introduce count-based embeddings that avoid a
complex training process and offer a direct interpretable representation. To
underpin our call for simple embeddings, we contribute a comprehensive
benchmarking framework, which includes means to assess the intrinsic quality of
embeddings, their performance in downstream applications, and their
computational efficiency. In experiments that compare against the state of the
art, we demonstrate that count-based embeddings provide a highly effective and
efficient basis for distributional similarity between activities in event data.

*Agapi Rissaki,Ilias Fountalis,Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Benny Kimelfeld*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for explaining machine learning models over relational databases by generating view definitions that highlight important parts of the database contributing to the model's prediction. It adapts the concept of determinacy and offers control over granularity. The framework is tested on hetero-GNNs using heuristic algorithms and evaluated on the RelBench collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining the predictions of complex deep learning models over relational databases (like hetero-GNNs) is difficult because their complexity makes it hard to understand how they use data to make predictions.

Method: The paper presents a framework that generates view definitions to highlight the most influential parts of the database for a model's prediction. It uses determinacy and allows for different levels of granularity in the explanations. Heuristic algorithms are developed to avoid exhaustive searches.

Result: The framework's usefulness and the efficiency of explanation generation are demonstrated through an empirical study on the RelBench collection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides useful and efficiently generated explanations for machine learning models over relational databases, as demonstrated by experiments on hetero-GNNs and the RelBench collection.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of
deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based
on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph
transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and
links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical
expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it
hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available
data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for
explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where
explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database
that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global
abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,
Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between
determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of
granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones
highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of
tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case
of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive
search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are
model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of
learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical
study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different
record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.

Motivation: 分析AI搜索和传统web搜索在信息来源上的差异，并为新的生成式搜索环境下的内容可见性提供策略框架。

Method: 通过一系列大规模对照实验，跨多个垂直领域、语言和查询释义，量化分析AI搜索和传统web搜索在信息来源上的关键差异。

Result: AI搜索系统性地偏向于第三方权威媒体来源(Earned media)，而Google的来源更加平衡。AI搜索服务在领域多样性、时效性、跨语言稳定性以及对措辞的敏感性方面彼此差异显著。

Conclusion: 基于实证结果，提出了一个战略性的GEO议程，强调了为机器可扫描性和论证而设计的必要性，通过主导赢得媒体来建立AI感知权威，采用引擎特定和语言感知的策略，并克服小众参与者的固有“大品牌偏见”。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving
from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This
shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and
necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization
(GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and
traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled
experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we
quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key
findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias
towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and
Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further
demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in
their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to
phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We
provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need
to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2)
dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt
engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent
"big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational
empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the
new generative search landscape.

TL;DR: MambaRec: a multimodal recommendation framework using attention-guided learning for local feature alignment and global distribution regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal recommendation systems have limitations in modeling fine-grained cross-modal associations and lack global distribution-level consistency, leading to suboptimal fusion quality and representational bias.

Method: Proposes MambaRec, which integrates a Dilated Refinement Attention Module (DREAM) for fine-grained semantic alignment and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with contrastive loss for global modality alignment. It also employs dimensionality reduction for scalability.

Result: MambaRec outperforms existing methods in fusion quality, generalization, and efficiency on real-world e-commerce datasets.

Conclusion: MambaRec effectively addresses the limitations of existing multimodal recommendation systems by improving cross-modal semantic modeling and enhancing semantic consistency.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly becoming foundational
technologies for e-commerce and content platforms, enabling personalized
services by jointly modeling users' historical behaviors and the multimodal
features of items (e.g., visual and textual). However, most existing methods
rely on either static fusion strategies or graph-based local interaction
modeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model
fine-grained cross-modal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality;
and (2) a lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing
representational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework
that integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization
via attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement
Attention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with
channel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns
between visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical
relationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic
modeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive
loss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic
consistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and
boosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs a dimensionality
reduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-dimensional
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets
show that MambaRec outperforms existing methods in fusion quality,
generalization, and efficiency. Our code has been made publicly available at

### [140] [CESRec: Constructing Pseudo Interactions for Sequential Recommendation via Conversational Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09342)
*Yifan Wang,Shen Gao,Jiabao Fang,Rui Yan,Billy Chiu,Shuo Shang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架CESRec，它集成了SRS的长期偏好建模和CRS的实时偏好提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SRS方法通常依赖于协同过滤信号，无法捕捉实时的用户偏好，而CRS擅长通过自然语言交互来引出即时兴趣，但忽略了历史行为。为了弥合这一差距。

Method: 我们引入了基于语义的伪交互构建，通过分析对话反馈来动态更新用户的历史交互序列，生成一个无缝结合长期和实时偏好的伪交互序列。此外，我们通过提出双重对齐离群项目屏蔽来减少历史项目中偏离用户核心偏好的离群值的影响，该方法使用语义协作对齐表示来识别和屏蔽这些项目。

Result: 大量实验表明，CESRec通过增强强大的SRS模型实现了最先进的性能，验证了其在将对话反馈集成到SRS中的有效性。

Conclusion: CESRec有效地集成了会话反馈到序列推荐系统中，并在实验中表现出最好的性能。

Abstract: Sequential Recommendation Systems (SRS) have become essential in many
real-world applications. However, existing SRS methods often rely on
collaborative filtering signals and fail to capture real-time user preferences,
while Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS) excel at eliciting immediate
interests through natural language interactions but neglect historical
behavior. To bridge this gap, we propose CESRec, a novel framework that
integrates the long-term preference modeling of SRS with the real-time
preference elicitation of CRS. We introduce semantic-based pseudo interaction
construction, which dynamically updates users'historical interaction sequences
by analyzing conversational feedback, generating a pseudo-interaction sequence
that seamlessly combines long-term and real-time preferences. Additionally, we
reduce the impact of outliers in historical items that deviate from users'core
preferences by proposing dual alignment outlier items masking, which identifies
and masks such items using semantic-collaborative aligned representations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CESRec achieves state-of-the-art
performance by boosting strong SRS models, validating its effectiveness in
integrating conversational feedback into SRS.

*Alan Said,Maria Soledad Pera,Michael D. Ekstrand*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: recommender systems research has not addressed fundamental flaws identified in 2011, leading to superficial progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper revisits a critique from 2011 that recommender systems research was flawed, and argues that these issues persist despite increased complexity.

Method: The paper draws on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental impact, and participatory design to showcase the field's shortcomings. It highlights community-led initiatives for change.

Result: The paper contends that meaningful change requires a fundamental reframing of the purpose, stakeholders, and knowledge production in recommender systems research.

Conclusion: The paper calls for a recommender systems research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable practice, advocating for technical reform and a shift in perspective.

Abstract: In 2011, Xavier Amatriain sounded the alarm: recommender systems research was
"doing it all wrong" [1]. His critique, rooted in statistical misinterpretation
and methodological shortcuts, remains as relevant today as it was then. But
rather than correcting course, we added new layers of sophistication on top of
the same broken foundations. This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and
argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural
failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms. Drawing
on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental
impact, and participatory design, we showcase how the field's accelerating
complexity has outpaced its introspection. We highlight ongoing community-led
initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation
frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the
same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics
or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems
research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated.
Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems
research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable
practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言密集检索旨在基于统一的检索模型检索不同语言的相关文档。 挑战在于对齐共享向量空间中不同语言的表示。

Method: 通过获取高质量的硬负样本和有效的小批量数据来提高多语言密集检索的数据利用率。

Result: 在包含 16 种语言的多语言检索基准 MIRACL 上的大量实验结果表明，该方法优于现有的一些强基线，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提高数据利用率，改进了多语言密集检索。

Abstract: Multilingual dense retrieval aims to retrieve relevant documents across
different languages based on a unified retriever model. The challenge lies in
aligning representations of different languages in a shared vector space. The
common practice is to fine-tune the dense retriever via contrastive learning,
whose effectiveness highly relies on the quality of the negative sample and the
efficacy of mini-batch data. Different from the existing studies that focus on
developing sophisticated model architecture, we propose a method to boost data
utilization for multilingual dense retrieval by obtaining high-quality hard
negative samples and effective mini-batch data. The extensive experimental
results on a multilingual retrieval benchmark, MIRACL, with 16 languages
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by outperforming several existing
strong baselines.

Motivation: 研究动机在于了解互联网平台上的在线医疗咨询服务，以及这些平台是否反映了医疗保健领域中固有的不平等现象。

Method: 从AskDoc subreddit下载2020年1月至2022年5月的数据，通过正则表达式识别帖子中自我报告的人口统计信息（性别、种族和年龄），并进行统计分析，了解同行和医生与发帖者之间的互动。

Result: 一半的帖子没有收到同行或医生的评论；至少90%的人透露了性别和年龄，80%的人没有透露种族；该subreddit主要由成年（20-39岁）白人男性主导；在用户与特定人口统计信息的发帖者之间的互动中观察到了一些差异。

Conclusion: 社交媒体可以将患者和提供者更紧密地联系在一起，但目前的医生参与度较低。

Abstract: The objective of this study is to understand the online Ask the Doctor
services medical advice on internet platforms via AskDoc, a Reddit community
that serves as a public AtD platform and study if platforms mirror existing
hurdles and partiality in healthcare across various demographic groups. We
downloaded data from January 2020 to May 2022 from AskDoc -- a subreddit, and
created regular expressions to identify self-reported demographics (Gender,
Race, and Age) from the posts, and performed statistical analysis to understand
the interaction between peers and physicians with the posters. Half of the
posts did not receive comments from peers or physicians. At least 90% of the
people disclose their gender and age, and 80% of the people do not disclose
their race. It was observed that the subreddit is dominated by adult (age group
20-39) white males. Some disparities were observed in the engagement between
the users and the posters with certain demographics. Beyond the confines of
clinics and hospitals, social media could bring patients and providers closer
together, however, as observed, current physicians participation is low
compared to posters.

Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally
sensitive and high-stakes area. We propose a telecom-specific
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge,
the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from
authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess
retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which
our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our
approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In
particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval
yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline
results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that
carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an
effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code

Motivation: 在高风险应用中，评估神经网络的样本不确定性量化至关重要。现有的additive分解方法受到质疑。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的不确定性估计和分解框架，并用实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的矩阵乘法权重更新（MMWU）算法，用于解决矩阵形式的专家建议学习（LEA）问题，该算法在不增加计算复杂性的前提下，实现了实例最优的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MMWU算法在矩阵LEA问题上实现了minimax最优遗憾界，但本文旨在进一步优化该遗憾界。

Method: 本文首先为矩阵LEA开发了一个通用的基于势的框架，并利用拉普拉斯变换技术提出了一个新的“单边”Jensen迹不等式，从而可以将一般势函数应用于矩阵LEA。然后，基于虚误差函数，从向量LEA问题中导出了一个最优势函数，并用其推导出新的算法。

Result: 本文提出的算法实现了实例最优的遗憾界O(√T⋅S(X||d−1Id))，并在量子学习理论中优于现有技术，例如学习被去极化噪声、随机量子态和吉布斯态破坏的量子态。此外，该算法还可用于预测非线性量子特性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的改进MMWU算法在矩阵LEA问题上具有优越的性能，并且在量子学习领域具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在奖励信号受到对抗破坏的强化学习中学习最优策略的问题，提出了一种新的Q-learning算法的鲁棒变体，即使在部分观测到的奖励被破坏的情况下也能有效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决经典算法（如Q-learning）在奖励信号受到对抗破坏时性能严重下降的问题，这种破坏可能来自极端噪声、传感器故障或恶意攻击。

Method: 提出了一种新的Q-learning算法的鲁棒变体，并利用改进的Azuma-Hoeffding不等式。

Result: 在异步采样模型下，即使存在对抗破坏，该算法的有限时间收敛速度与非对抗情况下的现有结果相匹配，只是增加了一个与损坏样本比例相关的附加项。此外，还推导出一个信息论下界，表明上界中的附加损坏项是不可避免的。

Conclusion: 该研究为异步Q-learning提供了第一个有限时间鲁棒性保证，弥合了鲁棒强化学习中的一个重要差距。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在具有多个异构数据生成源的应用程序中，标准的 ML 方法通常学习虚假的相关性，这些相关性平均表现良好，但会降低非典型或代表性不足的组的性能。以往的研究通过优化最差组的性能来解决这个问题。然而，这些方法通常假设可以使用训练数据准确估计每个组的底层数据分布，但在嘈杂、非平稳和不断变化的环境中，这一条件经常被违反。

Method: 我们开发了一种梯度下降-上升算法来解决所提出的 DRO 问题，并提供收敛结果。

Result: 在真实世界的数据上验证了我们方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个基于 Wasserstein 的分布鲁棒优化 (DRO) 框架，以解决每个组内的分布不确定性问题，同时保留了提高最差组性能的目标。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

TL;DR: FoundationalECGNet: A new framework for automated ECG classification that achieves high accuracy across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and scalable diagnostic systems for cardiovascular diseases are needed due to their high mortality rate. Current ECG analysis methods are limited by noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity.

Method: A foundational framework that integrates dual-stage denoising, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Time Series Transformers (TST) to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. It classifies ECG signals in two stages: Normal vs. Abnormal, and then classifies Abnormal signals into specific cardiac conditions.

Result: Achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal classification and state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease detection, including high F1-scores for Conduction Disorders, Hypertrophy, and Arrhythmias. Also provides risk level estimations.

Conclusion: FoundationalECGNet is a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic precision and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

Motivation: 为了阐明归因值的分布

Method: 推导了奇异值的上限，并推导了归因图值的分量上限。将这些分量上限应用于获得乘法常数。

Result: 这些常数控制着归因的经验均值向归因图的期望的收敛。对于将多个非几何数据增强应用于单个测试样本以及对于 Smoothgrad 型归因方法，这一发现具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 我们的分析表明，LRP-beta 的常数仍然独立于权重范数，这与基于梯度的方法和 LRP-epsilon 都有显着区别。

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

TL;DR: 联邦学习可以通过利用碳强度的区域和时间变化来减少碳排放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模机器学习模型的训练会产生大量的碳排放。联邦学习通过在地理上分散的客户端上分配计算，提供了一个利用碳强度 (CI) 区域和时间变化的自然框架。

Method: 本文研究了如何通过碳感知客户端选择和训练调度来减少联邦学习中的排放。我们首先量化了碳感知调度策略的减排效果，该策略利用了空闲时间——允许适度延长训练时间，以便客户端可以将本地训练轮次推迟到低碳时期。然后，我们检查了这种调度带来的性能权衡，这些权衡源于客户端之间的统计异质性、参与中的选择偏差以及模型更新中的时间相关性。为了利用这些权衡，我们构建了一个碳感知调度器，该调度器集成了空闲时间、α-公平碳分配和全局微调阶段。

Result: 在真实 CI 数据上的实验表明，我们的调度器优于与时隙无关的基线，在各种碳预算下实现了更高的模型精度，尤其是在严格的碳约束下获得了强大的收益。

Conclusion: 碳感知调度器在各种碳预算下实现了更高的模型精度，尤其是在严格的碳约束下获得了强大的收益。

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

Motivation: 问答(QA)模拟器是一种模仿真实学生学习行为并预测他们回答问题正确性的模型。问答模拟器使教育推荐系统(ERS)能够收集大量的训练数据，而无需与真实学生互动，从而防止训练不足的ERS做出的有害推荐破坏实际的学生学习。

Result: LDSim在模拟任务和知识追踪(KT)任务上都取得了很好的效果。

Conclusion: LDSim可以提高模拟性能，并且在模拟和知识追踪任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为近似最近邻注意力（ANNA）的有效注意力机制，它具有二次以下的时间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer具有模拟大规模并行计算（MPC）算法的表示能力，但它们受到二次时间复杂度的影响，这严重限制了它们的可扩展性。

Method: 我们引入了一种名为近似最近邻注意力（ANNA）的有效注意力机制。

Result: ANNA-transformer (1) 在匹配 MPC 算法的能力方面保留了先前为标准注意力建立的表达能力，并且 (2) 可以解决关键的推理任务，例如 Match2 和 $k$-hop，并具有接近最优的深度。使用 MPC 框架，我们进一步证明了恒定深度 ANNA-transformer 可以模拟恒定深度低秩 transformer，从而提供了一种统一的方式来推理各种有效的注意力近似。

Conclusion: ANNA 注意力机制是一种有效的注意力机制，它具有二次以下的时间复杂度，并且可以保留标准注意力的表达能力。

Abstract: Transformers have the representational capacity to simulate Massively
Parallel Computation (MPC) algorithms, but they suffer from quadratic time
complexity, which severely limits their scalability. We introduce an efficient
attention mechanism called Approximate Nearest Neighbor Attention (ANNA) with
sub-quadratic time complexity. We prove that ANNA-transformers (1) retain the
expressive power previously established for standard attention in terms of
matching the capabilities of MPC algorithms, and (2) can solve key reasoning
tasks such as Match2 and $k$-hop with near-optimal depth. Using the MPC
framework, we further prove that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate
constant-depth low-rank transformers, thereby providing a unified way to reason
about a broad class of efficient attention approximations.

Motivation: 在网络安全和金融等领域，异常检测至关重要，尤其是在处理大规模表格数据时。然而，无监督异常检测仍然是一个巨大的挑战。各种深度学习方法被提出用于建模数据集的联合分布，但现实世界的表格数据通常包含异构上下文，使得全局稀有事件在某些上下文中变得正常。因此，依赖单一的全局分布会忽略这些上下文细微差别，从而降低检测性能。

Method: 本文提出了一种上下文条件异常检测框架，该框架可以自动识别上下文特征，并使用简单的深度自动编码器对条件数据分布进行建模。

Result: 在多个表格基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于最先进的方法，强调了上下文在准确区分异常实例和正常实例方面的重要性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的上下文条件异常检测框架在表格数据异常检测方面表现出色，证明了考虑上下文信息的重要性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动天气模型性能达到瓶颈。

Method: 使用基于视觉Transformer的门控网络，动态学习每个网格点上多个“专家”模型的权重贡献，并以预测提前期为条件。

Result: MoWE模型在均方根误差(RMSE)方面优于任何单独的组件，在2天预测范围内，RMSE比性能最佳的AI天气模型低10%。

Conclusion: MoWE是一种计算效率高且可扩展的策略，通过充分利用高质量的预测模型，推动数据驱动天气预测技术的发展。

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

TL;DR: STRIDE: A scalable XAI framework using functional decomposition in RKHS, avoiding subset enumeration for efficiency and expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations of existing XAI frameworks: exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and reduced expressiveness of scalar summaries.

Method: Framing explanation as subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition in RKHS. Computing functional components via analytical projection based on recursive kernel-centering.

Result: Speedups ranging from 0.6x to 9.7x compared to TreeSHAP on tabular benchmarks, with high fidelity (R^2 0.81-0.999) and rank agreement.

Conclusion: STRIDE complements scalar attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling diagnostics like component surgery.

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

Motivation: 在机器学习中，选择泛化能力强的模型仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。Rashomon效应指的是多个模型在给定的学习问题上表现相似的情况。本文旨在解决如何利用这些模型来提高泛化能力。

Method: 该方法通过根据模型的性能和解释对模型进行分组，构建最大化多样性同时保持预测准确性的集成。

Result: 在开放和专有的真实世界协同数据集中验证了该方法，在 Rashomon 比率较大的情况下，AUROC 提高了 0.20+。同时证明了该方法在各种实际应用中对企业的切实利益。

Conclusion: 证明了该方法的稳健性、实用性和有效性

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 研究了深度线性网络的黎曼几何，为学习过程的热力学描述奠定基础。

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a
foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main
tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

Result: 在各种任务和基准测试中，实验结果证明了 Sensitivity-LoRA 的稳健有效性、效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA 是一种有前景的参数高效微调方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统的机器学习和深度学习模型通常依赖于基于相关的学习，这通常无法区分真正的因果关系和虚假关联，从而限制了它们的鲁棒性、可解释性和泛化能力。

Method: 该方法集成了多元格兰杰因果关系 (MVGC) 和 PCMCI+，用于混合神经架构中的因果特征选择。利用 43 年（1979-2021 年）的北极海冰范围 (SIE) 数据和相关的海洋-大气变量（每日和每月分辨率），该方法识别出具有因果影响力的预测变量，优先考虑 SIE 动态的直接原因，减少不必要的特征，并提高计算效率。

Conclusion: 该框架广泛适用于其他动态、高维领域，提供了一种可扩展的方法，可提高因果信息预测建模的理论基础和实际性能。

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

Method: 该框架使用物理信息神经网络（PINN）来近似基于HJB的价值函数，并通过引入价值梯度迭代（VGI）模块来改进梯度保真度，从而确保价值与微分结构一致。

Result: 该方法在包括多智能体粒子环境（MPE）和多智能体MuJoCo在内的标准基准的连续时间变体上，始终优于现有的连续时间强化学习基线，并且可以扩展到复杂的多智能体动态。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的CT-MARL框架能够有效地解决复杂动态系统中多智能体强化学习问题。

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

Motivation: ISP之间建立对等互联关系的过程复杂耗时，自动化对等互联伙伴选择可以提高效率。

Method: 利用公开数据，评估了基于树、神经网络和Transformer的机器学习模型在预测对等互联关系方面的性能。

Result: 基于树的模型表现出最高的准确性和效率，XGBoost模型在预测对等互联伙伴方面达到了98%的准确率，并且对时间、空间和缺失数据的变化具有很强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法可以帮助ISP自动化对等互联伙伴选择过程，从而实现更高效和优化的互联网生态系统。

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

Motivation: 现有的语音检测器主要针对英语和汉语，缺乏对西班牙语的支持，而西班牙语是全球超过6亿人使用的语言，因此需要专门的西班牙语语音取证数据集。

Method: 构建了包含六种口音的真实西班牙语语音和六种零样本TTS系统生成的合成语音的数据集HISPASpoof，并评估了五种代表性方法在该数据集上的检测和归因性能。

Conclusion: HISPASpoof为推进可靠和包容的西班牙语语音取证提供了一个关键的基准。

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

### [169] [Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177)
*Hanyi Mao,Quanjia Xiao,Lei Pang,Haixiao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了FSPO，一种序列级别的强化学习方法，通过在重要性采样权重空间中强制执行长度公平的裁剪来优化大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PPO/GRPO式裁剪方法在应用于序列时，会系统性地对短回复与长回复进行不同权重的调整，从而扭曲了有效目标。

Method: 提出了FSPO，使用基于高斯的修正方法，通过KL校正漂移项和缩放因子$\sqrt{L}$来裁剪序列log-IS比率。

Result: FSPO在不同长度的bins中降低了裁剪率，稳定了训练过程，并在多个评估数据集上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: FSPO通过直接在重要性采样权重空间中执行长度公平的裁剪，有效地解决了序列级别强化学习中的长度偏差问题，并在实验中取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

### [170] [Breaking the Statistical Similarity Trap in Extreme Convection Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09195)
*Md Tanveer Hossain Munim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DART模型，用于解决天气模型中常见的“统计相似性陷阱”问题，该陷阱导致模型在预测中过于模糊，无法有效识别极端天气事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习天气模型评估指标存在缺陷，导致模型倾向于产生模糊的预测，而忽略了罕见但影响重大的极端天气事件。

Method: DART采用双解码器架构，显式地进行背景/极端分解，并使用物理驱动的过采样和特定任务的损失函数，将粗糙的大气预报转化为高分辨率的卫星亮度温度场。

Result: DART在极端对流检测方面表现出色，CSI值达到0.273，偏差为2.52，优于基线模型。此外，研究还发现移除综合水汽输送（IVT）可以显著提高极端对流检测效果。

Conclusion: DART框架能够实现精确的操作校准，训练速度快，并且可以与现有的气象工作流程无缝集成，为可信赖的极端天气预警AI提供了一条途径。

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

*Somnath Hazra,Pallab Dasgupta,Soumyajit Dey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为增量惩罚近端策略优化 (IP3O) 的新算法，以解决连续控制环境中约束强化学习 (RL) 中的奖励最大化和约束满足之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在连续控制的约束强化学习 (RL) 中，策略优化方法在约束边界附近通常表现出不稳定性，导致次优训练性能，因此需要在奖励最大化和约束满足之间取得平衡。

Method: 该方法集成了一种自适应激励机制，以在接近约束边界之前保持在约束范围内，并提出了 IP3O 算法，该算法实施逐渐增加的惩罚以稳定训练动态。

Result: 在基准环境中的经验评估表明，与最先进的安全 RL 算法相比，IP3O 的有效性得到了证明。

Conclusion: 本文通过推导算法所实现的最佳状态的最坏情况误差的界限，提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

*Alka Gadakh,Vidya Kumbhar,Sonal Khosla,Kumar Karunendra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究旨在探讨农业旅游增长的策略，通过文献回顾和机器学习技术识别关键指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业旅游作为一种战略经济模式，可以通过多样化当地社区（如农民）的收入来源，同时促进土著文化遗产和传统农业实践的保护，从而促进农村发展。因此，有必要深入研究农业旅游增长的策略。

Method: 该研究分两个阶段进行：第一阶段通过全面的文献回顾识别重要指标；第二阶段使用最先进的技术来识别农业旅游增长的重要指标。应用了机器学习特征选择模型，观察到最小绝对收缩和选择算子（LASSO）方法与机器学习分类器（如逻辑回归（LR）、决策树（DT）、随机森林（RF）树和极端梯度提升（XGBOOST）模型）相结合，可用于预测农业旅游的增长。

Result: 结果表明，在使用LASSO方法时，LR模型在70-30%的训练-测试数据中给出了最高的分类精度，为98%，其次是RF，精度为95%。同样，在80-20%的训练-测试数据中，LR保持了最高的精度，为99%，而DT和XGBoost的精度紧随其后，为97%。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地识别了农业旅游增长的关键指标，并验证了LASSO方法与LR模型结合使用的有效性，为农业旅游的发展提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate
rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like
farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and
traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in
detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the
growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine
Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and
XGBoost follow with 97% accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vejde是一个结合数据抽象、图神经网络和强化学习的框架，用于解决具有丰富结构状态的决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有丰富结构状态的决策问题，例如对象类和关系。

Method: 使用数据抽象将MDP状态表示为实体事实数据库，并将每个状态转换为二分图，通过神经消息传递映射到潜在状态。使用监督学习和强化学习训练策略。

Result: Vejde策略在未见过的测试实例中泛化良好，分数没有显著损失，并且接近于特定实例的MLP代理。

Conclusion: Vejde可以在具有不同大小和结构的问题中推广策略。

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

*Hanyang Wang,Yuxuan Yang,Hongjun Wang,Lihui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于小样本无监督旋转机械故障诊断的多注意力元Transformer方法(MMT-FD)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转机械设备智能故障诊断通常需要大量的标记样本数据，但在实际工业应用中，获取足够的数据在时间和成本方面都具有挑战性。此外，不同类型的旋转机械设备具有不同的独特机械性能，需要对每种情况分别训练诊断模型。

Method: 该框架集成了时频域编码器和元学习泛化模型。时频域编码器预测通过时频域中的随机增强生成的状态表示。然后将这些增强的数据输入到元学习网络中进行分类和泛化训练，然后使用少量的标记数据进行微调。使用少量的对比学习迭代来迭代优化模型，从而实现高效率。

Result: 在轴承故障数据集和转子试验台数据上进行了实验。结果表明，MMT-FD模型仅使用1%的标记样本数据即可实现99%的故障诊断准确率，表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MMT-FD模型在小样本无监督旋转机械故障诊断中表现出强大的泛化能力和高效率。

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

*Jiawei Wang,Jiacai Liu,Yuqian Fu,Yingru Li,Xintao Wang,Yuan Lin,Yu Yue,Lin Zhang,Yang Wang,Ke Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG) 的框架，用于解决大型语言模型 (LLM) 在长程任务中由于稀疏奖励而难以进行信用分配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在长程任务中面临一个重大挑战：稀疏的、基于结果的奖励使得难以将信用分配给中间步骤。之前的研究主要集中于创建密集奖励信号来指导学习。

Method: 提出了 Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG)，该框架基于逐步不确定性和最终任务结果重新校准学习信号。EMPG 放大对自信的正确行为的更新，惩罚自信的错误，并减弱来自不确定步骤的更新以稳定探索。此外，还引入了一个针对未来清晰度的奖励项，鼓励智能体找到更可预测的解决方案路径。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的智能体任务 WebShop、ALFWorld 和 Deep Search 上的综合实验表明，EMPG 实现了显著的性能提升，并显著优于强大的策略梯度基线。

Conclusion: EMPG 是一种有效的框架，可以提高大型语言模型在长程任务中的学习效率和性能。

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在没有先验知识的情况下，对反应扩散系统进行系统识别是一个挑战。

Method: 使用数据驱动的规则集（DRSALife）模型学习软人工生命规则集，以准确表示反应扩散系统中的涌现动力学。

Result: 学习的模型能够以良好的准确率（74%）预测涌现动力学，并且在受到高斯噪声和时间稀疏性影响时表现出相当稳健的性能。成功识别了代表这些动力学的偏微分方程（PDE）的结构和参数。

Conclusion: 该研究探索了基于机器的软人工生命规则学习和反应扩散动力学系统识别，无需任何底层物理学的先验知识。

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

*Junda Ye,Zhongbao Zhang,Li Sun,Siqiang Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的子图专家混合 (MoSE) 框架，用于灵活和富有表现力的基于子图的表示学习，适用于不同的图任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络 (GNN) 在从图结构化数据中学习方面取得了巨大成功，但它们依赖于局部、成对的消息传递，限制了它们捕获复杂、高阶子图模式的能力，导致结构表达性不足。最近的努力试图通过将随机游走核集成到 GNN 中来增强结构表达性。然而，这些方法本质上是为图级任务设计的，这限制了它们对其他下游任务（如节点分类）的适用性。此外，它们固定的内核配置阻碍了模型在捕获各种子图结构方面的灵活性。

Method: MoSE 通过匿名游走提取信息丰富的子图，并根据结构语义将它们动态路由到专门的专家，从而使模型能够捕获具有改进的灵活性和可解释性的各种子图模式。

Result: 大量的实验以及学习到的子图专家的可视化表明，MoSE 不仅优于有竞争力的基线，而且还提供了对模型学习到的结构模式的可解释的见解。

Conclusion: 本文对 MoSE 在子图 Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) 测试中的表达性进行了理论分析，证明它比 SWL 更强大。

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

*Luca Giuliani,Michele Lombardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的计算HGR相关系数的方法，该方法基于用户可配置的多项式核，与先前的方法相比，具有更强的鲁棒性，并且具有更快但几乎同样有效的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HGR相关系数是Pearson相关系数的扩展，它不限于线性相关，在算法公平性、科学分析和因果发现方面具有潜在的应用。最近，人们提出了新的算法来以可区分的方式估计HGR，以方便其在约束机器学习应用中用作损失正则化器。然而，HGR的固有不可计算性需要偏差-方差的权衡，这可能会损害所提出方法的鲁棒性，因此如果在实际场景中应用，会引发技术问题。

Method: 我们引入了一种新的HGR计算方法，该方法依赖于用户可配置的多项式核。

Result: 我们的方法在鲁棒性和确定性方面提供了显著的优势，使其成为实际应用中更可靠的选择。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一个简短的实验分析，以验证我们的方法在约束机器学习框架中的适用性，表明它的计算产生了一个有见地的次梯度，可以作为损失正则化器。

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaLLMiX是一个零样本超参数优化框架，它结合了元学习、可解释AI和高效的LLM推理，无需额外试验即可推荐最佳超参数和预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中有效的模型和超参数选择仍然是一个主要的挑战，通常需要广泛的专业知识和计算。虽然AutoML和大型语言模型（LLM）承诺自动化，但目前基于LLM的方法依赖于试错和昂贵的API，这提供了有限的可解释性和泛化性。

Method: 通过利用具有SHAP解释的历史实验结果，MetaLLMiX可以推荐最佳超参数和预训练模型，而无需额外的试验。我们进一步采用LLM作为判断评估来控制输出格式、准确性和完整性。

Result: 在八个医学图像数据集上使用九个开源轻量级LLM的实验表明，MetaLLMiX实现了与传统HPO方法相当或更优越的性能，同时大大降低了计算成本。我们的本地部署优于之前的基于API的方法，在8个任务中的5个上实现了最佳结果，响应时间减少了99.6-99.9%，并且在6个数据集上实现了最快的训练时间（快2.4-15.7倍），同时保持了在最佳性能基线1-5%的精度。

Conclusion: MetaLLMiX在超参数优化方面表现出色，降低了计算成本，并提高了效率。

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in
deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While
AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based
approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited
interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot
hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI,
and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with
SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation
to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8
tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times
on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of
best-performing baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(LLM)生成的反事实解释(SCEs)可能不可靠，无法有效解释模型决策，甚至可能产生误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否能以自然语言解释其决策，特别是通过生成反事实解释(SCEs)来解释其预测，即修改输入以改变预测结果。

Method: 评估LLM生成SCEs的有效性和最小性，即SCEs是否能达到预期结果，并且修改输入的程度是否最小。

Result: LLM通常生成有效的SCEs，但不够精简，无法深入了解其决策行为。当要求生成最小化的反事实时，LLM通常会进行过小的修改，从而无法改变预测。有效性和最小性之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: SCEs作为一种可解释性工具效果不佳，甚至可能对模型行为产生误导。在高风险环境中使用LLM时，必须考虑不可靠的自我解释对下游决策的影响。

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

Motivation: 机器学习和地统计学是两种用于预测和空间mapping土壤性质的根本不同的框架。地统计学利用土壤性质的空间结构，而机器学习则捕捉可用环境特征和土壤性质之间的关系。

Method: 通过从普通克里金法中设计“空间滞后”特征，提出了一个混合框架，该框架通过空间背景丰富了ML。

Result: 与几种其他空间技术以及已建立的非空间机器学习算法相比，带有TabPFN的KpR证明了可靠的不确定性估计和更准确的预测。最值得注意的是，与没有空间背景的机器学习算法相比，它显着提高了约30％的平均R2。

Conclusion: 带有TabPFN的KpR是用于精密农业中数字土壤mapping的非常强大且通用的建模框架。

for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

*Daniel Agyapong,Briana H. Beatty,Peter G. Kennedy,Toby D. Hocking*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的微生物群落网络推断算法fuser，该算法能够有效处理不同环境下的微生物群落动态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法通常只关注单一环境下的微生物群落关联，忽略了微生物群落在不同生态条件下如何调整其关联。本文旨在研究微生物群落的空间和时间动态性。

Method: 本文提出了Same-All Cross-validation (SAC)框架，并开发了一种新的算法fuser。该算法在训练过程中保留子样本特异性信号，同时共享跨环境的相关信息，生成不同的、特定于环境的预测网络。

Result: 实验结果表明，在同质环境(Same)中，fuser的预测性能与现有算法glmnet相当。在跨环境(All)场景中，fuser显著降低了测试误差。

Conclusion: fuser算法能够有效提高微生物群落网络推断在不同环境下的预测性能，更好地理解微生物群落的动态变化。

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可控的分子图生成模型CSGD，通过concrete scores实现离散图的score matching，从而灵活控制条件引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图扩散模型在多条件控制下效果有限，依赖联合条件或连续松弛降低了保真度。

Method: 提出了Composable Score-based Graph Diffusion model (CSGD)，以及两种基于score的技术：Composable Guidance (CoG) 和 Probability Calibration (PC)。

Result: 在四个分子数据集上取得了state-of-the-art的性能，可控性比现有方法平均提高了15.3%，同时保持了较高的有效性和分布保真度。

Conclusion: 基于score的建模在离散图生成方面具有实际优势，并且能够灵活地进行多属性分子设计。

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

Motivation: 传统预测方法难以捕捉内生变量和外生因素之间的复杂依赖关系，为了解决这一难题。

Method: 该模型通过嵌入层融合外生输入，无需预测外生变量，并能有效关注其短期影响。模型重点预测内生变量，同时捕获所有输入变量之间的相互依赖关系和时间依赖性。

Result: 在 LausanneCity 数据集上，AquaCast 在仅使用内生变量时就表现出最好的性能。加入外生变量和预测报告后，性能进一步提升。在三个大型合成数据集上的测试结果表明，该模型始终优于现有基线，并在真实和合成数据集上保持稳健和准确的预测。

Conclusion: AquaCast 模型能够有效预测城市水动力学，并在不同数据集上表现出良好的泛化性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and
synthetic datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的优化器D2P2-SGD，它结合了动态差分隐私和随机投影，以在保持隐私的同时提高模型学习的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型参数和梯度信息容易泄露隐私，DPSGD的静态噪声机制影响模型性能的误差范围，且模型参数的指数增长使得使用随机优化器进行有效学习更具挑战性。

Method: 结合了动态差分隐私（DDP）与自动梯度裁剪和随机投影与SGD。

Result: 在不同数据集上的大量实验表明，D2P2-SGD显著提高了准确性，同时保持了隐私。

Conclusion: DDP以隐私为代价实现了更好的效用，而随机投影能够实现更高效的模型学习。

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated
to support the meta-learning community further. The data, code, supplementary

Result: 实验结果表明，少样本学习模型可以达到有竞争力的准确率。在多分类中，每个类别仅使用15个支持样本的情况下，模型达到了74.87%的准确率，而二元分类在所有类别对中都超过了70%的准确率。统计测试表明，二元和多类模型之间没有显著的性能差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在医疗诊断中应用少样本学习的可行性，尤其是在大型标记数据集不可用的情况下。

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning for
respiratory sound classification, focusing on coughbased detection of COVID-19,
Flu, and healthy conditions. We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram
representations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled
data. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to
achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class
models can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental
findings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.
Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,
particularly when large labeled datasets are unavailable.

Result: ProDiGy在各种场景中优于现有的防御方法。尤其是在客户端数据不遵循独立同分布的情况下，ProDiGy保持强大的防御能力和模型精度。

Conclusion: 双重视角方法可以促进诚实客户端之间的自然相似性，同时检测可疑的均匀性，以此作为攻击的潜在指标，是有效的。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed
learning. Despite its many advantages, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, especially under data heterogeneity. We propose a new Byzantine-robust
FL algorithm called ProDiGy. The key novelty lies in evaluating the client
gradients using a joint dual scoring system based on the gradients' proximity
and dissimilarity. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that
ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when
the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图对齐框架，该框架同时增强节点区分性并加强潜在空间中的几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法由于GNN的过度平滑导致节点区分性降低，并且由于结构噪声、特征异构性和训练不稳定导致潜在空间错位，从而导致节点对应关系不可靠。

Method: 引入了一个双通道编码器，结合了低通和高通频谱滤波器，以生成具有结构感知和高度区分性的嵌入。为了解决潜在空间错位问题，我们引入了一个几何感知函数映射模块，该模块学习图嵌入之间的双射和等距变换，确保不同表示之间的一致几何关系。

Result: 在图基准测试中，该方法始终优于现有的无监督对齐基线，对结构不一致性和具有挑战性的对齐场景表现出卓越的鲁棒性。此外，使用各种预训练模型对视觉语言基准进行全面评估表明，我们的框架可以有效地推广到图领域之外，从而实现视觉和语言表示的无监督对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架在图对齐和视觉语言对齐方面都表现出色，具有很强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic
spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the
underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

Conclusion: ReBaNO算法在解决偏微分方程问题上具有显著优势，尤其是在泛化能力和离散化不变性方面。

Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis

Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a
mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline
adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific
activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring
minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to
state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO,

them in terms of eliminating/shrinking the generalization gap for both in- and
out-of-distribution tests and being the only operator learning algorithm

*Bingxin Xu,Zhen Dong,Oussama Elachqar,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ButterflyQuant, a novel quantization method for large language models that uses learnable butterfly transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, achieving better performance than previous methods like QuaRot, especially in 2-bit quantization scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the memory footprint of large language models for deployment on consumer hardware. Extreme quantization leads to performance loss due to outliers in activations, and existing rotation-based methods use fixed transforms that don't adapt to specific weight distributions.

Method: The paper proposes ButterflyQuant, which replaces fixed Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. It also introduces a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations.

Result: On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

Conclusion: ButterflyQuant achieves better performance than existing methods by using learnable butterfly transforms and uniformity regularization, while maintaining orthogonality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过分析基于群体的反事实解释(GCEs)的时间演变来解释概念漂移。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态环境中，机器学习模型经常受到概念漂移的影响，其中数据分布的变化会降低性能。虽然检测这种漂移是一个经过充分研究的主题，但解释模型决策逻辑如何以及为什么发生变化仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 该方法跟踪漂移前后GCEs聚类中心及其相关的反事实行为向量的变化。这些不断变化的GCEs充当可解释的代理，揭示模型决策边界及其底层原理的结构变化。在三层框架中实施该分析，该框架协同结合来自数据层（分布变化）、模型层（预测不一致）和所提出的解释层的见解。

Result: 这种整体视图可以更全面地诊断漂移，从而可以区分不同的根本原因，例如空间数据漂移与概念的重新标记。

Conclusion: 通过分析GCEs的时间演变，可以有效地解释概念漂移，并区分不同的根本原因。

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

Conclusion: 这项工作朝着开发用于分子发现的高性能、化学可解释的深度学习模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FG-FARL的离线RL程序，用于校准每组安全阈值，以减少危害，同时平衡各个受保护亚组之间的公平性目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗补助人群健康管理项目中，旨在减少危害并提高决策支持的公平性。

Method: 使用来自医疗补助人群健康管理项目的去识别纵向轨迹，将FG-FARL与行为克隆（BC）和HACO（混合自适应共形离线RL）进行评估。

Result: FG-FARL在提高公平性指标的同时，实现了与基线相当的价值。

Conclusion: FG-FARL为更安全、更公平的决策支持提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: We introduce Feasibility-Guided Fair Adaptive Reinforcement Learning
(FG-FARL), an offline RL procedure that calibrates per-group safety thresholds
to reduce harm while equalizing a chosen fairness target (coverage or harm)
across protected subgroups. Using de-identified longitudinal trajectories from
a Medicaid population health management program, we evaluate FG-FARL against
behavior cloning (BC) and HACO (Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline RL; a global
conformal safety baseline). We report off-policy value estimates with bootstrap
95% confidence intervals and subgroup disparity analyses with p-values. FG-FARL
achieves comparable value to baselines while improving fairness metrics,
demonstrating a practical path to safer and more equitable decision support.
