However, a persistent and\nsubstantial gap remains between algorithm design and hardware implementation.\nBridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and\ntime-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between\nhigh-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages\n(HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing\nmanners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose\nA2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large\nlanguage models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable\nalgorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework\nthat enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common\nhallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension,\nA2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks,\nsimplifying code generation and improving consistency.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

Leveraging the best-performing model (Gemini 2.0 Flash), LLM judge,\nand human-in-the-loop feedback, we construct high-quality ground truth\ndatasets, which we use to fine-tune the open-source Zephyr model. Our results\ndemonstrate significant improvements in explanation quality after fine-tuning,\nwith particularly strong gains in the domain-specific dataset. Additionally, we\nintegrate a type inference module to support KGs lacking explicit type\ninformation.

However, existing feature interaction\nstrategies face two critical challenges in industrial applications: (1) The\nvast number of categorical and sequential features makes exhaustive interaction\ncomputationally prohibitive, often resulting in optimization difficulties. (2)\nReal-world recommender systems typically involve multiple prediction\nobjectives, yet most current approaches apply feature interaction modules prior\nto the multi-task learning layers. This late-fusion design overlooks\ntask-specific feature dependencies and inherently limits the capacity of\nmulti-task modeling. To address these limitations, we propose the Information\nFlow Network (INFNet), a task-aware architecture designed for large-scale\nrecommendation scenarios. INFNet distinguishes features into three token types,\ncategorical tokens, sequence tokens, and task tokens, and introduces a novel\ndual-flow design comprising heterogeneous and homogeneous alternating\ninformation blocks. For heterogeneous information flow, we employ a\ncross-attention mechanism with proxy that facilitates efficient cross-modal\ntoken interaction with balanced computational cost.

Effective fashion recommendation systems are crucial for\nfiltering irrelevant items and suggesting suitable ones. However,\nsimultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations\nremains a significant challenge, as these aspects are often treated\nindependently in existing studies, often overlooking the complex interactions\nbetween items and user preferences. This research introduces a new framework\nnamed FGAT, inspired by the HFGN model, which leverages graph neural networks\nand graph attention mechanisms to tackle this issue. The proposed framework\nconstructs a three-tier hierarchical graph of users, outfits, and items,\nintegrating visual and textual features to simultaneously model outfit\ncompatibility and user preferences. A graph attention mechanism dynamically\nweights node importance during representation propagation, enabling the capture\nof key interactions and generating precise representations for both user\npreferences and outfit compatibility. Evaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT\noutperforms baseline models such as HFGN, achieving improved results in\nprecision, HR, recall, NDCG, and accuracy.These results demonstrate that\ncombining multimodal visual-textual features with a hierarchical graph\nstructure and attention mechanisms significantly enhances the accuracy and\nefficiency of personalized fashion recommendation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFGAT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u5c1a\u642d\u914d\u63a8\u8350\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u5c1a\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u79cd\u7c7b\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7528\u6237\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u627e\u5230\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5546\u54c1\u53d8\u5f97\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u670d\u88c5\u642d\u914d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u7684\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u7269\u54c1\u548c\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u4e4b\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFGAT\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53d7\u5230HFGN\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728POG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cFGAT\u4f18\u4e8eHFGN\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001HR\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001NDCG\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "FGAT\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65f6\u5c1a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this\nfield, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)\nlack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for\nsufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a\ntrajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.\nTrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation\nNetwork (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data\npreprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports\nbroadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to\nlearn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet\nlearns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual\nfeatures with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive\nloss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an\nunsupervised manner.

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs)\nto generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns\nacross large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to\ncapture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their\ndiagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of\npersonalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors\nbased on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past\nquestion-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that\neffectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task\nis challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which\noften lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based\ngroup-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free\ntwo-stage framework.

Many existing methods treat posts independently\nand fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time\nand modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for\nrobustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into\npseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then\nprocesses each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual\nfeatures are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via\nintra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal\nattention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form\ncontextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal\nevolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a\ntrend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode\nnarrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event\nlevel, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To\naddress class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates\nadaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example\nmining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments\non Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this\nlimitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum,\nespecially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent\nhigh-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that\nintegrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information\nmaximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image\nquality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally\ninformative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we\nidentify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\\pm$27 nm) and\nreconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB.\nQuantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual\nseparability of VRU from the background.

While early research focused on unconditional sampling,\npractitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise\nspecification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants\nprecise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases\nlatency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and\ndenoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce\nEVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead\nwithout retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual\ncaching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we\nfirst profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained\ncontrol, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A\nlocality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the\ncontrol signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.\nFor temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to\nimprove efficiency.

However, due to the parameter explosion and data\nsparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order\nfeature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the\noccurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose\na novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning\ndistributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in\nword embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional\nrepresentations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different\nfeatures through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which\nthen serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new\ntest samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence\nBayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,\nNeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn\ndistributional representations of feature values and parameterize the\nconditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic\ngradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model\nefficiently.

This study investigates how eight LLMs (Claude Sonnet, Copilot, Gemini\nPro, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Llama, Mixtral, and Perplexity) reply to twenty\npragmatic questions about depression, anxiety, and stress when those questions\nare framed for six user profiles (baseline, woman, man, young, old, and\nuniversity student). The models generated 2,880 answers, which we scored for\nsentiment and emotions using state-of-the-art tools. Our analysis revealed that\noptimism, fear, and sadness dominated the emotional landscape across all\noutputs, with neutral sentiment maintaining consistently high values.\nGratitude, joy, and trust appeared at moderate levels, while emotions such as\nanger, disgust, and love were rarely expressed. The choice of LLM significantly\ninfluenced emotional expression patterns. Mixtral exhibited the highest levels\nof negative emotions including disapproval, annoyance, and sadness, while Llama\ndemonstrated the most optimistic and joyful responses. The type of mental\nhealth condition dramatically shaped emotional responses: anxiety prompts\nelicited extraordinarily high fear scores (0.974), depression prompts generated\nelevated sadness (0.686) and the highest negative sentiment, while\nstress-related queries produced the most optimistic responses (0.755) with\nelevated joy and trust.

This potential has\nbeen partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various\nfine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned\nvariants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data\nthat often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional\nshifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range\nof medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a\ntraining-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both\ngeneralist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical\nimage segmentation.

This creates an opportunity to empirically define\nbody composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using\nlarge-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal\npatterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full\ncohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese\n(n = 620) subgroups separately.

The key innovation\nof IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation\nmechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's\noutput to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability,\nand convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also\nintroduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first\ntwo-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the\ncritical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the\nQwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's\naccuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025\nGenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I.

However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and\ntransmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which\nlimits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection\n(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain\nadaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training\nparadigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse\ncaused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense\nobjects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain\nannotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision\nfoundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised\nframework for SFOD in remote sensing images.

Specifically, we\nintroduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's\nsemantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated\npseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from\nlow-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and\nquantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,\nwhich aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and\nimage levels.

Model reuse has been widely applied to reduce training\ncosts, but indiscriminately reusing entire models may incur significant\ninference overhead. Consequently, DNN modularization has gained attention,\nenabling module reuse by decomposing DNN models. The emerging\nmodularizing-while-training (MwT) paradigm, which incorporates modularization\ninto training, outperforms modularizing-after-training approaches. However,\nexisting MwT methods focus on small-scale CNN models at the convolutional\nkernel level and struggle with diverse DNNs and large-scale models,\nparticularly Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose\nNeMo, a scalable and generalizable MwT approach. NeMo operates at the neuron\nlevel fundamental component common to all DNNs-ensuring applicability to\nTransformers and various architectures. We design a contrastive learning-based\nmodular training method with an effective composite loss function, enabling\nscalability to large-scale models. Comprehensive experiments on two\nTransformer-based models and four CNN models across two classification datasets\ndemonstrate NeMo's superiority over state-of-the-art MwT methods.

Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and\npatch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly\nallocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in\nlow-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging\nwithout explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this\nwork, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video\ntokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We\nfirst extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a\nset of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian\nEmbedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D\nGaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,\nlower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information\ncontent during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding\nper-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a\nGaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into\nstatic and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across\ndifferent time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a\ncompact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,\nwhile also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression\nusing the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets.

In parallel,\nthe content features are aligned with image crop representations and\nconstrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation\nfor open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and\nsegmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D\nobject pose estimation.} Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/xiaomoguhz/DeCLIP", "AI": {"tldr": "DeCLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CLIP\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bc6\u96c6\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLMs)\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u7531\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7684\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6b20\u4f73\u3002CLIP\u7684\u56fe\u50cftokens\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u805a\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u5206\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DeCLIP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u201c\u5185\u5bb9\u201d\u548c\u201c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u201d\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "DeCLIP\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DeCLIP\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bc6\u96c6\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec2D\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u30013D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u548c6D\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant\nSpatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG\ndecoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism\nthat independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns,\nenabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while\nextracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized\nacross temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of\ndynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead.

Gradient-based DFL requires computing\nthe derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the\npredicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly.

However, existing methods struggle to align with\nfine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion\nnaturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the\ndifficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often\nconflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality\ndatasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we\nfirst introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns\nhuman-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy\nmultidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a\nlarge-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K\npreference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert\nPreference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based\nportrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO\ndecouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused\nacross timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained\nenhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments\ndemonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in\naligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial\nimprovements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and\nvisual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations.

Existing approaches that\nintegrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model\npatterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a\nnovel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy\nversus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable\nHarmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic\nWeighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically\nweighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an\nanalysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular\nlevels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the\nframework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the\ntransition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies\na token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert\ntokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from\noff-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks,\nproviding empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient\nlearning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with\non-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over\nbaselines.

However, existing methods for CBT learning\nsuch as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are\nhindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due\nto their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive\nfocus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the\ngenerated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory\nCOgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC)\nto learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD\n(Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow\nfor tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling\nthe modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By\nintegrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO\ncaptures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process\ninformation and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases:\n(1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional\nconnectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to\nthe best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity\nstudies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive\nreservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show\nthat our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms\nof centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory\nmemory retention.

However, achieving fine-grained age editing while\npreserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we\npropose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate\nage editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained\nage editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross\nattention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related\nfeatures. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age\nattributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial\naging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that\npredicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising\nimage reconstruction during training.

Gerken"], "title": "Finite-Width Neural Tangent Kernels from Feynman Diagrams", "comment": "11 pages + appendices", "summary": "Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) are a powerful tool for analyzing deep,\nnon-linear neural networks. In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be\ncomputed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the\ntraining dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training\nsuch as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite\nwidth effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian\nstatistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing\nfinite-width corrections to NTK statistics.

A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object\nmotion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in\nsimple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with\ninaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between\nobjects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing\ngeometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant\nobjects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address\nthis, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable\nspatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency\nTracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified\nspatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative\ntrajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our\ncue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature\nrepresentations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a\ndynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for\nstable online tracking.

To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful\ngenerative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable\nimage classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by\nrandomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising\neffects with different category conditions to classify categories.\nUnfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise\ninstability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance\nchanges. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always\nensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces\nthe classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in\nDC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the\ninstability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two\nprinciples: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,\nwe propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)\nnoise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a\ndataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly\ninitialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a\nMeta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise\noffset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to\nreplace random noise.

We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a\npreliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \\textit{a\npriori} testing.
