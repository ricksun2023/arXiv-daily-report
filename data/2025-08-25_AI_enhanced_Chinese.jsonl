Despite these advantages, many existing\npruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require\ncomputationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a\nnovel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained\nLLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages\nboth weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate\nredundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,\nand easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM\narchitectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of\nstandard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner\nsurpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight\nupdates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the\nhighest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the\ncorresponding codes publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/sazzadadib/Z-Pruner.", "AI": {"tldr": "Z-Pruner: A novel and efficient post-training pruning method for LLMs that doesn't require retraining and outperforms existing methods.", "motivation": "Large LLM sizes pose challenges for deployment, scalability, and energy efficiency.

In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are\ncomputed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,\neroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose\nTensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the\nlatent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs\nattention independently per shard, and then combines results with an\nall-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while\nunlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in\nTPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger\nrepresentational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained\nusing MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient\ntensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal\ntransforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further\nmitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By\nreducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x\nand 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while\nmaintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks.

Despite these advances,\nexisting methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw\nmodality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior\ngraph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and\nmodality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second,\nthey use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a\nfixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of\nmodality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA.\nFirst, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by\nincorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from\nrepresentations generated by a pretrained MMR model.

With the astounding\nadvances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been\ndeveloped to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the\npotential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently\nconstrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs\ntypically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input\nlayer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in\ndeeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual\nembeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer\nSteerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to\ndirectly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the\nprogressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF\nleverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically\nrich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across\nLLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are\ndesigned to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual\nmodalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures\nefficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven\nbenchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared\nwith baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE.

DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared\nPreprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users\nand items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user\npreferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain\nRating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across\ndomains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.\n  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates\ndomain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the\nnon-overlapping CDR setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "DUP-OT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5bf9\u9f50\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u504f\u597d\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u7528\u6237\u6216\u7269\u54c1\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "DUP-OT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5171\u4eab\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u7528\u6237GMM\u6743\u91cd\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8bc4\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDUP-OT\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "DUP-OT\u5728\u975e\u91cd\u53e0CDR\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

However,\nexisting approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented\nmulti-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior\nmethods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as\nrule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2)\nSuboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query\nreformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate\ngolden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing\nmethods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient\ninformation from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge.\nFundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between\nretrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the\nOrchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel\nreasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM)\ndecomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute\nModule (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective\nretrieval.

All\ndecisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,\nthe primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the\nprior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow\nUp Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with\ninterpretation on maturity thresholds.

This population drift renders stationary\nclassifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that\nembeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary\nlinear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant\nanalysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to\nhandle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)\nan expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system\nparameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that\nsimultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario\ncommon in practice.

This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for\ntask arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients\nof the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector\ngenerated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative\ngradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical\nmulti-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a\nsecond-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks.

However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict\nconsistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,\nwhich limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by\nconvolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection\naccuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a\nnovel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and\ndiffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,\nsubmanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure\ncomputational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth\nof the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)\ndiffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich\nspatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to\nstrengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features\nproduced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or\nSSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,\nhighlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several\nbenchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based\nmodels. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves\ndetection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7\nmAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP\non ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets.

The goal\nof prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high\ngeneration quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,\nface challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like\nmissing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token\nremoval. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.\n  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt\ncompression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method\ncenters at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method\nsplits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be\nmore concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We\ndesign several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized\nsemantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,\ncompression prioritization, and keyword maintaining.

In this paper, we\nidentify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based\ndiffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data\nspace. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate\nthat collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its\nunderlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low\nnoise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting\nin high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,\nultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing\ntechniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our\nexplanation of collapse errors.

Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have\nachieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to\ngreedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood\nproposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what\nextent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we\neffectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run.

Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local\nneighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as\npairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches\ncan mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of\nmanifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the\ncompactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to\nseparate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this\nresearch, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with\nTwo-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by\neffectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by\ndividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases.

To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.\nTo generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data\ngeneration pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements\n(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user\nqueries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and\nbrand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated\nevaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web\nagents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current\nagents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks.

Previous studies\nhave attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,\nthese approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose\nfundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this\npaper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed\nto protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based\ninpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to\nexploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we\nidentify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically\nuninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.\nThe injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus\naway from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the\neffect of prompt.

In\nfact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average\ncorrelation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles.

Despite\npromising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high\ncomputational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their\ndeployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight\napproaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable\nconvolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,\nthese methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack\neffective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully\nleverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose\nGMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction\nand interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)\nmodules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature\nextraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further\nintegrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a\nparameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to\nenhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational\noverhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that\nGMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU\nand 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.\nAdditional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further\nconfirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its\npotential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect\ndetection.

Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant\nlabels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes.

Given a query\nitem and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the\nbase regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance\nweighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,\nRankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using\nonly 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language\nmodel (LLM) with no finetuning.
