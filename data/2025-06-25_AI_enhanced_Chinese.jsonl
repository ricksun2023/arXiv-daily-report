Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine\ngrained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle\nattributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline\nwhere each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and\npassed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,\ncomposed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained\nspecifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under\nvaried conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.\nAdditionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time\nAPI that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to\nensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage\napproach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon\nemissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset\nenriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8\ndetector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for\nbounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy\nreached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the\nfeasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical\ndeployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for\nautomated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "Enhanced YOLOv8 framework uses deep OCR and real-time API for real-time vehicle detection, license plate recognition, and carbon emission estimation.", "motivation": "Estimating carbon emissions in urban environments requires precise vehicle detection, classification, and license plate recognition, which YOLOv8 alone cannot achieve with sufficient granularity.", "method": "The system enhances YOLOv8 with a hybrid pipeline, incorporating deep OCR and a real-time API to recognize license plates, classify vehicle types, and validate information against a vehicle registration database.", "result": "The YOLOv8 detector achieved a mAP@0.5 of 71% for bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks, while character-level OCR accuracy reached up to 99%.", "conclusion": "The enhanced YOLOv8 framework combines real-time object detection with deep OCR for accurate vehicle-specific carbon emission monitoring, demonstrating feasibility for deployment in smart transportation systems."}}

Prior work often conflates the\ncognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,\nleading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum\ngame inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds\nto a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from\nuntrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt\nstyles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament\ngameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to\nrandomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of\nprompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit\nhints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to\nexploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers.

To\nsupport dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated\nrouter at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to\nre-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than\nbeing statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing\nmechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the\nmodel's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under\nfixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to\n1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling\naxis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional\nwidth/depth scaling.

Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the\ngraph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To\nthis end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in\nmulti-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive\ncoarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the\ncoarsening results and efficiency.

It builds embedding\nrepresentations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample\npairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.\nWithout exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a\nfederated aggregation strategy.

Determining the most probable condition\namong overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical\nexpertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have\nsignificantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy\nconcerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs\nservices in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a\ntrustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using\nlow-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.\nOur approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential\ndiagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and\nvariable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The\ndeveloped web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured\nmedical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By\nincorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures\ntransparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.\nExtensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current\nstate-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility\nin clinical settings.

We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,\nutilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by\nintroducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to\nmisclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the\nLCDR to trip.

Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models\nperform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial\nattacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%.

KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and\ndiscovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine\nlearning, and recommendation systems.

Visual masks were created from gaze\npoints to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing\nirrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,\nwhile an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a\nclassifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human\ngaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional\nmethods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance\nbut also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills,\nparticularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results\nshow improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness,\nhighlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and\npatient outcomes in emergency medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "A machine learning system using human gaze data and video recordings improves the assessment of endotracheal intubation (ETI) skills, offering a more accurate and objective evaluation compared to traditional methods.", "motivation": "Current airway management skill assessments in emergency medicine rely on subjective evaluation, which often fails to gauge competency in real-world scenarios.", "method": "A machine learning system leverages an attention mechanism guided by human gaze and video recordings, using visual masks created from gaze points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas.

To determine the suitability of VLMs\nfor these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are\ncompared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization\nguidelines.\n  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze\ndiagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels\n(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score\n96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the\nimage quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among\nthe employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting\nstrategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.\n  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of\npotential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and\nunnecessary 3D effects.

As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is\nestimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This\napproach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to\nimproved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are\ninherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question\narises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting\nat the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk\nminimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term\novertuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical\nrelevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML\nliterature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it\nfrom related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale\nreanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of\novertuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously\nassumed, typically mild but occasionally severe.

Prior modular\npipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end\n(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by\nfixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce\n\\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system\nthat can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for\nfine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level\nlandmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a\nreversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains\nhistorical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory\n(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time\nobstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply\nprunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are\ndecoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings.

For the aforementioned challenges,\nwe propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which\nconsists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the\nTask-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,\nthe GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to\nextract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is\ntrained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,\neach of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing\nphase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the\nTSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the\ngeneralized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This\ndesign enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with\nsparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world\ndatasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings.

Their design involves a\nhigh-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive\nphysics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma\nphysics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more\naccessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by\nthe lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and\ndatasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic\n(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial\nfusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we\nrelease an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,\npaired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance\nmetrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and\noptimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three\noptimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective\ngeometric optimization problem, (2) a \"simple-to-build\" QI stellarator, and (3)\na multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs\nbetween compactness and coil simplicity.

Gradient integration is a building block in\nthe attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived\nsamples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a\nbuilding block often combines with other information from visual models such as\nactivation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the\nsample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image\ndistribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add\nnoise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low\nexplanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra\ninformation can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy\nattribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment\nproblem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a\nsemi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample\ndistribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the\ndistribution of natural images.
