Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究将大型语言模型集成到房产预订平台中，以提高住宿数据的一致性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线房产预订平台广泛使用，并且严重依赖关于住宿设施的最新信息，这些信息通常来自第三方提供商。然而，这些外部数据源经常受到不完整或不一致的细节的影响，这可能会让用户感到沮丧，并导致市场损失。

Method: 对使用 QLoRA 微调的 Mistral 7B 和使用改进的系统提示的 Mixtral 8x7B 进行了评估，基于它们生成一致和同类描述的能力，同时最大限度地减少幻觉。

Result: Mixtral 8x7B 在完整性、精确性和幻觉率方面优于 Mistral 7B，但计算成本更高：50GB VRAM 和 1.61 美元/小时，而 Mistral 7B 则为 5GB 和 0.16 美元/小时。

Conclusion: Mixtral 8x7B 在完整性（99.6% vs. 93%）、精确性（98.8% vs. 96%）和幻觉率（1.2% vs. 4%）方面优于 Mistral 7B，但计算成本显着更高。

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

TL;DR: ElectriQ是一个新的基准，旨在通过领域知识增强和微调，提高LLM在电力营销客户服务中的性能，实验表明小型模型可以优于大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的电力营销客户服务系统存在响应时间慢、程序不灵活以及领域特定任务的准确性有限等问题。大型语言模型（LLM）虽然表现出强大的通用能力，但缺乏该领域的专业知识和同理心。

Method: 引入ElectriQ，这是第一个旨在评估和增强电力营销场景中LLM的基准。

Result: 在13个LLM上的实验表明，经过微调和增强的小型模型，如LLama3-8B，在专业性和用户友好性方面可以超过GPT-4o。

Conclusion: ElectriQ建立了一个全面的基础，用于开发为电力营销服务定制的LLM。

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

TL;DR: detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse platforms


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting and categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online sources.

Method: a hierarchical classification framework that combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning strategy

Result: outperforms several baselines, including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird

Conclusion: The model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of 0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

### [4] [Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22917)
*Kwun Hang Lau,Ruiyuan Zhang,Weijie Shi,Xiaofang Zhou,Xiaojun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的RAG框架，通过注入时间逻辑来改进RAG处理时序问题的能力，并在ADQAB数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的、语义驱动的检索方法不具备为指定期限收集在主题相关且在时间上连贯的证据的能力。

Method: 该方法首先将用户的查询分解为核心主题和时间窗口，然后使用专门的检索器来校准语义匹配与时间相关性，确保收集到的连续证据集跨越整个查询周期。

Result: 在ADQAB上的实验结果表明，该方法在答案准确性方面优于标准RAG实现13%到27%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的RAG框架，通过将时间逻辑注入到RAG流程中，解决了RAG在处理需要跨时间跟踪实体和现象的纵向查询方面的不足。在ADQAB上的实验结果表明，该方法在答案准确性方面优于标准RAG实现13%到27%。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeQoDO利用LLM自动构建任务导向对话本体，提高了可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型依赖参数知识，缺乏可解释性和可信度。现有的面向任务对话系统依赖外部数据库和本体，但构建这些本体需要手动标注或监督训练。

Method: TeQoDO：一种文本到SQL的任务导向对话本体构建方法

Result: TeQoDO优于迁移学习方法，其构建的本体在下游对话状态跟踪任务中具有竞争力。对话理论在其中起着关键作用。TeQoDO可以扩展到构建更大的本体。

Conclusion: TeQoDO通过利用LLM的SQL编程能力和对话理论，无需监督即可自动构建TOD本体，并在下游对话状态跟踪任务中表现出色，尤其是在构建大型本体方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

### [6] [A Hybrid Framework for Subject Analysis: Integrating Embedding-Based Regression Models with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22913)
*Jinyu Liu,Xiaoying Song,Diana Zhang,Jason Thomale,Daqing He,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们提出了一个混合框架，该框架集成了基于嵌入的ML模型与LLM，以预测图书的主题词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主题分析在很大程度上尚未开发。传统机器学习的多标签分类在主题分析中得到了应用，但在处理未见过的情况时遇到了困难。LLM提供了一种替代方案，但经常过度生成和产生幻觉。

Method: 集成了基于嵌入的ML模型与LLM的混合框架

Result: 实验结果表明，提供初始预测以指导LLM生成并强制进行后期编辑可以产生更受控和符合词汇表的结果。

Conclusion: 引导LLM生成并进行后期编辑可以产生更受控和符合词汇表的结果。

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

*Lee Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from medical documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models are costly and produce hallucinations.

Method: Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm

Result: Combining a collection of language models in a multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding hallucinations.

Conclusion: The novel LMC algorithm significantly contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored much further in the future.

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

### [8] [Full Triple Matcher: Integrating all triple elements between heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22914)
*Victor Eiti Yamamoto,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel KG integration method using label and triple matching to improve entity-matching accuracy, achieving competitive results and introducing a new dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world KGs often vary significantly in source, size, and information density, which are not typically represented in current entity matching methods.

Method: The paper proposes a KG integration method consisting of label matching and triple matching, using string manipulation, fuzzy matching, and vector similarity techniques.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and against supervised methods.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a KG integration method with competitive performance compared to leading systems, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases. It also introduces a new dataset for evaluating the triple-matching step.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的输入嵌入方法，通过捕捉全局关系和多句推理，更准确地预测文档级别实体关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以前的方法只关注实体被提及的句子，无法捕捉到准确关系抽取所需的完整文档上下文。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新颖的输入嵌入方法，通过将实体表示为独立的片段来捕捉全局关系和多句推理，而不是仅仅关注实体出现的范围。

Result: 在DocRED、Re-DocRED和REBEL三个基准关系抽取数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能够准确预测文档级别设置中实体之间的关系。

Conclusion: 该方法在文档级别的关系抽取中准确地预测了实体之间的关系，并在理论和实践上都具有意义。

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

TL;DR: This paper provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including definitions, analyses, detection, mitigation, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts.

Method: This paper uses learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes and Rademacher complexity) to derive bounds on hallucination risk. It also surveys detection strategies and mitigation approaches.

Result: This paper distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations and defines a hallucination risk for models. It proposes a unified detection and mitigation workflow and outlines evaluation protocols for hallucination.

Conclusion: This paper lays a theoretical foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of hallucination in LLMs.

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MusT-RAG框架，通过检索增强生成(RAG)和音乐专业向量数据库MusWikiDB，提升大型语言模型在音乐问答任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)的最新进展已经在不同的领域展示了卓越的能力。虽然它们在各种任务上表现出强大的零样本性能，但由于其训练数据中特定于音乐的知识比例相对较小，llm在音乐相关应用中的有效性仍然有限。

Method: 提出了MusT-RAG，一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的综合框架，以使通用LLM适应于纯文本音乐问答(MQA)任务。为了优化RAG在音乐领域，(1)提出了MusWikiDB，一个用于检索阶段的音乐专业向量数据库，以及(2)在推理和微调过程中利用上下文信息，以有效地将通用LLM转换为音乐特定模型。

Result: MusT-RAG在增强LLM的音乐领域适应能力方面显著优于传统的微调方法，并在领域内和领域外MQA基准测试中显示出持续的改进。此外，MusWikiDB比通用的维基百科语料库更有效，提供了卓越的性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: MusT-RAG在增强LLM的音乐领域适应能力方面显著优于传统的微调方法，并在领域内和领域外MQA基准测试中显示出持续的改进。MusWikiDB比通用的维基百科语料库更有效，提供了卓越的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale still converge on comparable internal concepts.

Method: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, align the resulting monosemantic features via activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and RSA.

Result: Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar subspaces interact similarly with language models.

Conclusion: large language models carve the world into broadly similar, interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a foundation for cross-model interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多关系图和结构熵最小化的无监督多文档摘要框架MRGSEM-Sum。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常只考虑单关系图，并且需要预定义数量的集群，这阻碍了它们充分表示丰富的关系信息和自适应地划分句子组以减少冗余的能力。

Method: 该方法构建了一个多关系图，该图集成了句子之间的语义和语篇关系，综合建模了文档中句子之间错综复杂和动态的连接。然后，应用二维结构熵最小化算法进行聚类，自动确定最佳聚类数量，并将句子有效地组织成连贯的组。最后，引入了一种位置感知压缩机制来提炼每个聚类，生成简洁而信息丰富的摘要。

Result: MRGSEM-Sum在四个基准数据集上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明，该方法始终优于以往的无监督方法，在某些情况下，其性能可与有监督模型和大型语言模型相媲美。人工评估表明，MRGSEM-Sum生成的摘要具有很高的一致性和覆盖率，接近人工水平。

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

### [14] [A novel language model for predicting serious adverse event results in clinical trials from their prospective registrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22919)
*Qixuan Hu,Xumou Zhang,Jinman Kim,Florence Bourgeois,Adam G. Dunn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates methods for predicting serious adverse event (SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their registrations prior to the trial. The best model (ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a higher proportion of patients with SAEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants to unnecessary risks with accurate estimates of expected safety results.

Method: Two prediction models were developed: a classifier predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates than control arm, and a regression model to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms. A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g., ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was developed for embedding extraction.

Result: The best model (ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across 12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%.

Conclusion: Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported safety results.

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

TL;DR: This survey provides a structured taxonomy and analysis of discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs, focusing on vector quantization (VQ) techniques. It addresses the lack of comprehensive surveys in this area and bridges the gap between traditional VQ and modern LLM applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Despite its growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs.

Method: We categorize 8 representative VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM pipelines.

Result: identifying key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired codebook learning.

Conclusion: This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference

Motivation: explores whether sentiment derived from social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements

Result: social media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices

Conclusion: social media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends, exhibit stronger predictive signals

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

TL;DR: 本文系统地评估了不同提示翻译策略对多语言系统中 RAG 增强的 LLM 分类任务的影响，发现优化的提示策略可以显著提高跨语言的知识共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的多语言能力取得了进步，但它们在不同语言和任务中的表现差异很大。在多语言检索增强生成 (RAG) 系统中，知识库 (KB) 通常从高资源语言（如英语）共享到低资源语言，导致从 KB 检索到的信息与上下文的其余部分使用不同的语言。在这种情况下，两种常见的做法是预翻译以创建单语提示和跨语言提示以进行直接推理。然而，这些选择的影响仍不清楚。

Method: 系统地评估了不同提示翻译策略对多语言系统中 RAG 增强的 LLM 分类任务的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，优化的提示策略可以显著提高跨语言的知识共享，从而提高下游分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: 优化的提示策略可以显著提高跨语言的知识共享，从而提高下游分类任务的性能。研究结果提倡更广泛地利用多语言资源共享和非英语语言（尤其是低资源语言）的跨语言提示优化。

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在美国在线计算机课程中，母语与非母语英语使用者身份如何影响同伴反馈体验的三个指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在美国的研究生计算机科学项目中，越来越多的国际学生入学，其中2023年有60.2%的硕士学位授予了非美国学生。许多学生参加在线课程，在这些课程中，同伴反馈被用于吸引学生并以可扩展的方式改进教学。由于这些课程是用英语进行的，许多学生学习的语言不是他们的第一语言。

Method: 使用基于Twitter-roBERTa的模型，分析了500名学生的同伴评审的情绪。

Result: 母语为英语的人对反馈的评价较低，而非母语的人写的评价更积极，但收到的积极情绪较少。

Conclusion: 母语为英语的人对反馈的评价较低，而非母语的人写的评价更积极，但收到的积极情绪较少。当控制性别和年龄时，会出现显著的相互作用，这表明语言背景在塑造同伴反馈体验中起着适度但复杂的作用。

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical memory architecture (H-MEM) for LLM Agents that improves long-term dialogue performance by organizing and efficiently retrieving memories in a structured, multi-level fashion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory mechanisms for Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents) often fall short in structured memory organization and efficient retrieval.

Method: A Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer. During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient, layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.

Result: The proposed approach consistently outperforms five baseline methods on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture outperforms five baseline methods in long-term dialogue scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基准测试侧重于噪声鲁棒性等广泛方面，但缺乏对文档利用的系统和精细的评估框架。大多数基准测试侧重于整体RAG系统性能，很少评估LLM的具体能力。

Method: 该论文提出了一个创新的基于占位符的方法，以解耦LLM的参数知识和外部知识的贡献。同时，构建了一个多层次细粒度的基准测试Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark，强调以下递进维度：（1）多层次过滤能力，（2）组合能力，（3）参考推理。

Result: 实验证明了代表性LLM在RAG系统的生成能力方面的局限性，尤其是在误差弹性和上下文忠实性方面。

Conclusion: 这篇论文表明，具有代表性的LLM在RAG系统的生成能力方面存在局限性，尤其是在误差弹性和上下文忠实性方面。该基准测试提供了一个可复现的框架，用于开发更可靠和高效的RAG系统。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT提示可以提高大型语言模型在多步任务上的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Chain-of-thought (CoT) 提示提高了大型语言模型在多步任务上的准确性，但生成的“想法”是否反映了真实的内部推理过程仍未解决。

Method: 结合稀疏自动编码器与激活补丁，从Pythia-70M和Pythia-2.8B中提取单义特征，同时它们在CoT和plain (noCoT) 提示下处理GSM8K数学问题。

Result: 在2.8B模型中，将一小部分CoT推理特征换入noCoT运行中，显著提高了答案的对数概率，但在70M模型中没有可靠的效果，揭示了一个清晰的规模阈值。CoT还导致较大模型中更高的激活稀疏性和特征可解释性得分，表明更模块化的内部计算。例如，模型对生成正确答案的置信度从1.2提高到4.3。我们引入了补丁曲线和随机特征补丁基线，表明有用的CoT信息不仅存在于前K个补丁中，而且广泛分布。

Conclusion: CoT可以诱导高容量LLM中更易于解释的内部结构，验证了其作为结构化提示方法的角色。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

Motivation: 医学大型语言模型（MLLM）在眼科诊断中起着关键作用，但它们的准确性受到幻觉的限制，这些幻觉源于有限的眼科知识、不足的视觉定位和推理能力以及多模式眼科数据的稀缺，这些共同阻碍了精确的病灶检测和疾病诊断。此外，现有的医学基准未能有效评估各种类型的幻觉或提供可行的解决方案来缓解它们。

Method: 我们提出了一个以代理为中心的三阶段框架，包括知识水平检索阶段、任务水平案例研究阶段和结果水平验证阶段。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的多智能体框架显著减少了两种类型的幻觉，提高了准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该多智能体框架显著减少了幻觉的两种类型，提高了准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new synthetic dataset for PII detection in social media, addressing the lack of open-source labeled data and ensuring privacy through reproducibility, unlinkability, and indistinguishability metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research into the identification and retrieval of risky self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled datasets.

Method: The authors develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing data using text generation Large Language Models (LLMs) with sequential instruction prompting.

Result: The utility of the methodology is evaluated with three metrics: reproducibility equivalence, unlinkability to original users, and indistinguishability from the original data by trained humans.

Conclusion: The paper releases a new synthetic PII-labeled dataset and code to foster research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

Conclusion: ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing

ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information

Abstract: Hallucinations are often inevitable in downstream tasks using large language
models (LLMs). To tackle the substantial challenge of addressing hallucinations
for LLM-based ontology matching (OM) systems, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset OAEI-LLM-T. The dataset evolves from seven TBox datasets in the
Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), capturing hallucinations of
ten different LLMs performing OM tasks. These OM-specific hallucinations are
organised into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the
usefulness of the dataset in constructing an LLM leaderboard for OM tasks and
for fine-tuning LLMs used in OM tasks.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source
curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

Motivation: Systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored. Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial analysis

Method: We create a set of domain-specific prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and across-model similarity).

Result: GPT gives the most coherent, semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and less agreement.

Conclusion: GPT gives the most coherent, semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and Perplexity.

TL;DR: This paper proposes CoE-Ops, a collaboration-of-expert framework incorporating a general-purpose large language model task classifier to improve the performance of AIOps. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: constrained by domain-specific knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a specific task. combining multiple models can achieve more efficient results

Method: proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.) and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.).

Result: CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Conclusion: CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Method: 利用从视觉大型语言模型（VLM）获得流程图的图表示，并将其整合到基于文本的RAG系统中。

Result: 图表示与ground truth相比具有较低的编辑距离，这说明了这些表示对于流程图图像的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 使用图表示进行QA的方法在检索性能方面表现良好，并且减轻了推理中对VLM的需求。

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

*Rui Jiao,Yue Zhang,Jinku Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RELIANCE 框架通过事实检查、强化学习和可解释性分析，提高了大型语言模型推理的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 中存在一个严重漏洞：尽管最终答案正确，但在中间推理步骤中普遍存在事实不准确的情况。这种现象在高风险领域（包括医疗保健、法律分析和科学研究）中构成了重大风险，在这些领域中，错误但自信地呈现的推理可能会误导用户做出危险的决定。

Method: 该框架集成了三个核心组件：（1）一个专门的事实检查分类器，该分类器经过对反事实增强数据进行训练，以检测推理链中细微的事实不一致；（2）一种组相对策略优化 (GRPO) 强化学习方法，通过多维奖励来平衡事实性、连贯性和结构正确性；(3) 一个机械可解释性模块，用于检查事实性改进如何在推理过程中的模型激活中体现出来。

Result: 对 10 个最先进模型的广泛评估揭示了令人担忧的模式：即使是像 Claude-3.7 和 GPT-o1 这样的领先模型也分别只表现出 81.93% 和 82.57% 的推理事实准确率。

Conclusion: RELIANCE 显著提高了事实稳健性（高达 49.90% 的提升），同时保持或提高了在具有挑战性的基准测试（包括 Math-500、AIME-2024 和 GPQA）上的性能。此外，我们的激活水平分析提供了可操作的见解，了解事实增强如何重塑模型架构中的推理轨迹，为未来通过激活引导优化明确针对事实稳健性的训练方法奠定基础。

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

*Paul Minchella,Loïc Verlingue,Stéphane Chrétien,Rémi Vaucher,Guillaume Metzler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SigBERT is a temporal survival analysis framework that processes clinical reports to estimate patient-specific risk scores, achieving a C-index of 0.75 on an oncology dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form.

Method: SigBERT processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model to estimate patient-specific risk scores.

Result: The model was trained and evaluated on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort.

Conclusion: SigBERT integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing narrative-based survival analysis.

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the

efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated

TL;DR: NLP and adaptive sampling can speed up validation of code-based algorithms in claims databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: validating the measurement characteristics of code-based algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records.

Method: use of natural language processing (NLP) to reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and a multi-wave adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient precision.

Result: the NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by 40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision in derived measurement characteristics.

Conclusion: This approach could facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of find-ings derived from database studies.

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

TL;DR: 本文重新定义了任意性，认为它是一种构建人类系统和互动的基础功能机制，并提出了一个用于分析可解释性的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文认为，任意性不是一种规范缺陷或支配的症状，而是一种构建人类系统和互动的基础功能机制。与将任意性与不公正混为一谈的批判传统不同，它将任意性视为一种符号特征，使系统能够有效运作，同时保留其内在理由。

Method: 该论文基于索绪尔的符号任意性概念，并结合香农的熵模型，将任意性形式化为 A = H(L|M) (条件熵)。

Result: 该论文引入了“动机 -> 可证实性 -> 可争议性”链，认为动机是使行为逻辑容易受到主体间质疑的关键界面。通过“非动机化”或“冲突横向化”等机制打破这一链条时，行为会产生约束性效应，而不会暴露其理由，从而排除了可审判性。这种结构性不透明是一种保护权威免受问责的刻意设计。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的任意性理论，认为任意性是一种中性算子，对控制和人际关系至关重要，并为分析高级人工智能系统的可解释性提供了一条新途径。

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

TL;DR: SDMs lack comprehensive benchmarking compared to text-based LLMs. This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset and evaluation method to address the challenges of ambiguity and context-dependency in human voice interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: there exists a gap in research focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns. Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics.

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079

Result: LLMs 在 Math NLI 方面表现出积极和消极的结果。在某些设置中，使用 LLMs 的多数投票与使用人类标记的数据大致相当。LLMs 仍然难以理解数学语言，并且偶尔会在基本推理上失败。当前的模型不像上一代那样容易在我们的数据中进行仅假设的“推理”。

Conclusion: LLMs 在数学自然语言推理 (Math NLI) 方面表现出积极和消极的结果。在某些情况下，LLMs 的多数投票与人类标注的数据相当，但它们仍然难以理解数学语言，并且有时在基本推理上失败。该研究提供了用于未来 Math NLI 工作的语料库。

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用ICL和LLM来执行FSP的方法，无需模型微调，并在暴力事件相关框架子集上取得了有竞争力的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文研究了使用大型语言模型（LLM）的上下文学习（ICL）来执行FSP，而无需模型微调。

Method: 提出了一种自动生成特定任务提示的方法，用于框架识别（FI）和框架语义角色标注（FSRL）子任务，仅依赖于FrameNet数据库。

Result: 该方法取得了有竞争力的结果，FI的F1分数为94.3%，FSRL的F1分数为77.4%。

Conclusion: ICL为特定领域的FSP任务提供了一种实用且有效的替代传统微调的方法。

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

*Ali Veisi,Delaram Fartoot,Hamidreza Amirzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARoPE是一种新颖的位置编码方法，通过动态生成频率模式来改进RoPE，在效率和性能上都优于RoPE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE依赖于静态的、独立于输入的正弦频率模式，限制了其对上下文敏感关系进行建模的能力。

Method: 提出了一种CARoPE（上下文感知的旋转位置嵌入），它是RoPE的一种新的泛化，可以动态生成以token嵌入为条件的特定于头的频率模式。

Result: 实验结果表明，即使在较长的上下文长度下，CARoPE始终优于RoPE和其他常见的位置编码基线，实现了显著降低的困惑度。此外，CARoPE能够实现更快的训练吞吐量，而不会牺牲模型稳定性。

Conclusion: CARoPE在Transformer模型中为现有的位置编码策略提供了一个可扩展、富有表现力且高效的升级。

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

TL;DR: SMART-Editor 是一个用于组合布局和内容编辑的框架，它通过奖励引导的规划来保持全局连贯性，并在多个领域中优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型执行局部编辑，而 SMART-Editor 旨在通过保持全局连贯性来克服这一局限性。

Method: 该框架采用 Reward-Refine (一种推理时奖励引导的细化方法) 和 RewardDPO (一种使用奖励对齐布局对的训练时偏好优化方法) 两种策略。

Result: SMART-Editor 在 SMARTEdit-Bench 基准测试中优于 InstructPix2Pix 和 HIVE 等强大的基线模型，RewardDPO 在结构化设置中实现了高达 15% 的收益，而 Reward-Refine 在自然图像上显示出优势。

Conclusion: SMART-Editor 通过奖励引导的规划，在生成语义一致和视觉对齐的编辑方面表现出色。

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

*Jeffrey Eben,Aitzaz Ahmad,Stephen Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种可扩展的文本到SQL系统，该系统使用组件化检索架构，该架构优于大型数据库的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的数据库自然语言接口取得了进展，但扩展到企业级数据目录仍然是一个尚未充分探索的挑战。先前解决这一挑战的著作依赖于特定领域的微调（使部署复杂化）并且未能利用数据库元数据中包含的重要语义上下文。

Method: 我们引入了一种基于组件的检索架构，该架构将数据库模式和元数据分解为离散的语义单元，每个单元分别索引以进行有针对性的检索。我们的方法优先考虑有效的表识别，同时利用列级信息，确保检索到的表总数保持在可管理的上下文预算内。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法保持了高召回率和准确率，并且我们的系统在具有不同结构和可用元海量数据库上的性能优于基线。

Conclusion: 该解决方案支持在各种企业环境中部署实际的文本到SQL系统，无需专门的微调，解决了自然语言数据库接口中的一个关键可扩展性差距。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在处理中文文本歧义时存在问题，无法可靠区分歧义文本，过度自信地解释歧义文本，并且过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）的可信度，重点关注中文文本歧义。

Method: 创建了一个基准数据集，通过收集和生成带有上下文的歧义句及其相应的消歧对，代表多种可能的解释。这些带注释的例子被系统地分为3个主要类别和9个子类别。

Result: 大型语言模型在处理歧义时表现出明显的脆弱性，揭示了与人类截然不同的行为。具体来说，大型语言模型不能可靠地区分歧义文本和非歧义文本，在将歧义文本解释为具有单一含义而不是多种含义时表现出过度自信，并且在试图理解各种可能的含义时表现出过度思考。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型在处理语言歧义方面存在根本性缺陷，这对其在现实世界中的部署有重大影响，因此需要改进处理语言理解中不确定性的方法。

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub
repository: https://github.com/ictup/LLM-Chinese-Textual-Disambiguation.

TL;DR: ISO-Bench 是一个用于评估多模态模型因果推理能力的基准，结果表明现有模型的性能远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解跨模态的因果关系是多模态模型在现实环境中运行的核心挑战。

Method: 介绍了 ISO-Bench，这是一个用于评估模型是否可以推断视觉观察和程序文本之间的因果依赖关系的基准。

Result: 每个例子都提供了一个任务步骤的图像和一个计划中的文本片段，目标是判断视觉步骤发生在引用的文本步骤之前还是之后。

Conclusion: 对十个前沿视觉-语言模型的评估结果显示性能不佳：最佳零样本 F1 值仅为 0.57，而思维链推理仅产生适度的收益（高达 0.62 F1），远落后于人类（0.98 F1）。我们的分析进一步强调了改进多模态模型中因果理解的具体方向。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了从用户-LM交互日志中收集隐式用户反馈，发现用户反馈的内容可以提高模型在简短问题中的性能，但不能提高在更复杂问题中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一旦语言模型（LM）被部署，它们可以与用户进行长期交互，理想情况下，可以根据用户的反馈不断发展。要求直接的用户反馈可能会产生干扰；因此，我们研究从用户-LM交互日志中收集用户反馈。

Method: 研究了两个用户-LM交互数据集（WildChat和LMSYS）中的隐式用户反馈。

Result: 用户反馈的内容（例如，用户想要澄清）可以提高模型在简短的人工设计问题（MTBench）中的性能，但不能提高在更长和更复杂的问题（WildBench）中的性能。我们还发现，用户反馈的有用性在很大程度上与用户初始提示的质量有关。

Conclusion: 对隐式用户反馈进行了深入研究，展示了其潜力和局限性。

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

TL;DR: LENS 是一种通过分析内部表示来学习估计模型置信度的新方法，在多个选择和布尔问答任务上优于传统集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效结合多个 LLM 的预测对于提高系统稳健性和性能至关重要。然而，现有的集成方法通常依赖于简单的技术，如投票或 logits 集成，这些方法忽略了模型在不同上下文中不同的置信度和可靠性。

Method: 提出 LENS（从神经状态学习集成置信度），这是一种通过分析内部表示来学习估计模型置信度的新方法。对于每个 LLM，我们训练一个轻量级线性置信度预测器，它利用层状隐藏状态和归一化概率作为输入。

Result: 在多项选择和布尔问答任务上的实验结果表明，LENS 的性能明显优于传统的集成方法。

Conclusion: 内部表示为确定模型置信度提供了有价值的信号，可以有效地用于集成学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

Motivation: 随着深度学习工作负载的复杂性和多样性增加，自动化底层内核开发以满足性能和生产力需求变得至关重要。对 AI 生成的 GPU 内核的需求正在迅速增长。

Method: GEAK 框架，利用 LLM 生成 Triton 代码，并使用类 Reflexion 反馈机制的推理循环。

Result: 在两个评估基准上，GEAK 的正确率提高了 63%，执行速度提高了 2.59 倍，显著优于直接提示 LLM 和基于 Reflexion 的生成管道的基线。

Conclusion: GEAK 框架通过类 Reflexion 反馈机制的推理循环，利用 LLM 生成高性能 Triton 代码，在 AMD GPU（包括 MI300X 和 MI250）上表现出色，加速了硬件平台的应用并普及了专家级内核性能。

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，该方法利用负样本来更好地选择正样本示例，从而提高少样本 ICL 的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型表现出强大的少样本上下文学习 (ICL) 能力，但性能对提供的示例高度敏感。最近的研究主要强调利用正样本，而忽略了负样本中的额外信息。

Method: 利用基于语义相似性的方法从正样本和负样本语料库中选择最相似的例子，然后基于与负样本的语义相似性从正样本语料库中检索正样本例子。

Result: 我们的方法优于仅依赖于最相似的正样本例子的方法，验证了负样本中的额外信息有助于通过改进正样本选择来提高 ICL 性能。

Conclusion: 利用负样本来更好地选择正样本例子，从而提高少样本 ICL 的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

Motivation: Traditional topic models struggle to capture semantically abstract features. Neural variants are constrained by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate complex topics.

Method: Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs).

Result: MTMs match or exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Conclusion: Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs) can reveal deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. MTMs enable controllable text generation using topic-based steering vectors. MTMs match or exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Motivation: 早期和准确地诊断阿尔茨海默病(AD)这种复杂的神经退行性疾病，需要分析通常以表格格式表示的异质生物标志物(如神经影像、遗传风险因素、认知测试和脑脊液蛋白)。凭借灵活的少镜头推理、多模态集成和基于自然语言的可解释性，大型语言模型(llm)为结构化生物医学数据的预测提供了前所未有的机会。

Method: 我们提出了一个名为TAP-GPT的新框架，即表格阿尔茨海默病预测GPT，该框架改编了TableGPT2(一种最初为商业智能任务开发的多模态表格专用LLM)，用于使用小样本量的结构化生物标志物数据进行AD诊断。我们的方法使用来自结构化生物医学数据的上下文学习示例构建少镜头表格提示，并使用参数有效的qLoRA改编对TableGPT2进行微调，用于AD或认知正常(CN)的临床二元分类任务。

Conclusion: TAP-GPT框架利用TableGPT2强大的表格理解能力和LLM的编码先验知识，优于更先进的通用LLM和为预测任务开发的表格基础模型(TFM)。据我们所知，这是llm在表格生物标志物数据预测任务中的首次应用，为未来生物医学信息学中由LLM驱动的多智能体框架铺平了道路。

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Conclusion: Mistral和Qwen在心理健康领域表现出强大的推理能力。Claude-3.5-haiku在处理与心理健康相关的污名化问题上比其他两个大型语言模型更负责任。

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to

Motivation: 孟加拉语在 NLP 研究中是一种代表性不足的语言，但由于其独特的语言结构和计算限制，仍然是一个挑战。这项工作系统地调查了阻碍孟加拉语 NLP 性能的挑战，重点是缺乏标准化评估基准。

Method: 通过翻译的数据集评估了 10 个最近的开源大型语言模型（LLM），并进行了全面的错误分析，以查明其主要失败模式。

Result: 研究结果表明，与英语相比，孟加拉语的表现始终存在差距，特别是对于较小的模型和特定的模型系列（如 Mistral）。我们还发现某些架构（如 DeepSeek）具有良好的鲁棒性，可以在不同语言中保持更稳定的性能。我们的分析揭示了分词效率和 LLM 准确性之间的反比关系，当输入被过度分词时，模型往往表现更差，而更有效和简洁的分词会导致性能的提高。

Conclusion: 当前模型在处理孟加拉语时存在不足，需要改进数据集质量和评估方法，以促进对代表性不足语言的 NLP 研究。

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly
available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

*Zunhai Su,Qingyuan Li,Hao Zhang,YuLei Qian,Yuchen Xie,Kehong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Identified and analyzed Super Experts (SEs) in MoE LLMs, showing their crucial role in model performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning, and their impact on attention sinks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the heterogeneous importance of experts

Method: discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference

Result: These experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance

Conclusion: MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly disrupted by SE pruning.

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 先前研究主要集中在显式训练模型来调节敏感内容和消除其毒性，而对 LLM 在没有明确指令的情况下是否隐式清理语言的探索有限。

Method: 通过释义敏感内容，实证分析 GPT-4o-mini 的隐式调节行为，并评估敏感度转移的程度。

Result: GPT-4o-mini 系统性地缓和内容，使其朝着不太敏感的类别发展，显着减少了贬损和禁忌语言。LLM 在对句子敏感性进行分类方面的 zero-shot 能力，与传统方法相比，评估了它们的性能。

Conclusion: GPT-4o-mini 系统性地缓和内容，使其朝着不太敏感的类别发展，显着减少了贬损和禁忌语言。

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

*Yiyan Ji,Haoran Chen,Qiguang Chen,Chengyue Wu,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的多模态规划基准测试 MPCC，发现现有模型在处理复杂约束下的现实世界规划任务时表现不佳，强调了在约束感知推理方面取得进展的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试无法直接评估多模态现实世界规划能力，并且缺乏跨模态的约束或隐式约束。

Method: 该论文提出了一个新的基准测试，即具有复杂约束的多模态规划 (MPCC)，用于系统地评估 MLLM 在规划中处理多模态约束的能力。MPCC 侧重于三个现实世界的任务：航班规划、日历规划和会议规划，并在这些任务中引入了复杂约束（例如预算、时间和空间），具有分级的难度级别。

Result: 在 13 个先进的 MLLM 上的实验表明，闭源模型仅实现了 21.3% 的可行计划，而开源模型的平均水平低于 11%。MLLM 对约束复杂性高度敏感，并且传统的多模态提示策略在多约束场景中失败。

Conclusion: 这篇论文表明，现有的多模态语言模型在处理复杂约束下的多模态规划任务时面临重大挑战，尤其是在现实世界的应用中。

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

*Ailiang Lin,Zhuoyun Li,Kotaro Funakoshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Causal2Vec是一种用于增强解码器LLM性能的通用嵌入模型，无需改变其原始架构或引入显著的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要集中在移除LLM中的因果注意力掩码以启用双向注意力，这可能会削弱模型在预训练期间获取语义信息的能力。此外，领先的单向方法通常依赖于额外的输入文本来克服因果注意力的固有局限性，不可避免地增加了计算成本。

Method: 使用轻量级BERT风格的模型将输入文本预编码为单个上下文token，然后将其添加到LLM的输入序列中。连接上下文和EOS token的最后隐藏状态作为最终文本嵌入。

Result: Causal2Vec在MTEB上实现了最先进的性能，同时显著降低了序列长度和推理时间。

Conclusion: Causal2Vec在公开检索数据集上训练的模型中，在MTEB上实现了最先进的性能，同时与最佳方法相比，所需序列长度减少了高达85%，推理时间减少了高达82%。

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的迅速普及给翻译领域带来了机遇和挑战。虽然商业的、基于云的人工智能聊天机器人在翻译研究中受到了广泛关注，但对数据隐私、安全和公平访问的担忧使得有必要探索替代的部署模型。

Method: 这项研究评估了安装在基于CPU的平台上的三个开源模型，并与商业上可用的在线聊天机器人进行了比较。评估侧重于功能性能，而不是人机翻译质量的比较分析，这是一个已经受到广泛研究的领域。选择评估的平台是因为它们在各种操作系统上的可访问性和易用性。

Result: 这项研究调查了本地可部署的自由语言模型作为专有的、基于云的人工智能解决方案的可行性和性能。

Conclusion: 本地部署引入了自身的挑战，但增强数据控制、改善隐私和减少对云服务的依赖的好处是引人注目的。这项研究的结果有助于不断增长的关于人工智能技术民主化的知识体系，并为未来的研究和开发工作提供信息，旨在使LLM更易于访问和更实用，适用于更广泛的用户，特别是关注个体翻译人员和小型企业的需求。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

Conclusion: 该方法有效地重建了城市规模的场景，并且在效率和质量上均优于以前的方法。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

Conclusion: ScanDiff 在自由观看和任务驱动场景中均超越了现有技术水平，生成了更多样化和准确的扫描路径，更好地捕捉了人类视觉行为的复杂性，推动了注视预测研究。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

Motivation: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR) techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored.

Conclusion: PATA can preserve rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64% and running power by 61.55%.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

TL;DR: NovaDrive, a vision-language architecture, improves autonomous vehicle navigation by processing multi-modal inputs and fine-tuning a large language model, achieving state-of-the-art results on driving benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations.

Method: a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference.

Result: On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: NovaDrive raises success rate and boosts path-efficiency, and reduces collision frequency relative to the previous state-of-the-art. And it can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

Motivation: Safety-critical applications require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability to be useful.

AnydoorMed extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans.

Conclusion: foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable and multimodal counterfactual scenarios

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model

Result: attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify them. Existing individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but complementary.

Method: The solution follows the two-stage scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. It employs robust 3D tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the classification stage, the standard CLIP model is replaced with Alpha-CLIP, which incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, the standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score is introduced to normalize text-to-proposal similarity.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS across all AP and AR metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary method.

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify

complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models

Method: a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

Method: a framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion -- within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning approach

Result: superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16% improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset.

Conclusion: The 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for advancing motion acquisition.

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for

Result: AGD在攻击性能和模型对某些防御的鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGD在攻击性能和模型对某些防御的鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is difficult due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective.

Method: A supervised baseline model generates segmentation pseudo-labels, then an instance classification model performs pixel-wise segmentation. A post-processing module preserves crystal properties.

Result: The method improves true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully classifies potential agglomerated instances and improves true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution predictions compared to other existing methods.

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using

this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Semi-FSCIL studies have a narrow perspective by assuming unlabeled data is only from novel classes.  GSemi-FSCIL is introduced to better reflect real-world scenarios by including base and all ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled set.

Method: Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy

Result: ALDC dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions for few-shot novel classes.

Conclusion: The proposed ALDC method outperforms existing works on three benchmark datasets, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an

TL;DR: RL-QR是一种用于RAG系统查询优化的强化学习框架，它在多模态和词汇检索器上有效，但在语义检索器上效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化查询对于检索增强生成（RAG）系统至关重要，但为各种非结构化真实文档优化查询仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于强化学习的检索器特定查询重写框架RL-QR，无需人工标注数据集，并利用广义奖励策略优化（GRPO）训练查询重写器。

Result: RL-QR在工业内部数据上的实验表明，多模态RAG的NDCG@3相对提升了11%，词汇检索器的NDCG@3提升了9%。

Conclusion: RL-QR在多模态和词汇检索器上表现出显著的改进，但未能提升语义和混合检索器的性能，暗示训练存在偏差。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

TL;DR: Developed a comprehensive diffusion tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain using multi-stage fiber clustering on HCP data, achieving high spatial correspondence with expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping a comprehensive and detailed CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain.

Method: The CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP).

Result: Quantitative and visual experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of pituitary adenoma patients.

Conclusion: The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8 fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II, oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN

Method: 论文对三种目标跟踪类别进行了全面的回顾，重点关注快速发展的基于 Transformer 的方法。通过统一的视觉和表格比较，对代表性方法进行了比较。

Result: 论文引入了一种新的分类方法，并从多个角度组织了现有跟踪器，总结了主要评估基准，强调了基于 Transformer 的跟踪技术在强大时空建模能力的驱动下的快速发展。

Conclusion: 论文全面回顾了基于 Siamese、判别式和 Transformer 的通用目标跟踪方法，通过定性和定量比较分析了每种方法的核心设计原则、创新和局限性，并从多个角度组织了现有跟踪器，总结了主要评估基准。

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

*Mingyang Yu,Xiahui Guo,Peng chen,Zhenkai Li,Yang Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TGSI, a new metric for evaluating the geometric structure of time series, and SATL, a loss function that improves structure modeling during training, leading to better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data, which is essential to understand temporal dynamics.

Method: We propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent two-dimensional geometric representations. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training. SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss, a frequency domain loss, and a perceptual feature loss.

Result: Models trained with SATL achieve superior performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

Conclusion: Models trained with SATL achieve superior performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SATL, a novel approach for multi-label image recognition with partial labels that dynamically learns category-specific thresholds, improving performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) often overlook the varying score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance.

Method: The Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm calculates category-specific thresholds based on the score distribution for positive and negative samples, dynamically updated throughout the learning process. A differential ranking loss is implemented to enhance threshold discrimination.

Result: The Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm significantly improves performance in scenarios with limited labels on large-scale multi-label datasets, such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200.

Conclusion: The proposed SATL method significantly improves performance in multi-label image recognition with partial labels, as demonstrated on Microsoft COCO and VG-200 datasets.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

TL;DR: The paper proposes PixelNerd, a single-stage diffusion model using neural fields, achieving good results on image and text-to-image generation without VAEs or complex pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion transformers rely on VAEs, leading to accumulated errors and decoding artifacts. Returning to pixel space introduces complexity.

Method: The paper models patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale, single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field diffusion~(PixelNerd).

Result: PixelNerd achieves 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. PixNerd-XXL/16 achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9 overall score on the DPG benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper introduces PixelNerd, a single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution for diffusion modeling by modeling patch-wise decoding with neural fields. It achieves competitive results on image generation and text-to-image generation benchmarks without VAE or complex cascade pipelines.

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了 SAM2 是否可以适应乳房 MRI 中的低成本、minimal-input 3D 肿瘤分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳房 MRI 提供高分辨率体积成像，这对于肿瘤评估和治疗计划至关重要，但 3D 扫描的手动解释仍然 labor-intensive 且主观。虽然人工智能工具在加速医学图像分析方面很有前景，但由于许可成本高、专有软件和基础设施需求，商业医学人工智能产品在低收入和中等收入国家的采用仍然有限。

Method: 使用一个切片上的单个边界框注释，我们使用三种不同的切片式跟踪策略在 3D 体积中传播分割预测：从上到下、从下到上和从中心向外。

Result: 中心向外传播产生最一致和准确的分割。尽管是未经训练用于体积医学数据的零样本模型，但 SAM2 在最少的监督下实现了强大的分割性能。

Conclusion: SAM2等通用基础模型可以在最少的监督下支持3D医学图像分析，为资源受限的环境提供了一种可访问且经济实惠的替代方案。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展且高效的前馈3D重建方法iLRM，通过迭代细化和两阶段注意力机制，实现了高质量和快速的3D重建，并在大规模数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer架构的方法存在严重的可扩展性问题，因为它们依赖于来自多个输入视图的图像token之间的完全注意力，导致随着视图数量或图像分辨率的增加，计算成本过高。

Method: 引入了一种迭代式大型3D重建模型（iLRM），该模型通过迭代细化机制生成3D高斯表示，并遵循三个核心原则：（1）将场景表示与输入视图图像解耦，以实现紧凑的3D表示；（2）将完全注意力的多视图交互分解为两阶段注意方案，以降低计算成本；（3）在每一层注入高分辨率信息，以实现高保真重建。

Result: 在RE10K和DL3DV等广泛使用的数据集上的实验结果表明，iLRM在重建质量和速度方面优于现有方法。值得注意的是，iLRM表现出卓越的可扩展性，通过有效地利用大量输入视图，在相当的计算成本下提供显着更高的重建质量。

Conclusion: iLRM在重建质量和速度方面优于现有方法，并且具有卓越的可扩展性，通过有效地利用大量输入视图，在相当的计算成本下提供显着更高的重建质量。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLIP扩展了CLIP，使其能够进行重建、生成和编辑，同时保持其卓越的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以前基于CLIP的统一方法通常需要额外的扩散解码器或量化来支持重建和生成任务，从而导致不一致的重建或原始理解性能的下降。

Method: 我们引入了一种两阶段训练方案和一种自蒸馏策略，该策略逐步将重建能力集成到CLIP中，使其能够保持原始的理解性能，同时实现有效的图像重建。此外，我们提出了一种双重条件架构来连接MLLM和扩散transformer，使用可学习的查询和最后一层多模态隐藏状态作为联合条件。

Result: 在文本到图像生成任务中，UniLIP在GenEval和WISE基准测试中分别获得0.87和0.53的分数，超过了之前所有类似规模的统一模型。在图像编辑方面，UniLIP在ImgEdit基准测试中也获得了3.62的分数，超过了最近最先进的模型，如BAGEL和UniWorld-V1。

Conclusion: UniLIP有效地扩展了CLIP的应用范围，使其连续CLIP特征不仅可以作为理解任务的最佳选择，而且在生成和编辑任务中也实现了极具竞争力的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)的简单应用，即基于候选可能性的检索，引入了候选先验偏差，偏向于那些固有先验较高的候选，而不是那些与查询更相关的候选。

Result: BLiM配备CPN在四个文本-视频检索基准测试中，平均比之前的最佳模型高出6.4 R@1，有效缓解了候选先验偏差，并强调了查询-候选相关性。

Conclusion: BLiM配备CPN在四个文本-视频检索基准测试中，平均比之前的最佳模型高出6.4 R@1，有效缓解了候选先验偏差，并强调了查询-候选相关性。在检索之外的各种多模态任务中进行的深入分析突出了CPN的广泛适用性，它通过减少对文本先验的依赖来增强视觉理解。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

Conclusion: FreeFine outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity and edit precision, especially under demanding transformations.

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an

coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSCOD methods based on Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures incur high computational overhead and limited scalability.

Method: ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.

Result: ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods.

Conclusion: ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance

abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

TL;DR: PriorFusion, a unified framework that integrates semantic, geometric, and generative priors, enhances road element perception by using an instance-aware attention mechanism, a data-driven shape template space, and a diffusion-based framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an increasing demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies in complex environments without high-definition map support. Existing approaches have insufficient exploitation of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in irregular, inaccurate predictions.

Method: The paper proposes PriorFusion, a unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and generative priors to enhance road element perception. It introduces an instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features and constructs a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points as reference priors. A diffusion-based framework leverages these prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions.

Result: Experiments on large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that the PriorFusion method significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed PriorFusion method significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging conditions, and produces more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在很大程度上可以区分内容和风格，但程度取决于具体的艺术提示和要求的风格。内容标记主要影响与对象相关的区域，而风格标记影响背景和纹理区域，这表明对内容-风格的区别有了初步的理解。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT

trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,

TL;DR: FastDriveVLA is a new vision token pruning framework for autonomous driving that uses foreground reconstruction to improve performance and reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long visual tokens in VLA models increase computational costs, and existing visual token pruning methods perform poorly in autonomous driving. Human drivers focus on foreground areas, so retaining visual tokens containing this information is crucial.

Method: The paper proposes FastDriveVLA, a reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework with a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner. It uses MAE-style pixel reconstruction and an adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy to train ReconPruner. A new dataset, nuScenes-FG, is also introduced.

Result: FastDriveVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed FastDriveVLA framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

TL;DR: FASTopoWM, a fast-slow lane segment topology reasoning framework with latent world models, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in lane segment detection and centerline perception by addressing limitations of temporal information usage, pose estimation failures, and temporal propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lane topology reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently, stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation.

Method: a novel fast-slow lane segment topology reasoning framework augmented with latent world models

Result: FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5% on OLS).

Conclusion: FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment detection and centerline perception.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床工作流程中起着至关重要的作用，但是，当模型应用于看不见的临床领域时，领域转移通常会导致性能下降。由于成像条件、扫描仪类型和采集协议的变化，出现了这一挑战，限制了分割模型的实际部署。与自然图像不同，医学图像通常在患者之间表现出一致的解剖结构，而领域特异性变化主要由成像条件引起。这种独特的特性使得医学图像分割特别具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种针对医学图像分割的领域泛化框架，通过引入由领域统计信息引导的隐式特征扰动来提高对领域特定变化的鲁棒性。采用可学习的语义方向选择器和基于协方差的语义强度采样器来调节领域变异特征，同时保持任务相关的解剖学一致性。设计了一种自适应一致性约束，仅在特征调整导致分割性能下降时才选择性地应用该约束。该约束鼓励调整后的特征与原始预测对齐，从而稳定特征选择并提高分割的可靠性。

Result: 该框架在不同的临床领域实现了稳健和可推广的分割性能，优于现有的领域泛化方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在两个公共多中心基准测试中表现优异，在不同的临床领域实现了稳健和可推广的分割性能，优于现有的领域泛化方法。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Conclusion: 该模型在长尾检测任务中达到了最先进的 78.4% mAP， 并且在复杂场景中表现出优越的准确性和泛化性。

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

Motivation: analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision

Method: examining six influential papers

Result: reviews ResNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), DINO, and Masked Autoencoders (MAE)

Conclusion: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) provide a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

Motivation: Practical applications of LVLMs are limited by massive model parameters and high computational costs. Directly applying NLP layer pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective due to modality divergence between vision and language.

Method: A novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps.

Result: Directly applying NLP layer pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs.

Conclusion: Short-LVLM achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency. It is training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible.

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

*Yijie Zhu,Lingsen Zhang,Zitong Yu,Rui Shao,Tao Tan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniEmo是一个统一的框架，集成了情感理解和生成任务，通过双重反馈过程显著提高了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感理解和生成通常被视为独立的任务，然而它们本质上是互补的，并且可以相互促进。

Method: 提出了一个统一的框架UniEmo，它无缝集成了情感理解和生成这两个任务。该框架采用分层情感理解链，利用可学习的专家查询逐步提取多尺度情感特征。同时，融合这些专家查询和情感表示，以指导扩散模型生成能够唤起情感的图像。为了增强生成的情感图像的多样性和保真度，进一步引入了情感相关系数和情感条件损失。

Result: 联合训练使得生成组件能够为理解部分提供隐式反馈。此外，还提出了一种新颖的数据过滤算法，用于选择由训练良好的模型生成的高质量和多样化的情感图像，这些图像显式地反馈到理解部分。这些生成驱动的双重反馈过程增强了模型的理解能力。

Conclusion: UniEmo在情感理解和生成任务中显著优于现有技术水平的方法。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进对齐策略MP^2A，用于无监督域自适应，通过逐步引入更具挑战性的样本来缓解确认偏差，并在多个UDA基准测试中实现了SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法试图同时使用所有伪标记数据来对齐源域和目标域，这种一次性对齐难以处理噪声样本，导致误差传播和次优特征学习。多源场景中，不同域的差异和噪声水平进一步破坏了对齐过程。

Method: 提出了一种渐进对齐策略，用于将CLIP适应到未标记的下游任务。

Result: MP^2A实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MP^2A在三个流行的UDA基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: NeRF-GS结合了NeRF和3DGS的优点，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用NeRF固有的连续空间表示来减轻3DGS的几个局限性，包括对高斯初始化敏感、空间感知有限以及高斯间相关性较弱，从而提高其性能。

Method: 共同优化神经辐射场（NeRF）和3D高斯溅射（3DGS）。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，NeRF-GS超越了现有方法，并达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: NeRF和3DGS是互补的，为结合3DGS和NeRF以实现高效3D场景表示的混合方法提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

*Wei Li,Xun Gong,Jiao Li,Xiaobin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的医学图像和报告的视觉-语言预训练框架，通过自适应分组对齐来捕获结构化语义，并在图像-文本检索和分类任务中取得了良好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学领域视觉-语言预训练方法通常将临床报告简化为单个实体或碎片化的tokens，忽略了它们固有的结构。此外，对比学习框架通常依赖于大量的困难负样本，这对于小规模医学数据集是不切实际的。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架，自适应分组对齐 (AGA)，它从配对的医学图像和报告中捕获结构化语义。AGA 引入了一种基于稀疏相似性矩阵的双向分组机制。为实现自适应分组，我们设计了两个阈值门控模块，称为语言分组阈值门和视觉分组阈值门，它们动态地学习分组阈值。我们引入了一种实例感知组对齐损失，该损失在每个图像-文本对中运行，无需外部负样本。应用双向跨模态分组对齐模块以增强视觉和语言组表示之间的细粒度对齐。

Result: 在公共和私有数据集上进行的大量实验表明，该方法在微调和零样本设置下的图像-文本检索和分类任务中取得了强大的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在图像-文本检索和分类任务中表现出色，无论是在微调还是零样本设置下。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SBDDM offers a faster and more accurate way to detect anomalies in medical images compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative OOD detection methods are computationally expensive, unreliable, and require retraining, hindering their ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently.

Method: A reconstruction-free OOD detection method leveraging forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising diffusion model (SBDDM).

Result: SBDDM achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Near-OOD and Far-OOD detection and reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: SBDDM achieves state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection with lower computational cost, improving Near-OOD and Far-OOD detection by up to 10.43% and 18.10% respectively.

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该系统能够以 96.39% 的交叉验证准确率检测蜂蜜中的掺假行为，使其成为当前化学检测方法的合适替代品。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

TL;DR: 研究了 MLLM 中推理能力和偏差缓解之间的权衡，发现使用强化学习的 1:4 混合训练样本可以在减少偏差的同时保持较高的推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 在各种任务和模式中已经取得了最先进的结果。为了进一步提高他们的推理能力，最近的研究探索了先进的提示方案和后训练微调。虽然这些技术提高了逻辑准确性，但它们经常使模型的输出带有明显的社会偏见。因此，阐明推理收益如何与偏差缓解相互作用，以及这两个目标是否inherently trade off，仍然是一个开放且紧迫的研究问题。

Method: 对三种偏差缓解策略（监督微调 SFT、知识蒸馏 KD 和基于规则的强化学习 RL）进行了基准测试，并在每种范例中改变了以去偏见为重点和以推理为中心的样本比例。

Result: 揭示了一个一致的最佳点：大约 1:4 的混合训练样本通过强化学习将刻板印象分数降低了 10%，同时保留了模型 88% 的原始推理准确率，为平衡 MLLM 中的公平性和能力提供了具体的指导。

Conclusion: 在强化学习中，大约 1:4 的混合训练样本可以在减少刻板印象的同时，保持模型原有的推理准确率。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

Motivation: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly.

Method: introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917 challenges across seven categories

Result: evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models reveals a striking failure rate exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%)

Conclusion: current AI systems lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene analysis.

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

Motivation: 当这些意见围绕预测形成论证结构时，从论证的角度研究预测的属性是有用的。

Method: 形式化地定义了一种论证连贯性的属性

Result: 强制执行连贯性对人工预测者以及基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的预测者的影响。在两种情况下，过滤掉不连贯的预测可以持续提高预测准确率

Conclusion: 过滤掉不连贯的预测可以提高预测准确率，这表明连贯性在人工和基于 LLM 的预测中都具有实际价值。用户通常不符合这种连贯性属性，因此需要在基于论证的判断预测中整合机制，以过滤掉不连贯的意见，然后再获得群体预测。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

Motivation: 量化查询答案的定量方法使用责任度量来为事实分配分数，以便量化它们对获得给定答案的各自贡献。

Method: 研究了在本体介导的查询应答中计算此类责任分数的复杂性，重点关注最近引入的一系列基于 Shapley 值的责任度量，这些度量是根据最小支持的加权和 (WSMS) 定义的。

Result: 通过利用数据库设置的结果，我们可以证明这些措施对于一阶可重写的本体介导的查询类具有多项式数据复杂性。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的ReLU评分方法（SAS），并将其应用于Hybrid MILP，以实现高效且准确的CNN验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了处理复杂实例，我们重新审视分而治之的方法来分解复杂性：我们依赖于许多小的partial MILP调用，而不是少数复杂的BaB调用。关键步骤是选择非常少但非常重要的ReLU，以使用（昂贵的）二进制变量进行处理。先前的尝试在这方面是次优的。

Method: 提出了一种新的解决方案感知ReLU评分（SAS），并调整BaB-SR和BaB-FSB分支函数作为全局ReLU评分（GS）函数。

Result: 与之前的尝试相比，SAS将二进制变量的数量减少了约6倍，同时保持了相同的精度水平。

Conclusion: Hybrid MILP实现了高效且准确的验证器，对于具有两百万参数的大型CNN，可以将未确定实例的数量减少多达40％，降至较低水平（8-15％），同时保持合理的运行时间（平均每个实例46秒-417秒）。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Method: 因果解释和对比因果解释

Result: 证明了因果解释的形式属性，并为图像分类器引入了对比因果解释。定义了具有置信度意识的解释，并引入了完整的因果解释：以与原始图像完全相同的置信度进行分类的解释。

Conclusion: 不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性方面具有不同的模式。该算法是完全黑盒的，不需要了解模型，不需要访问模型内部，不需要访问梯度，也不需要模型的任何属性，例如单调性。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Motivation: The effectiveness of ICL is highly sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often leading to unstable or degraded performance.

Method: DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components through a causal lens, and proposes a stepwise selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.

Result: DICE demonstrates effectiveness and generality across diverse domains.

Conclusion: DICE is effective and general, highlighting the importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient LLM agents.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Motivation: 在协作系统中，任务的有效完成取决于对潜在设备进行特定于任务的信任评估。然而，任务的复杂性、分布式设备资源的时空动态性以及不可避免的评估开销大大增加了信任评估过程的复杂性和资源消耗。因此，不合时宜或过于频繁的信任评估会降低受限资源的利用率，从而对协作任务的执行产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于语义信任链的自主信任编排方法，通过实验证明了该方法能够实现资源高效的信任评估。

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MemoCue, a strategy-guided agent for memory recall that uses a 5W Recall Map and Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate cue-rich queries, outperforming existing LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited size of memory module hinders the acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed strategy to help the person recall memories.

Method: We design a 5W Recall Map to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in providing memory-inspired responses.

Result: MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall inspiration.

Conclusion: Experiments on three representative datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in memory-recall applications.

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release

Conclusion: 这篇论文通过形式验证和长链思维推理，在自动数学推理方面取得了显著进展。Seed-Prover 证明了 78.1% 的已形式化的往届 IMO 问题，完全解决了 MiniF2F，并在 PutnamBench 上实现了超过 50% 的性能。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

TL;DR: CoT-Self-Instruct 是一种新的数据生成方法，可以显著提高 LLM 在推理和指令跟随任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升大型语言模型在可验证推理和非验证指令跟随任务中的性能。

Method: CoT-Self-Instruct，一种合成数据生成方法，指示大型语言模型（LLM）首先基于给定的种子任务通过 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 进行推理和规划，然后生成新的、质量和复杂性相似的合成提示，用于 LLM 训练，随后使用自动指标过滤高质量数据。

Result: 在 MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 和 GPQA-Diamond 等数据集上，合成数据显著优于 s1k 和 OpenMathReasoning 等现有训练数据集。在 AlpacaEval 2.0 和 Arena-Hard 上，该方法优于人工或标准自指令提示。

Conclusion: CoT-Self-Instruct 在可验证推理和非验证指令跟随任务中，显著优于现有训练数据集或人工/标准自指令提示。

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that
instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the
given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar
quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for
high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our
synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For
non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the
performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 构建的 AI 智能体主要采用“一个任务一个智能体”的方法，这种方法不仅缺乏可扩展性和通用性，而且还受到自回归 LLM 的根本限制。

Method: 提出了一种名为 SimuRA 的面向目标的架构，用于通用智能体推理。该架构基于最优智能体的原则性公式，并引入了一个世界模型，用于通过模拟进行规划。

Result: 在具有挑战性的网络浏览任务中，SimuRA 将航班搜索的成功率从 0% 提高到 32.2%。基于世界模型的规划比自回归规划显示出高达 124% 的持续优势。

Conclusion: SimuRA，一个基于 LLM 构建的通用智能体模型，通过世界模型模拟进行规划，在各种环境中表现出卓越的推理能力，并有望实现通用智能。

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: AutoIndexer 通过结合工作负载压缩、查询优化和专用 RL 模型，有效扩展索引选择，从而显著降低了搜索复杂性，同时没有牺牲太多的索引质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对于处理大规模分析工作负载的系统来说，高效地选择索引对于数据库性能优化至关重要。虽然深度强化学习 (DRL) 通过其从经验中学习的能力，在自动化索引选择方面显示出了希望，但由于动作空间呈指数增长和大量的反复试验，很少有研究关注这些基于 RL 的索引顾问如何适应扩展的工作负载。

Method: 结合工作负载压缩、查询优化和专用 RL 模型来有效扩展索引选择。

Result: 与非索引基线相比，端到端查询执行时间最多可减少 95%。平均而言，在工作负载成本节省方面，它比最先进的基于 RL 的索引顾问高出约 20%，同时调整时间减少了 50% 以上。

Conclusion: AutoIndexer在减少端到端查询执行时间方面表现出色，相对于非索引基线最多可减少 95%。

Abstract: Efficiently selecting indexes is fundamental to database performance
optimization, particularly for systems handling large-scale analytical
workloads. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in
automating index selection through its ability to learn from experience, few
works address how these RL-based index advisors can adapt to scaling workloads
due to exponentially growing action spaces and heavy trial and error. To
address these challenges, we introduce AutoIndexer, a framework that combines
workload compression, query optimization, and specialized RL models to scale
index selection effectively. By operating on compressed workloads, AutoIndexer
substantially lowers search complexity without sacrificing much index quality.
Extensive evaluations show that it reduces end-to-end query execution time by
up to 95% versus non-indexed baselines. On average, it outperforms
state-of-the-art RL-based index advisors by approximately 20% in workload cost
savings while cutting tuning time by over 50%. These results affirm
AutoIndexer's practicality for large and diverse workloads.

TL;DR: Jelly-Patch是一种用于RDF数据集更改的高性能压缩二进制序列化格式，可显著提高大规模和低延迟RDF系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型和低延迟RDF应用中，大量和频繁的更新可能导致更改的序列化和传输中的性能瓶颈。为了缓解这个问题。

Method: 我们提出了Jelly-Patch——一种用于RDF数据集更改的高性能压缩二进制序列化格式。

Result: Jelly-Patch的压缩率提高了3.5-8.9倍，序列化和解析的吞吐量分别提高了2.5倍和4.6倍。

Conclusion: Jelly-Patch显著提高了大规模和低延迟RDF系统的性能。

Abstract: Recording data changes in RDF systems is a crucial capability, needed to
support auditing, incremental backups, database replication, and event-driven
workflows. In large-scale and low-latency RDF applications, the high volume and
frequency of updates can cause performance bottlenecks in the serialization and
transmission of changes. To alleviate this, we propose Jelly-Patch -- a
high-performance, compressed binary serialization format for changes in RDF
datasets. To evaluate its performance, we benchmark Jelly-Patch against
existing RDF Patch formats, using two datasets representing different use cases
(change data capture and IoT streams). Jelly-Patch is shown to achieve
3.5--8.9x better compression, and up to 2.5x and 4.6x higher throughput in
serialization and parsing, respectively. These significant advancements in
throughput and compression are expected to improve the performance of
large-scale and low-latency RDF systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of publicly available textual resources presents challenges in efficiently identifying relevant resources, and existing repositories lack advanced search and exploration features.

Method: Combining faceted search with advanced visualization techniques, including network-based visualizations and chained views.

Result: A user study revealed that users highly value visualization tools, especially network-based exploration.

Conclusion: DataLens, a web-based platform, enhances resource discovery through faceted search and advanced visualization techniques, offering network-based visualizations and chained views.

Abstract: The rapid growth of publicly available textual resources, such as lexicons
and domain-specific corpora, presents challenges in efficiently identifying
relevant resources. While repositories are emerging, they often lack advanced
search and exploration features. Most search methods rely on keyword queries
and metadata filtering, which require prior knowledge and fail to reveal
connections between resources. To address this, we present DataLens, a
web-based platform that combines faceted search with advanced visualization
techniques to enhance resource discovery. DataLens offers network-based
visualizations, where the network structure can be adapted to suit the specific
analysis task. It also supports a chained views approach, enabling users to
explore data from multiple perspectives. A formative user study involving six
data practitioners revealed that users highly value visualization
tools-especially network-based exploration-and offered insights to help refine
our approach to better support dataset search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文通过量化其不确定性来研究推荐器的自我意识，这提供了对其性能的无标签估计。这种自我评估可以在推荐器与任何用户互动之前实现更明智的理解和决策。

Method: 提出了一种直观有效的方法，即基于概率的列表分布不确定性（LiDu）。LiDu 通过确定推荐器基于单个项目的预测分布生成特定排名列表的概率来衡量不确定性。

Result: 实验结果表明，与一系列无标签性能估计器相比，LiDu 与推荐性能的相关性更高。此外，LiDu 提供了对整个训练和推理过程中模型动态内部状态的宝贵见解。

Conclusion: 建立推荐不确定性和性能之间的经验联系，并将其构建为迈向更透明和自我评估的推荐系统的一步。

Abstract: Can a recommendation model be self-aware? This paper investigates the
recommender's self-awareness by quantifying its uncertainty, which provides a
label-free estimation of its performance. Such self-assessment can enable more
informed understanding and decision-making before the recommender engages with
any users. To this end, we propose an intuitive and effective method,
probability-based List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu). LiDu measures
uncertainty by determining the probability that a recommender will generate a
certain ranking list based on the prediction distributions of individual items.
We validate LiDu's ability to represent model self-awareness in two settings:
(1) with a matrix factorization model on a synthetic dataset, and (2) with
popular recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets. Experimental results
show that LiDu is more correlated with recommendation performance than a series
of label-free performance estimators. Additionally, LiDu provides valuable
insights into the dynamic inner states of models throughout training and
inference. This work establishes an empirical connection between recommendation
uncertainty and performance, framing it as a step towards more transparent and
self-evaluating recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches overlook dynamic intervals between items, which serve as a dimension for user profiling.

Method: Integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates interval-infused attention.

Result: IntervalLLM achieves 4.4% improvements and best performance in warm and cold scenarios. The cold scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant performance drop.

Conclusion: IntervalLLM achieves 4.4% improvements and best performance in warm and cold scenarios. Interval-based cold challenges need further research.

Abstract: Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential
recommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and
often overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However,
dynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not
only the history within a user but also different users with the same item
history. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that
integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel
interval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and
intervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start
scenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new
viewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for
evaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive
experiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines
demonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average
but also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items,
and the proposed interval perspectives. In addition, we observe that the cold
scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant
performance drop among all recommendation methods. This finding underscores the
necessity of further research on interval-based cold challenges and our
integration of interval information in the realm of sequential recommendation
tasks. Our code is available here:

TL;DR: This paper introduces nuFormer, a transformer-based representation learning model for transaction data, demonstrating improved recommendation performance at Nubank through enhanced representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging user data effectively remains challenging due to its complexity and scale. Most production models follow traditional machine learning approaches by converting unstructured data into manually engineered tabular features. Other domains have effectively utilized self-supervised learning to learn rich representations from raw data, removing the need for manual feature extraction. The paper investigates using transformer-based representation learning models for transaction data.

Method: propose a new method enabling the use of SSL with transaction data by adapting transformer-based models to handle both textual and structured attributes. Includes an end-to-end fine-tuning method that integrates user embeddings with existing tabular features

Result: Improvements for large-scale recommendation problems at Nubank are achieved solely through enhanced representation learning.

Conclusion: The experiments demonstrate improvements for large-scale recommendation problems at Nubank, achieved solely through enhanced representation learning.

Abstract: Predictive models play a crucial role in the financial industry, enabling
risk prediction, fraud detection, and personalized recommendations, where
slight changes in core model performance can result in billions of dollars in
revenue or losses. While financial institutions have access to enormous amounts
of user data (e.g., bank transactions, in-app events, and customer support
logs), leveraging this data effectively remains challenging due to its
complexity and scale. Thus, in many financial institutions, most production
models follow traditional machine learning (ML) approaches by converting
unstructured data into manually engineered tabular features. Conversely, other
domains (e.g., natural language processing) have effectively utilized
self-supervised learning (SSL) to learn rich representations from raw data,
removing the need for manual feature extraction. In this paper, we investigate
using transformer-based representation learning models for transaction data,
hypothesizing that these models, trained on massive data, can provide a novel
and powerful approach to understanding customer behavior. We propose a new
method enabling the use of SSL with transaction data by adapting
transformer-based models to handle both textual and structured attributes. Our
approach, denoted nuFormer, includes an end-to-end fine-tuning method that
integrates user embeddings with existing tabular features. Our experiments
demonstrate improvements for large-scale recommendation problems at Nubank.
Notably, these gains are achieved solely through enhanced representation
learning rather than incorporating new data sources.

Result: 在每日活跃用户 (DAU) 和用户生命周期 (LT) 方面分别获得了 +0.205% 和 +0.192% 的提升。

Conclusion: KLAN在快手平台上进行了广泛的在线实验，证明了其有效性，在每日活跃用户 (DAU) 和用户生命周期 (LT) 方面分别获得了 +0.205% 和 +0.192% 的提升。我们的 KLAN 最终部署在全流量的在线平台上，为数亿用户提供服务。为了促进对这一重要领域的进一步研究，我们将在论文发表后发布我们的数据集和代码。

Abstract: Modern online platforms configure multiple pages to accommodate diverse user
needs. This multi-page architecture inherently establishes a two-stage
interaction paradigm between the user and the platform: (1) Stage I: page
navigation, navigating users to a specific page and (2) Stage II: in-page
interaction, where users engage with customized content within the specific
page. While the majority of research has been focusing on the sequential
recommendation task that improves users' feedback in Stage II, there has been
little investigation on how to achieve better page navigation in Stage I. To
fill this gap, we formally define the task of Personalized Landing Page
Modeling (PLPM) into the field of recommender systems: Given a user upon app
entry, the goal of PLPM is to proactively select the most suitable landing page
from a set of candidates (e.g., functional tabs, content channels, or
aggregation pages) to optimize the short-term PDR metric and the long-term user
engagement and satisfaction metrics, while adhering to industrial constraints.
Additionally, we propose KLAN (Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator), a
hierarchical solution framework designed to provide personalized landing pages
under the formulation of PLPM. KLAN comprises three key components: (1)
KLAN-ISP captures inter-day static page preference; (2) KLAN-IIT captures
intra-day dynamic interest transitions and (3) KLAN-AM adaptively integrates
both components for optimal navigation decisions. Extensive online experiments
conducted on the Kuaishou platform demonstrate the effectiveness of KLAN,
obtaining +0.205% and +0.192% improvements on in Daily Active Users (DAU) and
user Lifetime (LT). Our KLAN is ultimately deployed on the online platform at
full traffic, serving hundreds of millions of users. To promote further
research in this important area, we will release our dataset and code upon
paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAR is a brain aging simulation model based on generative autoregressive transformers. It predicts future brain structure from MRI scans, outperforming existing models in image fidelity and consistency with aging patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to predict the future structural evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain.

Method: NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block via cross-attention.

Result: demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.

Conclusion: NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical

via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and

Motivation: 解决先前研究中关于语言覆盖范围、认知背景和 LLM 参与的粒度的关键差距。

Method: 基于击键的框架，用于检测韩语中 LLM 辅助的作弊行为。该数据集包括 69 名参与者，他们在三种情况下完成了写作任务：真实的写作、释义 ChatGPT 回复和转录 ChatGPT 回复。每个任务跨越了 Bloom 分类法中定义的六个认知过程。提取可解释的时间和节奏特征，并在认知感知和认知非感知设置下评估多个分类器。

Result: 时间特征在认知感知评估场景下表现良好，而节奏特征在跨认知场景下更好地推广。检测真实和转录的回复比释义的回复更容易，对于所提出的模型和人类评估者都是如此，并且模型明显优于人类。

Conclusion: 击键动态有助于可靠地检测在不同认知需求和写作策略（包括释义和转录 LLM 生成的回复）下 LLM 辅助的写作。

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

Conclusion: This research significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Motivation: 心血管疾病 (CVD) 每年在全球造成超过 1700 万人死亡，因此迫切需要保护隐私的预测系统。

Method: 集成了参数模型（逻辑回归、SVM、神经网络）和非参数模型（随机森林、XGBoost）的联邦学习 (FL) 框架 FedCVD++，并提出了树子集抽样、基于 XGBoost 的特征提取和联邦 SMOTE 同步等方法。

Result: 在 Framingham 数据集上，FedCVD++ 实现了最先进的结果：联邦 XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) 超过了其集中式对应物 (F1 = 0.78)，联邦随机森林 (F1 = 0.81) 与非联邦性能相匹配。此外，通信效率高的策略将带宽消耗降低了 3.2 倍，同时保持了 95% 的准确率。

Conclusion: FedCVD++在保护隐私的前提下，实现了优异的冠心病风险预测性能，并在多机构部署中表现出卓越的可扩展性。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GSM-UTCI, a fast and accurate deep learning model for predicting urban heat stress, and demonstrates its use in evaluating greening strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress.

Method: a multimodal deep learning framework

Result: achieves near-physical accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C, while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes.

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI is a scalable tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies.

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在评估人类认知和心理特征的标准测试中取得了显著成果，但这些结果常被误解为 LLM 具备类人特征的有力证据。

Method: 通过论证和分析，指出当前使用人类心理和教育测试评估 LLM 的不合理性。

Result: 论证了将基准测试性能解释为类人特征缺乏足够的理论和实证依据，并呼吁开发专门针对 AI 系统的评估框架。

Conclusion: 停止使用人类测试评估 AI，而是开发有原则的、特定于 AI 的测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究多模态潜在空间在逆向任务中的局限性，发现其在语义和感知上存在缺陷，强调需要进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究任务特定AI模型中多模态潜在空间的反向能力和更广泛的效用。虽然这些模型擅长其设计的前向任务（例如，文本到图像生成，音频到文本转录），但它们在逆向映射方面的潜力仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出一个基于优化的框架，以从期望的输出中推断输入特征，将其双向应用于文本-图像和文本-音频模态。

Result: 实验结果表明，虽然优化可以迫使模型产生在文本上与目标对齐的输出，但这些反演的感知质量是混乱和不连贯的。此外，当尝试从生成模型推断原始语义输入时，重建的潜在空间嵌入通常缺乏语义可解释性，与无意义的词汇标记对齐。

Conclusion: 多模态潜在空间主要针对特定正向任务进行优化，并不具备稳健和可解释的逆映射所需的结构。需要进一步研究开发真正具有语义丰富且可逆的多模态潜在空间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization, resulting in accuracy degradation. Activation outliers hinder effective low-precision WAQ. Offline thresholding leads to performance degradation, while online detection introduces runtime overhead.

Method: propose KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework, featuring an index-based computation scheme and a novel outlier detection engine, Orizuru.

Result: KLLM achieves speedups and energy efficiency improvements compared to A100 GPU and Atom.

Conclusion: KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x and 7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x and 150.21x compared to the A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and interactions between actors significantly shape performance.

Method: integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality to identify correlating links in time series data and Using Group Lasso for lag selection

Result: identify a small but consistently influential set of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly throughput time.

Conclusion: Actor behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly throughput time.

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in critically ill patients is challenging.

Method: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria (creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior sampling.

Result: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation. CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800, specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII.

Conclusion: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely interventions in critical care.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction that generalizes across materials and loading conditions, offering a scalable alternative to simulator-specific workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize. Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance computing resources to explore the input space.

Method: a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of materials, and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and solver settings.

Result: The trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks, including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML.

Conclusion: Fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture, offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical

applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study

Motivation: development of generative models for abstract weighted graph data using deep neural networks

Method: an autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting sparsity

Result: Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: BiGG-E captures distributions over weighted graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

TL;DR: This paper studies the impact of training conditions and input features on the robustness and generalization of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD conditions. The results suggest that noise-aware training improves robustness in some configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD conditions.Prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, such relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models.

Method: benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID and OOD performance.

Result: noise-aware training improves robustness in some configurations

Conclusion: noise-aware training improves robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in speech models.

Motivation: 研究概率分类任务中任意性如何产生，当竞争模型为个体分配冲突预测时，这种现象会破坏可解释性和安全性。

Method: 提出了一种估计概率分类任务中遗憾的通用方法。

Result: 使用我们的度量来表明，数据集中某些组的后悔程度更高，并讨论了后悔的潜在应用。

Conclusion: 通过拒绝和数据收集，估计遗憾可以提高实际应用中的安全性。

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

Motivation: 许多问题都受微分方程 (DE) 支配。人工智能 (AI) 是解决 DE 的一条新途径。然而，数据非常稀缺，现有的 AI 求解器难以逼近高频分量 (AHFC)。

Method: 我们提出了一种用于求解各种 DE 的 AI 范例，包括 DE 统治的第一性原理数据生成方法和尺度扩张算子 (SDO) AI 求解器。我们引入了一种可逆 SDO，它利用多尺度解的傅里叶变换来修复 AHFC，并设计了一种具有 SDO 的 DE 的时空耦合、基于注意力的 Transformer AI 求解器。

Result: 对各种 DE 的大量测试表明，我们的 AI 范例比最先进的方法实现了始终如一的卓越精度。

Conclusion: 该工作使 DE 的 AI 求解器真正可用于广泛的自然和工程领域。

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FuseTen 是一种新的生成框架，它通过融合来自 Sentinel-2、Landsat 8 和 Terra MODIS 的时空观测，生成精细的 10 米空间分辨率的每日 LST 观测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市热浪、干旱和土地退化是气候变化背景下日益严峻的挑战。研究它们的一个有价值的方法需要关于地表状况的准确时空信息。评估和理解这些现象最重要的变量之一是地表温度 (LST)，它来自卫星，并提供关于地球表面热状态的重要信息。

Method: FuseTen 采用生成架构，该架构使用基于物理原理的基于平均的监督策略进行训练。它在融合过程中结合了注意力和归一化模块，并使用 PatchGAN 鉴别器来增强真实感。

Result: FuseTen 优于线性基线，定量指标平均提高 32.06%，视觉保真度平均提高 31.42%。

Conclusion: FuseTen优于线性基线，定量指标平均提高 32.06%，视觉保真度平均提高 31.42%。据我们所知，这是第一个生成如此精细空间分辨率的每日 LST 估计的非线性方法。

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

### [166] [NaN-Propagation: A Novel Method for Sparsity Detection in Black-Box Computational Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23186)
*Peter Sharpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的稀疏性检测方法 NaN 传播，它可以消除假阴性，并在航空航天机翼重量模型上实现了 1.52 倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒函数中的稀疏性检测可以通过 Jacobian 压缩显着提高基于梯度的优化的计算速度，但现有的有限差分方法由于偶然的零梯度而遭受假阴性。这些假阴性会悄无声息地破坏梯度计算，导致难以诊断的错误。

Method: 引入 NaN 传播，它利用 IEEE 754 Not-a-Number 浮点值的通用污染特性，通过浮点数值计算来跟踪输入-输出依赖关系。通过系统地用 NaN 污染输入并观察哪些输出变为 NaN，该方法重建了保守的稀疏模式，消除了假阴性。

Result: 在航空航天机翼重量模型上验证了该方法，实现了 1.52 倍的加速，同时检测到传统方法遗漏的数十个依赖关系——这是一项重大改进，因为梯度计算是许多优化工作流程中的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 该技术利用 IEEE 754 标准的兼容性，无需修改现有的黑盒代码，即可跨编程语言和数学库工作。高级策略包括 NaN 有效载荷编码，可实现快于线性的时间复杂度，优于现有的黑盒稀疏性检测方法。此外，还提出了实用的算法来缓解工程应用中常见的代码分支执行带来的挑战。

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

Conclusion: DocsRay-Pro 在 MMLongBench-Doc 基准测试中达到了 64.7% 的准确率，大大超过了之前的最先进水平。

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 上下文幻觉（即由给定上下文不支持的陈述）仍然是人工智能领域的一个重大挑战。

Method: 通过单个前向传递和对其残差流的线性探测，使用生成器无关的观察者模型来检测幻觉。

Result: 该探针分离出一个单一的、可转移的线性方向，将幻觉文本与忠实文本区分开来，性能优于基线5-27个点，并在Gemma-2模型（2B到27B）中显示出稳健的中间层性能。梯度乘以激活将此信号定位到稀疏的、后期的MLP活动。

Conclusion: 内部的、低维的幻觉跟踪与特定的MLP子电路相关联，可用于检测和缓解。

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于日益增长的隐私问题，机器卸载受到了越来越多的关注。现有的基于影响的卸载方法由于其能够在不重新训练的情况下估计单个训练样本对模型参数的影响而成为一种突出的方法。然而，这种方法存在着巨大的计算开销，这是由于需要计算所有训练样本和参数上的Hessian矩阵及其逆矩阵，使得它对于大型模型和涉及频繁数据删除请求的场景来说是不切实际的。这突出了遗忘的困难。受到认知科学的启发，认知科学表明记忆比遗忘更容易，本文建立了记忆（增量学习）和遗忘（卸载）之间的理论联系。这种联系使得可以从增量学习的角度来解决机器卸载问题。

Method: 本文从增量学习的角度，引入了一种影响近似卸载（IAU）算法，用于高效的机器卸载。

Conclusion: IAU算法在删除保证、卸载效率和可比模型效用之间取得了卓越的平衡，同时在不同的数据集和模型架构上优于最先进的方法。

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

Conclusion: SequenceLayers enables complex models to be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs, and can be implemented in any deep learning library.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers

Conclusion: The paper introduces two novel interpretable-by-design algorithms for forgotten item prediction, demonstrating a 10-15% improvement over state-of-the-art NBP baselines on a real-world retail dataset.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

TL;DR: CostCert是一种新的防御对抗补丁攻击的方法，它比现有技术更好，并且可以扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗补丁攻击是深度学习系统面临的一个问题。现有的认证恢复技术通常在标签之间进行成对比较，无法精确地认证top k预测标签中的唯一真实标签，因为攻击者控制的投票数量膨胀；然而，枚举投票分配的所有组合会遇到组合爆炸问题。

Method: 提出CostCert，一种新颖、可扩展且精确的基于投票的认证恢复防御器。CostCert验证top k预测中样本的真实标签，无需成对比较和组合爆炸，通过一种新颖的设计：攻击者是否无法承担最小的总额外投票数，以将真实标签从top k预测标签中排除。

Result: CostCert显著优于当前最先进的防御器PatchGuard，例如，当patch size为96时，CostCert保持高达57.3%的认证准确率，而PatchGuard已经降至零。

Conclusion: CostCert显著优于当前最先进的防御器PatchGuard，例如，当patch size为96时，CostCert保持高达57.3%的认证准确率，而PatchGuard已经降至零。

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微代理的模拟方法，用于优化自行车共享系统中的动态定价，以平衡自行车库存并降低搬迁成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自行车共享系统中时空变化的用户需求导致自行车站点库存不平衡，从而导致额外的搬迁成本。因此，必须通过最佳动态定价来管理用户需求。

Method: 开发了一种可微的基于代理的模拟方法来快速设计自行车共享系统中的动态定价。

Result: 数值实验表明，与传统方法相比，该方法能够以更快的收敛速度获得更准确的解决方案，损失减少了 73% 到 78%。在涉及 289 个自行车站点的大规模城市自行车共享系统场景中，通过模拟，证实了所获得的定价策略可以自然地诱导平衡的库存，而无需任何人工搬迁。

Conclusion: 通过模拟验证，动态定价策略可以在不需要人工干预的情况下，自然地实现平衡的自行车库存。适当的初始条件可以最大限度地降低折扣成本。

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces causal explanations for concept drift, enhancing the actionability of explanations and enabling targeted interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how changes impact different systems is crucial, and explaining concept drift enables targeted interventions.

Method: Extending model-based drift explanations towards causal explanations.

Result: The framework isolates causally relevant features impacted by concept drift, allowing for targeted intervention.

Conclusion: The explanation strategy was evaluated on use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of the framework.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

TL;DR: PLARE是一种新的离线强化学习方法，它利用大型视觉-语言模型来指导代理训练，避免了手动设计奖励函数的需要，并在机器人操作任务中表现出色。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的离线强化学习算法通常需要奖励标记数据，而奖励函数设计本身成本高昂、劳动密集且需要大量的领域专业知识。因此，本文旨在不依赖手动设计的奖励函数。

Method: PLARE利用大型视觉-语言模型(VLM)为代理训练提供指导信号，通过查询VLM获得视觉轨迹片段对的偏好标签，并使用监督对比偏好学习目标直接从这些偏好标签训练策略。

Result: PLARE在机器人操作任务上达到了与现有VLM奖励生成方法相当或超过的性能，并在真实世界的机器人操作任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PLARE在MetaWorld的机器人操作任务上达到了与现有VLM奖励生成方法相当或超过的性能，并在真实世界的机器人操作任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

Conclusion: dimensionally factorized operator learning具有高效和可推广的PDE建模的优势，并为该方法奠定了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

Conclusion: Coflex在网络准确性和能量延迟乘积方面优于现有方法，同时实现了 1.9 倍到 9.5 倍的计算加速。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from

This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed

interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

Motivation: 实践者在基于因果效应进行决策时，通常会忽略结构不确定性。

Method: 贝叶斯模型平均

Result: 研究表明，当结构不确定性为中度至高度，因果效应在不同结构之间存在显著差异，且损失函数对因果效应的大小足够敏感时，模型平均是有益的。

Conclusion: 这篇论文提出了一个解决结构不确定性的方法，并证明了在一定条件下该方法的最优性。通过模拟实验，验证了现代因果发现方法可以在一定程度上提供必要的量化。

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的集成聚合方法（DEA），该方法自适应地结合Q值估计，以提高连续控制任务中的离策略强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续控制任务中的离策略强化学习主要取决于准确的Q值估计。诸如取最小值之类的保守集成聚合通常用于减轻过高估计偏差。但是，这些静态规则是粗糙的，丢弃了集成中的宝贵信息，并且无法适应特定于任务的需求或不同的学习方式。

Method: 提出了一种方向集成聚合（DEA），这是一种自适应结合actor-critic框架中的Q值估计的聚合方法。DEA引入了两个完全可学习的方向参数：一个调节评论家一方的保守性，另一个指导演员一方的策略探索。这两个参数都是使用集成不一致加权贝尔曼误差学习的，该误差仅按其贝尔曼误差的方向对每个样本进行加权。

Result: 方向学习机制使DEA能够以数据驱动的方式调整保守性和探索，从而使聚合适应不确定性水平和训练阶段。在连续控制基准和学习机制（从交互式到样本高效）中评估了DEA，并证明了其优于静态集成策略的有效性。

Conclusion: DEA在连续控制基准和学习机制（从交互式到样本高效）中进行了评估，并证明了其优于静态集成策略的有效性。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.

Method: The paper proves a Verifier Trade-off Theorem.

Result: Reducing the inherent verification time of a language from f(n) to g(n), where f(n) is greater than or equal to g(n), requires certificates of length at least Omega(log(f(n) / g(n))).

Conclusion: This paper relates the P vs. NP problem to the existence of sub-linear certificates.

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

TL;DR: 本文针对DP-Clipped-SGD，在固定裁剪水平下，提供了首个高概率收敛分析，适用于重尾噪声下的凸和非凸光滑优化，并实现了更快的收敛速度和更好的隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度裁剪是深度学习中的一个基本工具，可以提高随机一阶方法（如SGD、AdaGrad和Adam）在高概率下的收敛性，这些方法在训练大型语言模型中很常见。它也是差分隐私（DP）机制的关键组成部分。然而，现有的高概率收敛分析通常要求裁剪阈值随着优化步骤的数量而增加，这与标准DP机制（如高斯机制）不兼容。

Method: DP-Clipped-SGD，具有固定的裁剪水平

Result: 在高概率下，DP-Clipped-SGD在重尾噪声下，对于凸和非凸光滑优化，都可以收敛到最优解的邻域，且收敛速度比现有算法更快。同时，在收敛速度和隐私保证之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 在固定裁剪水平下，该方法比现有方法更快地收敛到最优解的邻域。邻域可以与DP引入的噪声相平衡，从而在收敛速度和隐私保证之间提供改进的权衡。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) is a problem, and experience replay's effectiveness is limited by the sparse distribution of stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. Introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary (Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting.

Method: The Experience Blending framework integrates knowledge from both stored key samples and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. It consists of a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations, generating SBD, and an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages both stored key samples and SBD.

Result: The Experience Blending method achieves accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, respectively, compared to nine CL baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed Experience Blending method outperforms nine CL baselines on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is

Conclusion: We obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption, for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power

neuromorphic computing, achieving up to 32x reduction in energy consumption.
Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements
observed in certain task settings, reinforcing SpiNNaker2's viability for
real-time neuromorphic control and making the neuromorphic approach a

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets and can be flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently delivering performance improvements.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

*Yu-Tang Chang,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces EB-gMCR, a deep learning approach for signal unmixing that overcomes limitations of traditional methods by automatically discovering the optimal number of components and scaling well to large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges.

Method: reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts from a large candidate pool and employs a differentiable gating network to retain only active components while estimating their concentrations.

Result: On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near exact component estimation.

Conclusion: EB-gMCR offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including chemical library-driven scenarios.

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于学习多智能体消息传递策略层次结构的新方法，该方法在相关基准测试中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分散式多智能体强化学习 (MARL) 方法允许学习可扩展的多智能体策略，但存在部分可观察性和诱导非平稳性问题。这些挑战可以通过引入促进协调和高级规划的机制来解决。具体而言，协调和时间抽象可以通过通信（例如，消息传递）和分层强化学习 (HRL) 方法来实现决策。但是，优化问题限制了分层策略在多智能体系统中的适用性。因此，这些方法的组合尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的有效方法，用于学习多智能体消息传递策略的层次结构。我们采用了封建 HRL 框架，并依赖于分层图结构来实现智能体之间的规划和协调。层级结构中较低层的智能体接收来自较高层的目标，并与同一层级的相邻智能体交换消息。为了学习分层多智能体策略，我们设计了一种新的奖励分配方法，该方法基于训练较低层策略以最大化与较高层相关的优势函数。

Result: 我们设计了一种新的奖励分配方法，该方法基于训练较低层策略以最大化与较高层相关的优势函数。该方法在相关基准测试中表现良好，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在相关基准测试中表现良好，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Conclusion: 该方法可以有效预测给定临床试验中多个地点的患者入组数量，优于已建立的基线模型。

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Conclusion: L-GTA produces more reliable, consistent, and controllable augmented data, leading to significant improvements in predictive accuracy and similarity measures.

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: linear attention is an approximation of softmax attention, and softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: the question of why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts remains unanswered and softmax attention has the quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity

Method: deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention and Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows for the ablation of the components of softmax attention

Result: helps explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts

Conclusion: linear attention is an approximation of softmax attention

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreas segmentation remains a major challenge in abdominal imaging, and the organ is systematically under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical importance.

Method: a semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances

Result: a semi-supervised approach significantly outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63% Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence segmentation.

Conclusion: PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in medical imaging.

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at
