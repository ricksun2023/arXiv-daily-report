### [1] [Noise or Nuance: An Investigation Into Useful Information and Filtering For LLM Driven AKBC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08903)
*Alex Clay,Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz,Pranava Madhyastha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在受限情况下（例如 2025 LM-KBC 挑战赛）改进 LLM 输出质量的三种方法：生成、质量保证和 LLM 响应解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在像 2025 LM-KBC 挑战赛这样的受限环境中，检索增强生成 (RAG) 和微调等技术受到限制。

Method: 研究了 triple completion 任务的三个方面：生成、质量保证和 LLM 响应解析。

Result: 发现在这种受限环境中：额外的信息可以提高生成质量，LLM 可以有效地过滤低质量的三元组，并且 LLM 响应解析的灵活性和一致性之间的权衡取决于具体设置。

Conclusion: 在受限环境中，额外信息能提升生成质量，LLM 可有效过滤低质三元组，LLM 响应解析的灵活性和一致性的权衡取决于具体设置。

Abstract: RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM
outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC
challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three
facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM
response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional
information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering
poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with
LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

### [2] [Automated Evidence Extraction and Scoring for Corporate Climate Policy Engagement: A Multilingual RAG Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08907)
*Imene Kolli,Ario Saeid Vaghefi,Chiara Colesanti Senni,Shantam Raj,Markus Leippold*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors climate policy engagement of companies and industry associations. They propose an AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error.

Method: leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data. a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies

Result: the automated RAG system effectively accelerates evidence extraction

Conclusion: the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces, expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of
over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's
support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris
Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although
InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical
workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it
time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an
AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy
engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most
time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data.
Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic
embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates
evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a
human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces,
expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

### [3] [Documents Are People and Words Are Items: A Psychometric Approach to Textual Data with Contextual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08920)
*Jinsong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的心理测量方法，用于使用大型语言模型分析文本数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用上下文嵌入创建上下文分数，将文本数据转换为适合心理测量分析的响应数据。假设某些关键词的上下文含义在不同文档中差异很大，可以有效地区分语料库中的文档。

Method: 该建模过程包括两个阶段：获取上下文分数和执行心理测量分析。在第一阶段，我们利用自然语言处理技术和基于编码器的transformer模型来识别常见的关键词并生成上下文分数。在第二阶段，我们采用各种类型的因子分析，包括探索性和双因子模型，以提取和定义潜在因子，确定因子相关性，并识别与每个因子相关的最重要词语。

Result: 应用于Wiki STEM语料库的实验结果表明，该方法具有发现文本数据中潜在知识维度和模式的潜力。

Conclusion: 这种方法不仅增强了文本数据的心理测量分析，而且在教育、心理学和法律等富含文本信息的领域具有应用前景。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual
data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create
contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for
psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items,
this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the
assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly
across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The
modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and
performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural
language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify
common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ
various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to
extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify
the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki
STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to
uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This
approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also
holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as
education, psychology, and law.

### [4] [BRoverbs -- Measuring how much LLMs understand Portuguese proverbs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08960)
*Thales Sales Almeida,Giovana Kerche Bonás,João Guilherme Alves Santos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的葡萄牙语LLM评估数据集BRoverbs，它利用巴西谚语来评估模型对区域表达的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有葡萄牙语评估数据集有限，无法完全捕捉语言细微差别或文化参考。现有的数据集主要关注结构化的国家考试或社交媒体互动的情感分析，在评估更广泛的语言理解方面存在差距。

Method: 本文构建了一个名为BRoverbs的数据集，该数据集专门用于通过巴西谚语评估LLM的性能。谚语是一种丰富的语言资源，包含文化智慧、比喻表达和复杂的句法结构。

Result: BRoverbs旨在为葡萄牙语LLM提供一种新的评估工具，为推进区域信息基准做出贡献。

Conclusion: 本文构建了一个新的葡萄牙语LLM评估数据集BRoverbs，以评估模型对区域表达的理解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations
depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied.
This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can
assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of
Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated
datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references.
Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on
structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions,
leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this
limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess
LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic
resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex
syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional
expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for
Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed
benchmarking. The benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tropic-AI/BRoverbs.

### [5] [Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013)
*Monjoy Narayan Choudhury,Junling Wang,Yifan Hou,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型(VLM)在视觉理解和基于语言的推理方面表现出色，但在需要整合感知和符号计算的任务中表现不佳。本文通过视觉方程求解研究了这种局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在整合感知和符号计算任务中的局限性，具体体现在视觉方程求解任务上。视觉方程求解任务中，数学方程式嵌入在图像中，变量由对象图标表示，系数必须通过计数来推断。

Method: 将任务分解为系数计数和变量识别，以确定视觉语言模型在视觉方程求解中的瓶颈。

Result: 发现计数是主要的瓶颈，即使识别是准确的。此外，识别和推理的结合会引入额外的错误，并且随着方程复杂性的增加，符号推理本身也成为一个限制因素。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前视觉语言模型的关键弱点，并指出了未来在视觉基础数学推理方面的改进方向。

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

### [6] [Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE): Evaluating an LLM's Willingness to Re-engage in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09043)
*Thomas Manuel Rost,Martina Figlia,Bernd Wallraff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE: a diagnostic signal for LLM re-engagement willingness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate LLM's willingness to re-engage with users based on interaction transcripts.

Method: Test four chat models across different tones and framing conditions using a YES/NO question (SPICE).

Result: SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone: friendly (97.5% YES), abusive (17.9% YES), unclear (60.4% YES). It also provides a distinct signal from abuse classification.

Conclusion: SPICE is a robust, low-overhead tool for auditing model dispositions, offering a direct signal of a model's state.

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued
Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large
Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a
user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone
(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four
open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480
trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.
Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%
YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue
(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This
core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical
tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse
classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still
overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the
time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a
preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under
ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text
rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,
low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,
complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a
model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support
replication.

### [7] [Improving LLM Safety and Helpfulness using SFT and DPO: A Study on OPT-350M](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09055)
*Piyush Pant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究对齐技术（SFT、DPO 和 SFT+DPO 组合）在提高 OPT-350M 语言模型的安全性和帮助性方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过有监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO）等对齐技术来提升语言模型的安全性和帮助性。

Method: 使用 Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF 数据集训练和评估四个模型：基础 OPT350M 模型、SFT 模型、DPO 模型以及 SFT+DPO 模型。引入三个关键评估指标：危害率（HmR）、帮助率（HpR）和综合对齐分数（CAS）。

Result: SFT 优于 DPO，但 SFT+DPO 模型在所有指标上均优于其他模型，证明了这些技术的互补性。研究结果还强调了噪声数据、有限的 GPU 资源和训练约束带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 研究全面展示了微调策略如何影响模型对齐，并为未来更强大的对齐流程奠定了基础。

Abstract: This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a
combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the
OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset,
we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,
and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation
metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined
Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show
that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all
others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these
techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited
GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view
of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation
for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

### [8] [MR-UIE: Multi-Perspective Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning for Universal Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09082)
*Zhongqiu Li,Shiquan Wang,Ruiyu Fang,Mengjiao Bao,Zhenhe Wu,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li,Zhongjiang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究旨在提高大型语言模型（LLMs）在通用信息抽取（UIE）任务中的性能，特别是在处理复杂模式描述和需要多步骤推理的结构化输出场景时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在通过上下文学习和指令调整来增强LLM的性能方面存在局限性。为了增强模型的泛化能力。

Method: 我们提出将强化学习（RL）与多角度推理相结合，用于信息抽取（IE）任务。我们的工作将LLM从被动提取器转变为主动推理器，使他们不仅能够理解提取什么，还能够理解如何推理。

Result: 在多个IE基准上进行的实验表明，MR-UIE在各个领域都持续提高提取准确率，并在多个数据集上超越了最先进的方法。此外，将多角度推理纳入RL显著提高了复杂IE任务的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多角度推理在具有挑战性的场景中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse
research domains. However, their performance in universal information
extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured
output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require
multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs
through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations
nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for
information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive
extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to
extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks
demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across
domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances
generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning
in challenging scenarios.

### [9] [TigerCoder: A Novel Suite of LLMs for Code Generation in Bangla](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09101)
*Nishat Raihan,Antonios Anastasopoulos,Marcos Zampieri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 孟加拉语在大型语言模型中代表性不足，尤其是在代码生成方面。本文介绍了第一个专门用于孟加拉语的代码LLM系列（1B和9B）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为第五大最常用语言，在大型语言模型（LLM）中仍然代表性不足，特别是在代码生成方面。这主要是由于缺乏高质量的数据来预训练和/或微调这些模型。

Method: 本文贡献包括：(1) 用于编程领域适应的综合性孟加拉语代码指令数据集；(2) MBPP-Bangla，一个用于孟加拉语代码生成的评估基准；(3) TigerCoder系列代码LLM。

Result: TigerCoder系列代码LLM在Pass@1上的性能比现有的多语言和通用孟加拉语LLM有了显著提高，约为11-18%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，精心策划的高质量数据集可以克服小型模型在低资源语言方面的局限性。所有资源都已开源，以进一步推进孟加拉语LLM的研究。

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented
in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This
primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or
finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code
LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a
comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain
adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code
generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant
~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and
general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality
datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages.
We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

### [10] [Compass-v3: Scaling Domain-Specific LLMs for Multilingual E-Commerce in Southeast Asia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09121)
*Sophia Maria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compass-v3 is a 245B parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce, outperforming other models and widely used in Shopee.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with specialized tasks like e-commerce due to noisy, heterogeneous, multilingual, and dynamic data.

Method: It uses fewer but larger experts, hardware-efficient optimizations, mixed-training strategy on 12T tokens, and Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO).

Result: Compass-v3 achieves state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1, GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B, with strong multilingual capabilities.

Conclusion: Compass-v3 demonstrates both specialized commerce expertise and broad linguistic competence, now accounting for over 70% of total LLM usage in Shopee's platform.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their
performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific
knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy,
heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a
vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and
71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3
adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient
optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy
operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of
curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions
using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose
Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures
token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in
commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3
delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1,
GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong
multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages
(Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while
sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been
widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is
gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM
usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and
broad linguistic competence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在减少传统手动编码对话行为所需的时间和精力。

Method: 使用定制的提示测试了 GPT-3.5-turbo 和 GPT-4 模型，使用 CIMA 语料库。

Result: GPT-4 达到了 80% 的准确率，加权 F1 分数为 0.81，Cohen's Kappa 为 0.74，超过了基线性能，表明与人工注释基本一致。

Conclusion: 生成式人工智能在提供高效且可访问的对话行为分类方法方面具有强大的潜力，对教育对话分析具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the
classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and
effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the
open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four
DA categories. Both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models were tested using tailored
prompts. Results show that GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, a weighted F1-score of
0.81, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, surpassing baseline performance and
indicating substantial agreement with human annotations. These findings suggest
that generative AI has strong potential to provide an efficient and accessible
approach to DA classification, with meaningful implications for educational
dialogue analysis. The study also highlights the importance of task-specific
label definitions and contextual information in enhancing the quality of
automated annotation. Finally, it underscores the ethical considerations
associated with the use of generative AI and the need for responsible and
transparent research practices. The script of this research is publicly

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ViRanker is a cross-encoder reranking model for Vietnamese, built on BGE-M3 and Blockwise Parallel Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of effective rerankers for Vietnamese due to it being a low-resource language with complex syntax.

Method: Trained on an 8GB corpus and fine-tuned with hybrid hard-negative sampling.

Result: Achieves strong early-rank accuracy on MMARCO-VI, surpassing multilingual baselines and competing with PhoRanker.

Conclusion: Demonstrates how architectural adaptation and data curation can improve reranking for underrepresented languages and is released on Hugging Face to encourage adoption and reproducibility.

Abstract: This paper presents ViRanker, a cross-encoder reranking model tailored to the
Vietnamese language. Built on the BGE-M3 encoder and enhanced with the
Blockwise Parallel Transformer, ViRanker addresses the lack of competitive
rerankers for Vietnamese, a low-resource language with complex syntax and
diacritics. The model was trained on an 8 GB curated corpus and fine-tuned with
hybrid hard-negative sampling to strengthen robustness. Evaluated on the
MMARCO-VI benchmark, ViRanker achieves strong early-rank accuracy, surpassing
multilingual baselines and competing closely with PhoRanker. By releasing the
model openly on Hugging Face, we aim to support reproducibility and encourage
wider adoption in real-world retrieval systems. Beyond Vietnamese, this study
illustrates how careful architectural adaptation and data curation can advance
reranking in other underrepresented languages.

*Taha Binhuraib,Ruimin Gao,Anna A. Ivanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LITcoder is an open-source library that simplifies building and benchmarking neural encoding models for brain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a flexible backend with standardized tools for aligning stimuli with brain data, transforming stimuli into features, mapping features onto brain data, and evaluating model performance.

Method: Implements a modular pipeline with various methodological choices for composing, comparing, and extending encoding models. Includes options for brain datasets, regions, stimulus features, downsampling, and integrates with experiment tracking platforms.

Result: Demonstrates scalability and versatility by fitting encoding models to story listening datasets and explores methodological choices for continuous fMRI data, highlighting the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR scan, hemodynamic lag effects, train-test splits, and head motion effects.

Conclusion: LITcoder lowers technical barriers, facilitates comparisons, fosters rigor, and accelerates the development of predictive models of brain activity.

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking
neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides
standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with
brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those
features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the
resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline
covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can
easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core
infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus
feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling
approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in
logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms
such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility
of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening
datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore
the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous
fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR
scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),
incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize
information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model
predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model
implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,
fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality
high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

### [14] [Target-oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification with Counterfactual-enhanced Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09160)
*Zhiyue Liu,Fanrong Ma,Xin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的反事实增强去偏框架，以减少目标导向的多模态情感分类中由文本内容过度依赖和数据集偏差引起的虚假相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过度依赖文本内容，忽略了数据集偏差，特别是词语层面的上下文偏差，导致文本特征和输出标签之间存在虚假相关性，从而降低了分类准确性。

Method: 该框架包含一种反事实数据增强策略，可以最小程度地改变情感相关的因果特征，生成细节匹配的图像-文本样本，以引导模型关注与情感相关的内容。此外，为了从反事实数据中学习稳健的特征并提示模型决策，引入了一种自适应去偏对比学习机制，有效地减轻了有偏词语的影响。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过反事实增强去偏框架，有效地减少了目标导向的多模态情感分类中的虚假相关性，提高了分类准确性。

Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict
sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大语言模型由于训练范式未能弥合特征表示空间中的声学-语义差距，导致知识和推理能力下降。

Method: 本文提出EchoX，它利用语义表示并动态生成语音训练目标，整合声学和语义学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，经过约6000小时的训练数据，EchoX在多个基于知识的问答基准测试中取得了先进的性能。

Conclusion: EchoX通过整合声学和语义学习，成功地保留了语音大语言模型的强大推理能力。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing
attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often
exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize
that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail
to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To
address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations
and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates
both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong
reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced
performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks. The
project is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/EchoX.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种改进ASR模型识别罕见词的方法，通过预测多个步骤来避免撤销奖励，从而提高效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR模型在识别罕见词时存在问题，Trie-based biasing方法计算成本高。

Method: 通过调整ASR模型，使其能够向前看并一次预测多个步骤，从而避免撤销步骤。

Result: 使用10小时的合成数据对Whisper进行微调后，在NSC Part 2测试集上的词错误率从30.86%降低到12.19%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效降低ASR模型识别罕见词的错误率。

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by
prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is
Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g.
"Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the
full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those
earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is
computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To
overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and
predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by
better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of
the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic
data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from
30.86% to 12.19%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的上下文偏置方法，以提高语音识别模型对罕见词的识别能力。通过在训练偏置模块时引入关键词感知损失函数，减少了合成数据可能导致的过拟合问题。实验结果表明，该方法显著降低了词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文偏置方法在训练偏置模块时，使用合成的罕见词数据容易过拟合。为了解决这个问题。

Method: 该论文改进了基于TCPGen的上下文偏置方法，并提出了一个关键词感知的损失函数，该函数包含一个用于偏置词预测的掩码交叉熵项和一个用于检测偏置词位置的二元分类项。

Result: 通过将Whisper模型适配到10小时的合成数据上，该方法在NSC Part 2测试集上的词错误率从29.71%降低到11.81%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法能够有效地提高语音识别模型对罕见词的识别能力，并减少合成数据带来的过拟合问题。

Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic
data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through
contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model
architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic
rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to
overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we
enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a
keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when
training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for
biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased
word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased
words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our
method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to
11.81%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究棉耳绒猴的叫声交流为了将其与大脑活动联系起来，因为人类语音和语言研究很难进入大脑。

Method: 设计了一种新的零样本评估指标，使用无监督的野外数据和弱标记的对话数据来评估 GmSLM。

Result: GmSLM 生成的叫声在声学上与真实的重采样样本非常匹配，并且在下游任务中表现良好。它能够区分真实对话和人工对话。

Conclusion: GmSLM 可以支持进一步研究声音交流的神经基础，并提供了一个连接发声和大脑活动的实用框架。

Abstract: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view
that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar
features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking.
Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with
brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in
speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through
vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We
introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized
spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a
novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data,
alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate
its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated
vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and
performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM
effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support
further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides
a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM
stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary
biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种上下文压缩框架（CCF），旨在通过学习分层潜在表示来减少输入冗余，从而实现高效的长上下文建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展语言模型的上下文对于捕获扩展语篇中的丰富依赖关系至关重要。然而，简单的上下文扩展会带来巨大的计算和内存负担，导致训练和推理效率低下。

Method: CCF集成了分段语义聚合与键值记忆编码，形成紧凑的表示，支持精确的重建和远程理解。此外，还引入了一种训练高效的优化策略，将增量段解码与稀疏储层采样相结合，从而在不降低性能的情况下显著降低内存开销。

Result: 在多个长上下文语言建模基准测试中的经验结果表明，CCF在高压缩比下实现了有竞争力的困惑度，并且与现有方法相比，显著提高了吞吐量和内存效率。

Conclusion: 结构化压缩具有实现可扩展和有效的长上下文语言建模的潜力。

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich
dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension
imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in
inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose
CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient
long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that
preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF
integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding,
forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and
long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a
training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment
decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead
without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context
language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive
perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput
and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight
the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context
language modeling.

Abstract: Accurately assessing candidate seniority from resumes is a critical yet
challenging task, complicated by the prevalence of overstated experience and
ambiguous self-presentation. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of
large language models (LLMs), including fine-tuned BERT architectures, for
automating seniority classification in resumes. To rigorously evaluate model
performance, we introduce a hybrid dataset comprising both real-world resumes

qualifications and understated seniority. Using the dataset, we evaluate the
performance of Large Language Models in detecting subtle linguistic cues
associated with seniority inflation and implicit expertise. Our findings
highlight promising directions for enhancing AI-driven candidate evaluation

Motivation: 现有专利到SDG分类方法缺乏可扩展性和通用性，且缺乏大型标注数据集。

Method: 该论文提出了一种基于弱监督的专利到SDG分类方法，使用专利引用的SDG标签科学出版物作为噪声初始信号，并利用大型语言模型提取专利和SDG论文中的功能、解决方案和应用等结构化概念，构建复合标签函数。通过自定义的正向损失校准标签函数，生成银标准软多标签数据集。

Result: 该方法在内部验证和外部验证中均表现良好，优于传统技术分类和其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 弱监督和语义对齐可以大规模提高SDG分类效果。

Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot
LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,
co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

*Channdeth Sok,David Luz,Yacine Haddam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaRAG: A metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection approaches do not address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence.

Method: MetaRAG operates in a real-time, unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor access to model internals, and includes four stages: decompose answers into atomic factoids, generate controlled mutations, verify each variant against the retrieved context, and aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a response-level hallucination score.

Result: Experiments on a proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents.

Conclusion: MetaRAG framework effectively detects hallucinations in RAG systems, enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents, and can be used for identity-aware safeguards.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,
confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,
such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not
address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore
present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,
unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor
access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes
domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into
atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using
synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the
retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms
contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a
response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG
localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,
pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),
allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure
thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a
proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for
detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based
conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that
translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this
design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

Motivation: 从认知角度看待自然语言处理中的类比推理过程，优化文本中的关系理解。

Result: 将这些概念与自然语言处理中的概念联系起来，并展示了它们与自然语言处理研究中的几个主要挑战的相关性。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is an essential aspect of human cognition. In this
paper, we summarize key theory about the processes underlying analogical
reasoning from the cognitive science literature and relate it to current
research in natural language processing. While these processes can be easily
linked to concepts in NLP, they are generally not viewed through a cognitive
lens. Furthermore, we show how these notions are relevant for several major
challenges in NLP research, not directly related to analogy solving. This may
guide researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text, as
opposed to relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

Conclusion: 分层括号编码可以在减少标签空间的同时保留结构信息，并在依赖图解析中实现有竞争力的结果。

Abstract: We revisit hierarchical bracketing encodings from a practical perspective in
the context of dependency graph parsing. The approach encodes graphs as
sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with $n$ tagging actions, and still
representing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. Compared to existing graph
linearizations, this representation substantially reduces the label space while
preserving structural information. We evaluate it on a multilingual and

improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

Motivation: 现有方法要么计算开销大，要么校准效果差，使其在现实世界的部署中不切实际且不可靠。

Method: 模型通过最后一个隐藏状态与附加到词汇表的特殊token的嵌入之间的相似性来表达置信度，并对模型进行微调，以校准与准确性相关的校准目标的置信度。

Result: GrACE在开放式生成任务中实现了最佳的判别能力和校准，优于六种竞争方法，且无需额外的抽样或辅助模型。此外，使用GrACE不仅提高了最终决策的准确性，而且显著减少了测试时间缩放方案中所需的样本数量。

Conclusion: GrACE有潜力成为部署具有可扩展、可靠和实时置信度估计的llm的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence
elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications,
such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive
computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical
and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a
Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and
reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in
which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden
state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in
real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with
calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and
two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the
best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,
outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or
an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time
scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that
using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also
significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling
scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying
LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

Motivation: 在简历推荐系统中，职位匹配是一个关键挑战，但重叠术语通常有限或具有误导性。以往的研究主要关注总体性能，忽略了对不同语义相关性区域的细粒度分析。

Method: 提出了一种自监督混合架构，结合密集句子嵌入和领域知识图谱(KG)，并通过图神经网络进行KG集成。采用分层评估方法，将STR得分划分为低、中、高三个区域，以进行细粒度的模型性能分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，经过微调的SBERT模型与KG结合，在高STR区域产生了持续的改进，RMSE比强基线降低了25%。

Conclusion: 结合KG与文本嵌入可以提高模型性能，并且区域性能分析对于理解模型行为至关重要。这种细粒度的方法揭示了全局指标隐藏的优势和劣势，并支持在人力资源系统中进行更有针对性的模型选择。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.

Abstract: This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition

language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label
distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we
evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we
show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations
(perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft
labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are
promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the
perspectivist community.

*Brittany Harbison,Samuel Taubman,Travis Taylor,Ashok. K. Goel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAMI通过促进学生之间的联系来提供一种解决方案，但其有效性受到不完整的心理理论的限制，从而限制了其创建有效的学生心理模型的能力。我们利用GPT的零样本能力，从论坛介绍帖子中推断出五大人格特质，从而提出了一种人格检测模型。我们针对已建立的模型对它的性能进行了基准测试，证明了它在这项任务中的有效性。此外，我们将此模型集成到SAMI的基于实体的匹配系统中，从而实现了知情的人格化社交推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线课程环境给社交群体的自然形成带来了障碍。为了探索这个问题，我们提出了一个人格检测模型。

Method: 利用GPT的零样本能力，从论坛介绍帖子中推断出五大人格特质，并将其集成到SAMI的基于实体的匹配系统中。

Result: 我们针对已建立的模型对它的性能进行了基准测试，证明了它在这项任务中的有效性。初始集成表明，人格特质可以补充现有的匹配因素。

Conclusion: 人格特质可以补充现有的匹配因素，虽然还需要额外的评估来确定它们对学生参与度和匹配质量的全部影响。

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments
present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one
solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is
constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an
effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to
intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs
zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum
introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its
performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this
task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking
system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial
integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching
factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full
impact on student engagement and match quality.

### [32] [Recurrence Meets Transformers for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08897)
*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReT-2: A unified retrieval model for multimodal queries and documents, outperforming existing methods with faster inference and reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multimodal retrieval are task-specific, limited to single-modality queries/documents, and struggle with increasingly complex tasks.

Method: ReT-2 uses multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating to integrate information across layers and modalities.

Result: ReT-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks, with faster inference and reduced memory usage. It also improves downstream performance in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines.

Conclusion: ReT-2 is a unified and efficient solution for multimodal retrieval, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用视觉扩散模型（VDM）生成特征并通过Transformer聚合的方法，以实现人类水平的动作识别，从而应对跨物种、视角和上下文的泛化挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型在跨物种、视角和上下文的动作识别泛化方面表现不佳，而人类可以轻松识别。

Method: 使用视觉扩散模型（VDM）生成特征，并通过Transformer进行聚合。利用扩散过程的早期时间步长来突出语义信息，而非像素级别的细节。

Result: 在跨动物种类、不同视角和不同记录环境的动作分类中，模型在三个泛化基准上都达到了新的state-of-the-art。

Conclusion: 该模型使机器动作识别更接近人类的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptGuard is a modular prompting framework that prevents LLMs from generating harmful information, especially for vulnerable populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs pose risks of generating harmful information to vulnerable populations, and existing safety approaches are insufficient.

Method: A novel modular prompting framework with VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique using contrastive learning, few-shot examples, ethical reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting.

Result: Demonstrates 25-30% analytical harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality with theoretical multi-objective optimization.

Conclusion: Introduces PromptGuard, an intelligent expert system for real-time harm prevention, with mathematical formalization and validation framework.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

### [35] [Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926)
*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的解决Re-ID中标注噪声问题的方法，通过将Re-ID视为图像相似性任务，并采用Siamese网络架构和新颖的基于Beta混合模型的离群点检测框架Beta-SOD来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Re-ID方法对标注噪声非常敏感，导致性能显著下降。本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 本文将Re-ID重新定义为监督图像相似性任务，采用Siamese网络架构，并提出了一个名为Beta-SOD的离群点检测框架，该框架使用双分量Beta分布混合模型来建模嵌入对之间的余弦相似度分布。此外，还结合了二元交叉熵、对比损失和余弦嵌入损失来共同优化特征级别的相似性学习。

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，Beta-SOD在去噪和Re-ID任务中表现出有效性。与其他方法相比，该方法在各种噪声水平下均表现出卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Beta-SOD方法在噪声Re-ID场景中表现出鲁棒性和广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SFD-Mamba2Net的端到端框架，用于ICA血管分割和狭窄检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割和检测方法难以应用于低对比度、高噪声和复杂血管结构的ICA图像。

Method: 在编码器中嵌入曲率感知结构增强（CASE）模块，利用多尺度响应突出血管结构；在解码器中引入渐进式高频感知（PHFP）模块，采用多层次小波分解逐步细化高频细节。

Result: SFD-Mamba2Net在八个分割指标上均优于现有方法，并在狭窄检测中实现了最高的真正率和阳性预测值。

Conclusion: SFD-Mamba2Net在ICA图像的血管分割和狭窄检测方面表现出色。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种全自动框架，用于预测结直肠肝转移 (CRLM) 的手术结果，该框架优于现有的临床和基因组生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预后模型预测能力不足，尤其是在多灶性 CRLM 病例中。

Method: 该框架包括一个分割管线和一个放射组学管线。分割管线学习从部分注释的数据中分割肝脏、肿瘤和脾脏，利用可提示的基础模型来完成缺失的标签。此外，我们提出了一种新的零样本 3D 提示传播算法 SAMONAI，该算法利用 Segment Anything 模型从单个点提示中分割 3D 感兴趣区域，显着提高了我们的分割管线的准确性和效率。然后将预测的对比前和对比后分割结果输入到我们的放射组学管线中，该管线从每个肿瘤中提取特征，并使用 SurvAMINN（一种基于自动编码器的新型多实例神经网络，用于生存分析）预测生存率。

Result: 在包含 227 名患者的机构数据集上进行的大量评估表明，我们的框架超越了现有的临床和基因组生物标志物，C-index 提高了 10% 以上。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，整合自动分割算法和基于放射组学的生存分析具有潜力，可以在 CRLM 中提供准确、注释高效且可解释的结果预测。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同生成模型在视觉属性上的差异以及促成这些差异的提示类型。

Method: 提出了一种名为 CompCon 的进化搜索算法，用于发现一个模型的输出中比另一个模型更普遍的视觉属性，并揭示与这些视觉差异相关的提示概念。

Result: 创建了一个自动数据生成管道，生成了一个包含 60 个输入相关差异的数据集 ID2，并将 CompCon 与几个基于 LLM 和 VLM 的基线方法进行了比较。发现 PixArt 模型倾向于用潮湿的街道描绘与孤独相关的提示，而 Stable Diffusion 3.5 模型在媒体行业中描绘非裔美国人。

Conclusion: CompCon 能够有效地发现不同文本到图像模型之间的视觉表示差异，并揭示相关的提示概念。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的机器学习方法，用于识别和提取无人机图像中的云影和太阳耀斑区域，并将这些区域与无遮挡的晴空区域和未受太阳耀斑影响的区域分开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机系统（UAS）的使用在本十年内迅速增加。它们显著促进了遥感技术的发展，能够根据各种遥感应用所需的空间、光谱、时间及辐射分辨率来部署和成像地形。但无人机影像经常受到云影和太阳耀斑的影响，这对从无人机图像中估计水质参数构成了严重问题。

Method: 本研究提出了一种新的机器学习方法，首先识别和提取具有云影和太阳耀斑的区域，并将这些区域与未受阻碍的晴空区域和未受太阳耀斑影响的区域分开。从像素级的图像中提取数据，以训练基于U-Net的深度学习模型，并基于测试用例中的各种评估指标确定模型训练的最佳设置。

Result: 利用该评估，确定了一个高质量的图像校正模型，该模型用于恢复图像中的云影和太阳耀斑区域。

Conclusion: 确定了一个高质量的图像校正模型，该模型用于恢复图像中的云影和太阳耀斑区域

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin通过结合局部卷积特征学习增强了分层移位窗口注意力，从而改进了ViT在小数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers (ViTs) 虽然在计算机视觉中取得了显著成果，但由于缺乏局部性和平移等变性等关键归纳偏置，它们对全局上下文的强调通常以牺牲小数据集中的局部特征提取为代价。

Method: CoSwin将可学习的局部特征增强模块集成到每个注意力块中，使模型能够同时捕获细粒度的空间细节和全局语义结构。

Result: CoSwin在多个图像分类基准测试中取得了优于最先进的卷积和基于Transformer的模型的性能提升。在CIFAR-10上提高了2.17%，在CIFAR-100上提高了4.92%，在MNIST上提高了0.10%，在SVHN上提高了0.26%，在Tiny ImageNet上提高了4.47%。

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合可以增强transformers在小规模视觉中的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

TL;DR: iMatcher是一个用于点云配准中特征匹配的全可微框架，它利用学习到的特征来预测几何一致的置信度矩阵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云配准方法在处理噪声、遮挡和密度变化等问题时面临挑战。iMatcher旨在提高点云配准的鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: iMatcher通过局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵，并通过双边最近邻搜索进行优化。然后，通过全局几何一致性学习来预测点对之间的匹配概率。

Result: iMatcher在KITTI、KITTI-360和3DMatch等多个数据集上取得了最先进的内点率，分别达到95%-97%、94%-97%和81.1%。

Conclusion: iMatcher显著提高了刚性配准性能，并在各种场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

Method: 提出了一种基于 occupancy 的表示方法 UltrON，它利用声学特征来改善几何一致性，并提出了一个新的损失函数来补偿 B 超图像中的视角依赖性，从而促进多视角超声的 occupancy 优化。

Conclusion: UltrON 缓解了遮挡和稀疏标记的限制，并为更精确的 3D 重建铺平了道路。

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$

Motivation: 现有的 UniDA 方法如 MLNet 对所有分类器同等对待，稀释了学习信号。本文旨在解决这个问题。

Method: E-MLNet 整合了一种动态加权策略到 OEM 中，利用闭集分类器的预测来关注每个目标样本最相关的类别边界。

Result: 在 Office-31、Office-Home、VisDA-2017 和 ImageCLEF 四个基准数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明 E-MLNet 在 VisDA 和 ImageCLEF 上实现了最高的平均 H-scores，并且比其前身具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: E-MLNet 在大多数个体适应任务中优于强大的 MLNet 基线，证实了本文提出的集中适应策略的优势。

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

### [45] [COCO-Urdu: A Large-Scale Urdu Image-Caption Dataset with Multimodal Quality Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09014)
*Umair Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了COCO-Urdu，一个大型乌尔都语图像描述数据集，旨在解决多模态和视觉语言研究中乌尔都语资源不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言视觉语言模型主要在高资源语言上训练，对乌尔都语支持不足，缺乏高质量的大规模乌尔都语数据集。

Method: 从MS COCO数据集中选取59,000张图像，使用SeamlessM4T v2翻译成乌尔都语，并通过结合COMET-Kiwi、CLIP和BERTScore的混合多模态质量评估框架进行验证和迭代优化。

Result: COCO-Urdu是目前最大的公开乌尔都语图像描述数据集，并在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF等指标上取得了良好结果。

Conclusion: 发布COCO-Urdu数据集和质量评估流程旨在减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，并为包容性的视觉语言系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有fMRI视觉解码方法依赖于特定对象的训练，限制了可扩展性和实际部署。

Method: 集成了Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) 用于高效的voxel压缩，以及一个query-driven Q-Former，它产生与CLIP图像嵌入空间对齐的固定大小的神经表示。

Result: 在7T Natural Scenes Dataset上进行评估，VoxelFormer在训练期间包含的受试者上实现了具有竞争力的检索性能，且参数明显少于现有方法。

Conclusion: Token合并和基于查询的Transformer是用于参数高效神经解码的有前途的策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

*Binxu Li,Wei Peng,Mingjie Li,Ehsan Adeli,Kilian M. Pohl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为概率因果图模型 (PCGM) 的新方法，用于生成高质量反事实脑部 MRI 图像，该方法通过概率图模块捕获解剖约束，并将其转换为空间二值掩码，从而在生成过程中保留细微的解剖细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实模型难以生成解剖学上合理的 MRI 图像，因为缺乏明确的归纳偏置来保留细粒度的解剖细节，并且模型训练的目标是优化图像的整体外观，而不是保留受试者之间细微但医学相关的局部变异。

Method: 该方法将解剖约束作为先验显式地整合到生成扩散框架中。PCGM 通过概率图模块捕获解剖约束，并将其转换为空间二值掩码，掩码通过 ControlNet 的 3D 扩展进行编码，约束反事实去噪 UNet，其编码通过 3D 扩散解码器转换为高质量的脑部 MRI。

Result: 在多个数据集上的大量实验表明，PCGM 生成的结构性脑部 MRI 图像质量高于几种基线方法。从 PCGM 生成的反事实图像中提取的脑部测量结果，可以重现在神经科学文献中先前报道的疾病对皮质脑区域的细微影响。

Conclusion: PCGM 的成果是合成 MRI 在研究细微形态差异方面应用的重要里程碑。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated
content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D
medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,

Motivation: 现有的图卷积神经网络在人体行为识别领域表现出色，但在检测人与物体交互行为时效果不佳，因为缺乏对场景信息的有效表示和合适的学习架构。

Method: 本文提出了一种多任务学习方法，该方法利用环境中的固定物体信息来提高人体行为识别性能。为了评估该方法，作者收集了来自公共环境的真实数据，并构建了一个数据集，其中包含与固定物体交互的类别（例如，ATM 售票机、登记/退房机等）以及步行和站立等非交互类别。

Result: 该多任务学习方法结合交互区域信息，成功识别了所研究的交互和非交互行为，准确率达到 99.25%，比仅使用人体骨骼姿势的基础模型提高了 2.75%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够有效地提高对人与物体交互行为的识别准确率。

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于跨模态特征对比和筛选策略的特征融合框架IRDFusion，用于多光谱目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多光谱目标检测方法在特征融合过程中通常会保留多余的背景或噪声，限制了感知性能。

Method: 提出了互特征细化模块(MFRM)和差分特征反馈模块(DFFM)。MFRM通过建模模态内和模态间的关系来增强特征表示，DFFM动态计算模态间差分特征作为指导信号反馈给MFRM，从而自适应地融合互补信息，同时抑制跨模态的共模噪声。MFRM和DFFM被集成到一个统一的框架中，称为IRDFusion。

Result: 在FLIR, LLVIP和M$^3$FD数据集上，IRDFusion实现了最先进的性能，并在各种具有挑战性的场景中始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IRDFusion通过迭代反馈逐步放大显著的关系信号，同时抑制特征噪声，从而实现高质量的跨模态融合，并带来显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

*Hengyu Fang,Yijiang Liu,Yuan Du,Li Du,Huanrui Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQAP-VLA: A training-free framework for accelerating VLA inference by co-designing quantization and token pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA compression methods are inefficient and incompatible with both quantization and token pruning.

Method: Proposes a quantization-aware token pruning criteria and improves quantizer design.

Result: Achieves significant speedup and performance gains on standard VLA models.

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA framework improves computational efficiency and inference speed while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自监督框架S-BEVLoc，用于LiDAR全局定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LiDAR的全局定位方法依赖于GPS或SLAM里程计提供的ground-truth位姿来监督网络训练，获取高精度ground-truth位姿需要大量的成本和精力。

Method: 利用关键点中心BEV图块之间的已知地理距离，从单个BEV图像构建训练三元组。使用卷积神经网络（CNN）提取局部特征，并采用NetVLAD聚合全局描述符。此外，引入SoftCos损失来加强从生成的三元组中学习。

Result: 在KITTI和NCLT大型数据集上的实验结果表明，S-BEVLoc在地点识别、回环闭合和全局定位任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc提供了一种可扩展的LiDAR全局定位方法，且避免了对ground-truth位姿的依赖， 相比于有监督的方法，具有更好的可扩展性。

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Result: 构建了FPI-Det数据集，并评估了YOLO和DETR检测器。

Conclusion: FPI-Det数据集的构建为评估细粒度人与设备交互提供了一个新的基准。

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,
providing baseline results and an analysis of performance across object sizes,
occlusion levels, and environments. Source code and dataset is available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有的分割模型难以分割由多个重叠叶片组成的完整植物个体，且需要大量特定物种的标注数据。

Method: 集成了一个基础分割模型（提取叶片实例）和一个视觉-语言模型（推理植物结构），无需额外训练。

Result: 在多个植物物种、生长阶段和拍摄环境的数据集上评估，ZeroPlantSeg 优于现有的零样本方法，并且比监督方法实现了更好的跨域性能。

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg 是一种有效的零样本植物分割方法，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

<details>

Motivation: CLIP在行人表示学习中面临缺乏大规模行人图像-文本数据和全局对比学习难以保持判别性局部特征的问题。

Method: 1) 开发了一个抗噪声数据构建流程，利用MLLM自动过滤和标注网络图像，生成大规模数据集WebPerson。2) 提出了GA-DMS框架，通过梯度注意力相似度自适应地屏蔽噪声文本标记，并加入掩码token预测目标，提高细粒度语义表示学习。

Result: GA-DMS在多个基准测试中取得了state-of-the-art的性能。

Conclusion: 本文通过数据构建和模型架构的协同改进，提升了CLIP在行人表示学习中的性能。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: ALL-PET: A low-resource PET foundation model in the projection domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labeled data and computational resources hinder large-scale PET foundation model development.

Method: Latent diffusion model with Radon mask augmentation, dynamic multi-mask mechanism, positive/negative mask constraints, and transparent medical attention.

Result: High-quality sinogram generation with 500 samples, comparable to models trained on larger datasets. Generalizes across tasks with low memory usage.

Conclusion: ALL-PET effectively addresses data scarcity and efficiency limitations in PET imaging, offering a flexible and interpretable solution.

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

Motivation: 拓扑数据分析中的持久同源性 (PH) 和人工神经网络 (ANN) 提供了不同的方法来从数据中推断拓扑结构。本文旨在研究在结构噪声下，用于拓扑估计的 ANN 是否可以替代 PH。

Method: 将 ANN 方法与基于立方体复形和有符号欧几里德距离变换 (SEDT) 的 PH 流程进行比较。使用一个合成数据集和两个真实世界的数据集。

Result: ANN 在噪声下优于 PH 方法，这可能是由于它们能够从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验。

Conclusion: 使用 ANN 进行拓扑估计是一种在结构噪声下替代 PH 的引人注目的方法。

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文从数据集的角度对视频理解领域的模型发展进行综述，着重分析了数据集的特性如何影响模型的架构设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的综述主要根据任务或模型系列对模型进行分类，忽略了数据集对架构演变的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白，从数据集的角度分析模型。

Method: 本文通过分析数据集的运动复杂性、时间跨度、分层组成和多模态丰富性，揭示了数据集施加的归纳偏置，并解释了模型如何响应这些偏置。

Result: 本文将里程碑式的模型，如双流网络、3D CNN、序列模型、Transformer 和多模态基础模型，重新解释为对数据集驱动压力的具体反应。

Conclusion: 本文通过统一数据集、归纳偏置和架构，为推进通用视频理解提供了一个全面的回顾和指导性路线图。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

TL;DR: OCELOT 2023 挑战赛旨在验证理解细胞和组织（细胞-组织）相互作用对于实现人类水平性能至关重要，并加速该领域的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的细胞检测模型难以复制病理学家在检查全切片图像时在不同放大倍率之间切换的行为，并且难以学习不同放大倍率下结构之间的相互依赖的语义。该领域的一个关键障碍是缺乏具有多尺度重叠细胞和组织注释的数据集。

Method: 挑战赛数据集包括来自六个器官的重叠细胞检测和组织分割注释，包含来自 306 个癌症基因组图谱 (TCGA) 全切片图像的 673 对，这些图像经过苏木精和伊红染色，分为训练、验证和测试子集。

Result: 参赛者提出的模型显着增强了对细胞-组织关系的理解。与未包含细胞-组织关系的基线纯细胞模型相比，最佳条目在测试集上的 F1 分数提高了 7.99。

Conclusion: 与传统的纯细胞检测方法相比，性能有了显着提高，这表明需要将多尺度语义纳入模型中。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Motivation: 无人机图像中的目标检测面临着小目标密集、尺度变化和遮挡等问题。

Method: 提出了RT-DETR++，它在RT-DETR模型的基础上，引入了基于通道门控注意力的上下采样机制（AU/AD）以及CSP-PAC技术，利用并行空洞卷积处理局部和上下文信息，以融合多尺度特征。

Conclusion: 该研究为实时检测系统中的特征编码设计提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

Motivation: 现实世界的应用中，贝叶斯推理的输入值通常是不精确的区间范围估计，而现有方法大多假设精确的输入值。

Method: 开发了一个区间二型贝叶斯定理，并提出了一种新颖的保守方法来避免输入中的潜在不一致性。同时，设计了一种灵活的算法，用于将专家提供的区间编码为二型模糊隶属函数。

Result: 开发了新的区间二型贝叶斯定理和区间编码算法。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了贝叶斯定理，使其能够处理不精确的输入概率，并提供了一种将专家知识融入贝叶斯推理的方法。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

Result: 实验结果表明，该微调模型在编译成功率、GDD遵循度、最佳实践应用和代码模块化指标方面均优于baseline模型和state-of-the-art的LLM。

Conclusion: 该系统有效地将LLM定位为简化游戏设计到实现过程的宝贵工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated game template generation
by transforming Game Design Documents (GDDs) into functional Unity game
prototypes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multi-modal Large
Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an end-to-end system that parses GDDs,
extracts structured game specifications, and synthesizes Unity-compatible C#
code that implements the core mechanics, systems, and architecture defined in
the design documentation. Our approach combines a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model
specialized for Unity code generation with a custom Unity integration package
that streamlines the implementation process. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model
achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to
state-of-the-art LLMs across compilation success, GDD adherence, best practices
adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high
adherence to GDD specifications across multiple game genres. Our system
effectively addresses critical gaps in AI-assisted game development,
positioning LLMs as valuable tools in streamlining the transition from game
design to implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将优化或满足问题的自然语言描述翻译成正确的MiniZinc模型具有挑战性，因为这个过程需要逻辑推理和约束编程专业知识。

Method: 该框架采用Agent方法，多个专门的LLM Agent通过全局约束类型分解建模任务。每个Agent专注于检测和生成特定类别的全局约束代码，最后由一个Assembler Agent将这些约束片段集成到完整的MiniZinc模型中。

Result: 初步实验表明，与one-shot prompting和chain-of-thought prompting等基线相比，该方法表现更好。

Conclusion: 该论文概述了未来工作的全面路线图，强调了潜在的增强和改进方向。

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复训练合成数据导致模型崩溃，现有缓解策略有限。

Method: 提出了一种置信度感知损失函数，称为截断交叉熵（TCE），用于降低高置信度预测的权重。

Result: TCE 显著延缓了递归训练中的模型崩溃，并将模型的保真度间隔延长了 2.3 倍以上。

Conclusion: 损失函数的设计为在合成数据时代保持生成模型质量提供了一种简单而强大的工具。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用少量样本的大型语言模型(LLM)来优化推荐任务中的指令提示的有效流程，以解决冷启动用户问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动用户问题会进一步降低推荐系统的有效性，因为无法访问历史行为信息。

Method: 我们引入了一种上下文条件提示公式化方法P(u, Ds) -> R̂，其中u是冷启动用户画像，Ds是精心设计的支持集，R̂是预测的排序项目列表。该流程使用token-level对齐和嵌入空间正则化，具有更高的语义保真度。

Result: 通过对基于transformer的自回归LLM(BioGPT, LLaMA-2, GPT-4)的系统实验，我们提供了经验证据，表明最佳的示例注入和指令结构可以显著提高这些模型在低数据设置下的precision@k和NDCG分数。

Conclusion: 本文表明，基于prompt的适配可以被认为是解决基于llm的管道中冷启动推荐问题的方法之一。

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

Motivation: 评估智能体在动态、多智能体环境中协商过程，并考虑到不同智能体的优势。

Method: 在动态协商环境中比较人类、GPT-4o、Gemini 1.5 Pro 和贝叶斯智能体。

Result: 贝叶斯智能体通过激进优化获得最高收益，但交易拒绝率高；人类和 LLM 可以获得相似的整体收益，但行为不同：LLM 倾向于保守的让步式交易，拒绝率低，而人类采用更具策略性、冒险性和公平性的行为。

Conclusion: 性能对等可能会掩盖过程和一致性的根本差异，这对于在实际协调任务中的实际部署至关重要。

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究概述了潜在的研究方向，强调了有希望推广跨动态或非结构化环境的空间推理的路线图。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

Result: 在INTERACTION和Argoverse 2基准测试中取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: ProgD能有效提升多智能体运动预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Method: 提出一个可扩展的流程，用于从真实的Jupyter notebooks中提取高质量、基于工具的数据分析任务及其可执行的多步骤解决方案，并构建了一个大型数据集NbQA。提出了一个名为Jupiter的框架，该框架将数据分析问题形式化为搜索问题，并应用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）来生成多样化的解决方案轨迹，用于价值模型学习。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning
and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,
respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.
Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use
reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在基于事实和局部上下文的提取方面表现出色，但在处理复杂、广泛的文本时遇到限制，需要对文本和上下文进行更深入的分析。

Method: 比较了三种构建知识图谱三元组的方法：spaCy、Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE和GraphRAG，并将它们与大型语言模型集成以进行问答。

Result: 实验结果表明，OpenIE提供了最全面的三元组覆盖，而GraphRAG在三种方法中表现出卓越的推理能力。

Conclusion: 讨论了每种方法的优缺点，并为改进基于知识图谱的问答提供了未来方向的见解。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

Conclusion: 提出了启发式和统计解决方案来缓解这些问题，并讨论了在分阶段或树状奖励结构下学习的开放性挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

Motivation: 在快节奏决策环境中，许多团队需要在没有视觉线索或大量明确沟通的情况下协调他们在物理空间中的行动。现有研究主要集中在共址同步团队或分布式团队的知识工作协调上，而忽略了消防员、军队、执法部门、应急响应等团队。

Method: 通过在线搜索和救援任务，限制明确沟通，依靠移动模式推断他人意图和协调行动，研究空间协调的三个维度对团队表现的影响。使用空间邻近性、分布模式和共享环境中运动对齐等指标来捕捉团队合作的关系方面。

Result: 空间专业化正向预测绩效，而自适应空间邻近性表现出边际倒U型关系，表明适度的适应水平是最佳的。这些指标的时间动态可以区分高绩效和低绩效团队。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了对基于角色的团队合作中隐式空间协调的见解，并强调了平衡的自适应策略的重要性，对培训和人工智能辅助团队支持系统具有影响。

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

Conclusion: TAM Bench提供了一个更实用、更全面的平台，用于评估和比较LLM agent在端到端ML任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

Conclusion: 通过展示一种将常识语义推理与自主智能体相结合的实用且可扩展的方法，这项研究为在机器人技术中追求完全智能化和自主引导的探索提供了一种新方法。

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

Method: 引入Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO)，它旨在利用模型的内部推理能力来生成跨各种任务的适当响应，而无需手动制作的few-shot示例。

Result: TORSO 在各种 LLM 基准测试中取得了强大的性能，并具有合理的理由。

Conclusion: TORSO 能够使LLM在各种任务中生成合适的响应，并且具有不错的性能。

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

Motivation: 现有方法容易积累噪声、内存无控制扩展且跨域泛化能力有限。

Method: SEDM集成了基于可重现回放的可验证写入许可、根据经验效用动态排序和整合条目的自调度内存控制器，以及跨域知识扩散。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估表明，SEDM提高了推理准确性，同时减少了token开销，并能够从事实验证中提取知识以增强多跳推理。

Conclusion: SEDM是开放式多智能体协作的可扩展和可持续的记忆机制。

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

Method: 将组合张量模型的表示解释为希尔伯特空间中的表示，并训练变分量子电路以学习这些表示。使用了多热编码 (MHE) 和角度/幅度编码两种图像编码技术。

Result: 使用带噪声的 MHE 编码获得了良好的概念验证结果。CLIP 图像向量的性能表现不一，但仍优于经典的组合模型。

Conclusion: 量子模型在组合泛化图像字幕任务中具有潜力，但仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）的持续扩展是否会产生收益递减？本文研究发现，单步准确率的边际收益可以转化为模型成功完成任务长度的指数级提升。LLM在简单任务变长时失败，是由于执行中的错误，而不是推理能力不足。通过显式提供知识和计划来隔离执行能力，发现更大的模型可以正确执行更多的步骤。模型的每步准确率随着步数的增加而降低，这不仅是由于长上下文的限制，还观察到一种自条件反射效应——当上下文中包含先前回合的错误时，模型更容易犯错误。最近的思维模型没有自条件反射，并且可以在一轮中执行更长的任务。通过关注执行能力，希望可以协调关于LLM如何解决复杂的推理问题，但在任务变长时却在简单任务上失败的争论，并强调了扩展模型大小和顺序测试时计算对长时程任务的巨大好处。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型的实际价值通常源于智能体可以完成的任务长度。当简单任务变长时，大型语言模型会失败。

Method: 通过显式提供知识和计划来隔离执行能力，并观察模型在执行长时程任务时的表现。

Result: 更大的模型可以正确执行更多的步骤，即使小型模型具有100%的单步准确率。模型的每步准确率随着步数的增加而降低。模型容易出现自条件反射效应，而思维模型没有自条件反射，可以在一轮中执行更长的任务。

Conclusion: 通过关注执行能力，可以更好地理解大型语言模型在长时程任务中的表现，并认识到扩展模型大小和顺序测试时计算对长时程任务的益处。

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前生物医学研究中的知识图谱构建需要大量冗余劳动，这是由于缺乏数据标准和“知识图谱就绪”数据源造成的。

Method: 将知识图谱摄取转化为一组原始操作，通过YAML文件提供配置，并强制遵守所选的数据模式。

Result: 介绍了Koza和Koza-Hub，一个Python软件包，以及一套用于三十个黄金标准生物医学数据源的转换流程。

Conclusion: 使用KGX标准，旨在解决生物医学知识图谱构建中数据标准和“知识图谱就绪”数据源的不足问题，从而减少冗余劳动。

Abstract: Knowledge graph construction has become an essential domain for the future of
biomedical research. But current approaches demand a high amount of redundant
labor. These redundancies are the result of the lack of data standards and
"knowledge-graph ready" data from sources. Using the KGX standard, we aim to
solve these issues. Herein we introduce Koza and the Koza-Hub, a Python
software package which streamlines ingesting raw biomedical information into
the KGX format, and an associated set of conversion processes for thirty gold
standard biomedical data sources. Our approach is to turn knowledge graph
ingests into a set of primitive operations, provide configuration through YAML
files, and enforce compliance with the chosen data schema.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单的基于计数的嵌入方法，用于评估活动之间的分布相似性，避免了复杂的训练过程，并提供直接可解释的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的过程挖掘方法通常采用基于神经网络的方法来评估活动相似性，但这些方法计算成本高，可解释性有限。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于计数的嵌入方法，该方法避免了复杂的训练过程，并提供直接可解释的表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于计数的嵌入为事件数据中活动之间的分布相似性提供了高效的基础。

Conclusion: 基于计数的嵌入方法在活动分布相似性方面非常有效。

Abstract: To obtain insights from event data, advanced process mining methods assess
the similarity of activities to incorporate their semantic relations into the
analysis. Here, distributional similarity that captures similarity from
activity co-occurrences is commonly employed. However, existing work for
distributional similarity in process mining adopt neural network-based
approaches as developed for natural language processing, e.g., word2vec and
autoencoders. While these approaches have been shown to be effective, their
downsides are high computational costs and limited interpretability of the
learned representations.
  In this work, we argue for simplicity in the modeling of distributional
similarity of activities. We introduce count-based embeddings that avoid a
complex training process and offer a direct interpretable representation. To
underpin our call for simple embeddings, we contribute a comprehensive
benchmarking framework, which includes means to assess the intrinsic quality of
embeddings, their performance in downstream applications, and their
computational efficiency. In experiments that compare against the state of the
art, we demonstrate that count-based embeddings provide a highly effective and
efficient basis for distributional similarity between activities in event data.

*Agapi Rissaki,Ilias Fountalis,Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Benny Kimelfeld*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的框架，用于解释关系数据库上的机器学习模型，通过视图定义来突出显示对模型预测贡献最大的数据库部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释关系数据库上复杂深度学习模型（如异构图神经网络）的预测，因为这些模型的复杂性使得难以理解模型如何使用数据进行预测。

Method: 该框架通过调整确定性和简洁性之间的权衡，并采用不同粒度的视图定义片段（例如突出显示整个列、表之间的外键、相关的元组组等）来建立全局溯因解释。此外，还针对异构图神经网络开发了启发式算法和模型无关/模型相关的技术。

Result: 在 RelBench 集合上进行了广泛的实验评估，结果表明该方法能够生成有效且高效的解释。

Conclusion: 该框架能够为关系数据库上的机器学习模型提供有用的解释，并且其生成过程是高效的。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of
deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based
on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph
transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and
links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical
expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it
hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available
data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for
explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where
explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database
that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global
abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,
Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between
determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of
granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones
highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of
tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case
of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive
search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are
model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of
learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical
study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different
record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.

### [90] [Generative Engine Optimization: How to Dominate AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08919)
*Mahe Chen,Xiaoxuan Wang,Kaiwen Chen,Nick Koudas*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 生成式AI搜索的快速发展正在改变信息检索方式，从传统的排名列表转向综合的、有引文支持的答案。这需要一种新的范式，即生成式引擎优化（GEO）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的搜索引擎优化(SEO)已经不能满足当前生成式AI搜索的需求，所以需要一个新的范式(GEO)。

Method: 通过一系列大规模的对照实验，跨多个垂直领域、语言和查询释义，量化了AI搜索和传统网络搜索在信息来源方面的关键差异。

Result: AI搜索在很大程度上系统性地偏向于赢得媒体（第三方权威来源），而不是品牌自有内容和社交内容，这与谷歌更平衡的组合形成了鲜明对比。AI搜索服务在领域多样性、新鲜度、跨语言稳定性和对措辞的敏感性方面彼此差异显著。

Conclusion: 基于这些实验结果，我们制定了一个战略性的GEO议程。强调了以下关键需求：(1)为机器可扫描性和论证设计内容，(2)主导赢得媒体以建立AI感知权威，(3)采用引擎特定的和语言感知的策略，以及(4)克服小众参与者的固有“大品牌偏见”。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving
from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This
shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and
necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization
(GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and
traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled
experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we
quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key
findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias
towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and
Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further
demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in
their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to
phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We
provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need
to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2)
dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt
engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent
"big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational
empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the
new generative search landscape.

Motivation: 探讨在推荐系统中，使用嫉妒作为公平性度量标准是否合适，尤其是在个性化推荐的背景下。

Method: 概述无嫉妒性的概念及其在经济学和推荐系统中的应用，并通过论证说明其不适用性。

Result: 论证了在个性化推荐的场景下，使用嫉妒来衡量公平性是不合适的。

Conclusion: 在个性化推荐系统中，不应使用嫉妒作为衡量公平性的标准。

Abstract: Envy-freeness and the relaxation to Envy-freeness up to one item (EF-1) have
been used as fairness concepts in the economics, game theory, and social choice
literatures since the 1960s, and have recently gained popularity within the
recommendation systems communities. In this short position paper we will give
an overview of envy-freeness and its use in economics and recommendation
systems; and illustrate why envy is not appropriate to measure fairness for use
in settings where personalization plays a role.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MambaRec: A novel multimodal recommendation framework using attention-guided learning for local feature alignment and global distribution regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal recommendation systems have limitations in modeling fine-grained cross-modal associations and maintaining global distribution-level consistency, leading to suboptimal fusion quality and representational bias.

Method: Introduces the Dilated Refinement Attention Module (DREAM) for fine-grained semantic alignment between visual and textual modalities, and applies Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive loss functions for global modality alignment. Also employs a dimensionality reduction strategy to improve scalability.

Result: MambaRec outperforms existing methods in fusion quality, generalization, and efficiency on real-world e-commerce datasets.

Conclusion: MambaRec effectively addresses the limitations of existing multimodal recommendation systems by integrating local feature alignment and global distribution regularization.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly becoming foundational
technologies for e-commerce and content platforms, enabling personalized
services by jointly modeling users' historical behaviors and the multimodal
features of items (e.g., visual and textual). However, most existing methods
rely on either static fusion strategies or graph-based local interaction
modeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model
fine-grained cross-modal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality;
and (2) a lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing
representational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework
that integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization
via attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement
Attention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with
channel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns
between visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical
relationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic
modeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive
loss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic
consistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and
boosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs a dimensionality
reduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-dimensional
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets
show that MambaRec outperforms existing methods in fusion quality,
generalization, and efficiency. Our code has been made publicly available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CESRec的新框架，该框架集成了SRS的长期偏好建模和CRS的实时偏好提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SRS方法通常依赖于协同过滤信号，无法捕捉实时用户偏好，而CRS擅长通过自然语言交互来激发即时兴趣，但忽略了历史行为。为了弥合这一差距

Method: 引入了基于语义的伪交互构建，通过分析会话反馈动态更新用户的历史交互序列，生成无缝结合长期和实时偏好的伪交互序列。此外，通过提出双重对齐异常项屏蔽来减少偏离用户核心偏好的历史项中的异常值的影响，该方法使用语义协作对齐表示来识别和屏蔽这些项目。

Result: 通过增强强大的SRS模型，CESRec实现了最先进的性能，验证了其在将对话反馈集成到SRS中的有效性。

Conclusion: CESRec有效地集成了SRS和CRS，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: Sequential Recommendation Systems (SRS) have become essential in many
real-world applications. However, existing SRS methods often rely on
collaborative filtering signals and fail to capture real-time user preferences,
while Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS) excel at eliciting immediate
interests through natural language interactions but neglect historical
behavior. To bridge this gap, we propose CESRec, a novel framework that
integrates the long-term preference modeling of SRS with the real-time
preference elicitation of CRS. We introduce semantic-based pseudo interaction
construction, which dynamically updates users'historical interaction sequences
by analyzing conversational feedback, generating a pseudo-interaction sequence
that seamlessly combines long-term and real-time preferences. Additionally, we
reduce the impact of outliers in historical items that deviate from users'core
preferences by proposing dual alignment outlier items masking, which identifies
and masks such items using semantic-collaborative aligned representations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CESRec achieves state-of-the-art
performance by boosting strong SRS models, validating its effectiveness in
integrating conversational feedback into SRS.

*Alan Said,Maria Soledad Pera,Michael D. Ekstrand*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Recommender systems research is still flawed despite added sophistication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems research suffers from statistical misinterpretations and methodological shortcuts.

Method: The paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis, draws on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental impact, and participatory design, and highlights ongoing community-led initiatives.

Result: The field's accelerating complexity has outpaced its introspection.

Conclusion: Meaningful change requires a fundamental reframing of recommender systems research grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable practice.

Abstract: In 2011, Xavier Amatriain sounded the alarm: recommender systems research was
"doing it all wrong" [1]. His critique, rooted in statistical misinterpretation
and methodological shortcuts, remains as relevant today as it was then. But
rather than correcting course, we added new layers of sophistication on top of
the same broken foundations. This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and
argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural
failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms. Drawing
on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental
impact, and participatory design, we showcase how the field's accelerating
complexity has outpaced its introspection. We highlight ongoing community-led
initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation
frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the
same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics
or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems
research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated.
Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems
research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable
practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言密集检索旨在基于统一的检索模型检索不同语言的相关文档，其挑战在于对齐共享向量空间中不同语言的表示。

Method: 通过高质量负样本和有效的小批量数据来提高数据利用率。

Result: 在包含 16 种语言的多语言检索基准 MIRACL 上的大量实验结果表明，该方法优于几个现有的强基线，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提高数据利用率，有效提升了多语言密集检索的性能。

Abstract: Multilingual dense retrieval aims to retrieve relevant documents across
different languages based on a unified retriever model. The challenge lies in
aligning representations of different languages in a shared vector space. The
common practice is to fine-tune the dense retriever via contrastive learning,
whose effectiveness highly relies on the quality of the negative sample and the
efficacy of mini-batch data. Different from the existing studies that focus on
developing sophisticated model architecture, we propose a method to boost data
utilization for multilingual dense retrieval by obtaining high-quality hard
negative samples and effective mini-batch data. The extensive experimental
results on a multilingual retrieval benchmark, MIRACL, with 16 languages
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by outperforming several existing
strong baselines.

Motivation: 研究 Reddit 社区 AskDoc，作为一个公共 AtD 平台，了解其在医疗建议方面的运作方式，并探讨其是否能弥合患者和医生之间的距离。

Method: 从 AskDoc subreddit 下载 2020 年 1 月至 2022 年 5 月的数据，使用正则表达式识别帖子中自我报告的人口统计信息（性别、种族和年龄），并进行统计分析以了解同行和医生与发帖者之间的互动。

Result: 一半的帖子没有收到同行或医生的评论。至少 90% 的人公开了他们的性别和年龄，80% 的人没有公开他们的种族。该 subreddit 主要由成年（20-39 岁）白人男性主导。在用户和具有特定人口统计特征的发帖者之间的互动中观察到了一些差异。与发帖者相比，当前医生的参与度较低。

Conclusion: 社交媒体可以将患者和提供者更紧密地联系在一起，但目前医生的参与度较低。

Abstract: The objective of this study is to understand the online Ask the Doctor
services medical advice on internet platforms via AskDoc, a Reddit community
that serves as a public AtD platform and study if platforms mirror existing
hurdles and partiality in healthcare across various demographic groups. We
downloaded data from January 2020 to May 2022 from AskDoc -- a subreddit, and
created regular expressions to identify self-reported demographics (Gender,
Race, and Age) from the posts, and performed statistical analysis to understand
the interaction between peers and physicians with the posters. Half of the
posts did not receive comments from peers or physicians. At least 90% of the
people disclose their gender and age, and 80% of the people do not disclose
their race. It was observed that the subreddit is dominated by adult (age group
20-39) white males. Some disparities were observed in the engagement between
the users and the posters with certain demographics. Beyond the confines of
clinics and hospitals, social media could bring patients and providers closer
together, however, as observed, current physicians participation is low
compared to posters.

Conclusion: 有针对性的基础方法为监管问答提供了一个简单而强大的基线，以及有效的领域特定解决方案。

Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge,
the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from
authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess
retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which
our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our
approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In
particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval
yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline
results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that
carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an
effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code

Conclusion: 提出了一种直观的置信度估计和分解框架。

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MMWU算法在矩阵LEA问题上实现了minimax最优的遗憾界，但本文旨在进一步改进算法，实现实例最优的遗憾界。

Method: 本文首先为矩阵LEA开发了一个通用的基于势的框架，然后利用基于拉普拉斯变换技术的新型“单边”Jensen迹不等式，并基于虚误差函数，从向量LEA问题中推导出一个最优势函数。

Result: 本文提出的算法实现了O(√(T⋅S(X||d⁻¹I_d)))的实例最优遗憾界，且计算复杂度与MMWU相同。该算法在学习受退极化噪声、随机量子态和吉布斯态污染的量子态方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 本文提出的改进MMWU算法在矩阵LEA问题上实现了实例最优的遗憾界，并在量子学习理论中具有广泛的应用前景，例如预测非线性量子属性。

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在奖励信号受到对抗性破坏的强化学习（RL）环境中学习最优策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中，奖励信号可能受到极端噪声、传感器故障或恶意攻击等对抗性破坏，这会严重降低传统算法（如 Q-learning）的性能。为了解决这个问题，论文提出了新的鲁棒性 Q-learning 算法。

Method: 该论文提出了新的鲁棒性 Q-learning 算法，该算法即使在一部分观测到的奖励被对抗者任意扰动的情况下也能有效运行。该算法在异步采样模型下工作，并利用了 refined Azuma-Hoeffding 不等式。

Result: 该论文证明了即使存在对抗性破坏，该算法的有限时间收敛速度与非对抗情况下的现有结果相匹配，但增加了一个与损坏样本比例成正比的附加项。此外，论文还导出了一个信息论下界，表明上限中的附加损坏项是不可避免的。

Conclusion: 该论文为异步 Q-learning 提供了第一个有限时间鲁棒性保证，弥合了鲁棒 RL 中的一个重要差距。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习 (ML) 模型的性能关键取决于训练数据的质量和代表性。在具有多个异构数据生成源的应用程序中，标准的 ML 方法通常学习虚假的相关性，这些相关性平均表现良好，但会降低非典型或代表性不足的组的性能。

Method: 我们开发了一种梯度下降-上升算法来解决所提出的 DRO 问题，并提供了收敛结果。

Result: 在真实世界的数据上验证了我们方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于 Wasserstein 的 DRO 框架，用于提高机器学习模型在异构数据源上的鲁棒性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and scalable diagnostic systems for Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are important, but current ECG analysis methods are limited by noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity.

Method: The model integrates dual-stage denoising, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Time Series Transformers (TST) to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals.

Result: Achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease detection.

Conclusion: FoundationalECGNet is a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated ECG analysis.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim) 的方法，该方法从 LLM 中提取领域知识和推理能力，以更好地辅助预测，从而提高模拟性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 问答 (QA) 模拟器是一种模仿真实学生学习行为并预测他们回答问题正确性的模型。问答模拟器使教育推荐系统 (ERS) 能够在不与真实学生互动的情况下收集大量训练数据，从而防止训练不足的 ERS 做出有害的推荐，从而破坏实际的学生学习。

Method: 该方法从 LLM 中提取领域知识和推理能力，以更好地辅助预测。

Result: LDSim 在模拟任务和知识追踪 (KT) 任务上都取得了不错的成果。

Conclusion: LDSim 是一种有前景的 QA 模拟器，它具有提高教育推荐系统性能的潜力。

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LDSim-05A9.

TL;DR: 本文通过将 Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) 类归因方法表示为修正梯度矩阵的乘积，分析了其数值性质。并推导了奇异值的上限和归因图值的分量上限，以揭示归因值的分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地理解归因值的分布

Method: 将LRP类归因方法表示为修正梯度矩阵的乘积，并推导奇异值的上限和归因图值的分量上限。

Result: 推导出控制归因经验均值收敛到归因图期望的乘法常数。LRP-beta 的常数与权重范数无关，这与基于梯度的方法和 LRP-epsilon 都有显着区别。

Conclusion: 该发现对应用于单个测试样本的多个非几何数据增强以及 Smoothgrad 类归因方法具有重要意义。

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

Result: 在真实 CI 数据上的实验表明，我们的调度器优于与时滞无关的基线，在各种碳预算下实现了更高的模型精度，尤其是在严格的碳约束下获得了强大的收益。

Conclusion: 碳感知调度器优于与时滞无关的基线，在各种碳预算下实现了更高的模型精度，尤其是在严格的碳约束下获得了强大的收益。

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地识别有前途的聚合物设计，同时视觉和语言解释有助于专家驱动的分析和知识发现。

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

Motivation: Transformer具有模拟大规模并行计算（MPC）算法的表征能力，但它们受到二次时间复杂度的影响，这严重限制了它们的可扩展性。

Method: 引入了一种名为近似最近邻注意力（ANNA）的有效注意力机制。

Result: ANNA-transformer：(1) 在匹配MPC算法能力方面，保留了先前为标准注意力建立的表达能力，(2) 可以以接近最优的深度解决诸如Match2和$k$-hop的关键推理任务。

Conclusion: 常数深度的ANNA-transformer可以模拟常数深度的低秩transformer，从而为推理广泛的有效注意力近似提供了一种统一的方法。

Abstract: Transformers have the representational capacity to simulate Massively
Parallel Computation (MPC) algorithms, but they suffer from quadratic time
complexity, which severely limits their scalability. We introduce an efficient
attention mechanism called Approximate Nearest Neighbor Attention (ANNA) with
sub-quadratic time complexity. We prove that ANNA-transformers (1) retain the
expressive power previously established for standard attention in terms of
matching the capabilities of MPC algorithms, and (2) can solve key reasoning
tasks such as Match2 and $k$-hop with near-optimal depth. Using the MPC
framework, we further prove that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate
constant-depth low-rank transformers, thereby providing a unified way to reason
about a broad class of efficient attention approximations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在网络安全和金融等领域，异常检测至关重要，尤其是在处理大规模表格数据时。然而，无监督异常检测仍然是一个重大挑战。现有的深度学习方法忽略了表格数据中异构上下文，降低了检测性能。

Method: 该方法自动识别上下文特征，并使用简单的深度自动编码器对条件数据分布进行建模。

Result: 在多个表格基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: 上下对于准确区分异常实例和正常实例至关重要。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

Conclusion: MoWE模型是一种计算效率高且可扩展的策略，可以通过充分利用高质量的预报模型来改进数据驱动的天气预报。

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

TL;DR: STRIDE: A scalable XAI framework using functional decomposition in RKHS to address limitations of feature subset reasoning and scalar summarization in existing XAI methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing XAI frameworks suffer from exponential cost in feature subset reasoning and reduced expressiveness due to scalar summarization.

Method: STRIDE frames explanation as subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition in RKHS, computing functional components via analytical projection and recursive kernel-centering.

Result: STRIDE achieves speedups (0.6x to 9.7x, median 3.0x) compared to TreeSHAP on tabular datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2: 0.81-0.999) and substantial rank agreement.

Conclusion: STRIDE complements scalar attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective and enabling novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' for quantitative impact measurement of specific interactions.

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

Conclusion: 该方法在各种实际应用中都具有明显的优势，突出了其稳健性、实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a

tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA 是一种高效的微调方法，可以动态地将秩分配给权重矩阵，并且在各种任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统的机器学习和深度学习模型通常依赖于基于相关的学习，但这种学习方法通常无法区分真正的因果关系和虚假关联，从而限制了模型的鲁棒性、可解释性和泛化能力。

Method: 利用1979-2021年43年的北极海冰范围（SIE）数据以及相关的海洋-大气变量（包括日分辨率和月分辨率），该方法识别出具有因果影响的预测因子，确定SIE动态的直接原因的优先级，减少不必要的特征，并提高计算效率。

Conclusion: 该框架可广泛应用于其他动态、高维领域，为因果信息预测建模的理论基础和实际性能提供了一种可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种用于多智能体强化学习的连续时间框架 (CT-MARL)，该框架使用物理信息神经网络 (PINN) 来大规模逼近基于 HJB 的值函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习 (RL) 方法难以处理需要在高频率或不规则时间间隔进行交互的复杂动态系统。虽然 CTRL 显示出了希望，但其应用在很大程度上仅限于单智能体领域。这种限制源于两个关键挑战：(i) HJB 方程的传统求解方法存在维度诅咒 (CoD)，使其在高维系统中难以处理；(ii) 即使使用基于 HJB 的学习方法，准确逼近多智能体环境中的集中式值函数仍然很困难，这反过来又会破坏策略训练。

Method: 我们通过引入一个值梯度迭代 (VGI) 模块来对齐值学习与值梯度学习，该模块沿轨迹迭代地细化值梯度。这提高了梯度保真度，进而产生更准确的值和更强的策略学习。

Result: 我们的结果表明，我们的方法始终优于现有的连续时间 RL 基线，并且可以扩展到复杂的多智能体动态。

Conclusion: 我们使用标准基准的连续时间变体（包括多智能体粒子环境 (MPE) 和多智能体 MuJoCo）评估了我们的方法。

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

*Md Ibrahim Ibne Alam,Ankur Senapati,Anindo Mahmood,Murat Yuksel,Koushik Kar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究利用机器学习模型预测ISP对等互联关系，以提高全球互联网连接的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对等互联比 transit 服务更优化，但过程复杂耗时，自动化对等互联伙伴选择可以提高效率。

Method: 使用公开数据，评估三种机器学习模型（树型、神经网络和 Transformer）预测对等互联关系。

Result: 基于树模型的 XGBoost 表现最佳，准确率达 98%，且对时间、空间和缺失数据具有弹性。

Conclusion: 该方法可帮助 ISP 自动化对等互联伙伴选择，从而优化互联网生态系统。

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

### [119] [HISPASpoof: A New Dataset For Spanish Speech Forensics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09155)
*Maria Risques,Kratika Bhagtani,Amit Kumar Singh Yadav,Edward J. Delp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了第一个大型西班牙语数据集HISPASpoof，用于合成语音检测和归因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音取证技术主要集中在英语和中文，西班牙语语音取证的研究不足，存在安全隐患。

Method: 构建了一个包含六种口音的真实语音和六种零样本TTS系统生成的合成语音的大型西班牙语数据集HISPASpoof，并评估了五种代表性方法。

Result: 实验表明，在英语数据上训练的检测器无法推广到西班牙语，而在HISPASpoof上训练可以显著提高检测性能。同时，还评估了HISPASpoof上的合成语音归因性能。

Conclusion: HISPASpoof为推进可靠且包容的西班牙语语音取证提供了一个关键的基准。

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

Result: 该方法在保持竞争精度的同时，显著减少了浮点运算。

Conclusion: 该研究为在未来的边缘智能系统中部署基于Transformer的语义通信建立了一种可扩展且高效的方法。

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

*Hanyi Mao,Quanjia Xiao,Lei Pang,Haixiao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization) is introduced to address length unfairness in sequence-level reinforcement learning for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PPO/GRPO-style clipping methods distort the effective objective by systematically reweighting short vs. long responses.

Method: FSPO clips the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and scales as sqrt(L).

Result: FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: FSPO effectively enforces length-fair clipping, leading to improved performance and stability.

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DART模型，用于解决天气模型中模糊预测的问题，尤其是在极端对流天气检测方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习天气模型评估指标存在“统计相似性陷阱”，导致模型倾向于给出模糊的预测，而忽略了罕见但影响重大的事件。这篇文章旨在解决将粗糙的大气预测转化为高分辨率卫星亮度温度场，并优化极端对流检测的问题。

Method: DART采用双解码器架构，显式地进行背景/极端分解，并结合物理驱动的过采样和特定任务的损失函数。

Result: 1) 验证了多种复杂基线模型中存在的“统计相似性陷阱”；2) 发现移除综合水汽输送（IVT）反而能提高极端对流检测能力；3) 通过实验证明了DART架构的必要性；4) 通过2023年8月的吉大港洪水灾害案例进行了真实世界的验证。

Conclusion: DART框架能够实现精确的操作校准，在标准硬件上训练时间短，并且可以无缝集成到现有的气象工作流程中，为极端天气准备提供了一条可信赖的人工智能途径。

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在连续控制环境中，平衡奖励最大化和约束满足之间的权衡仍然是一个巨大的挑战。策略优化方法在约束边界附近经常表现出不稳定性，导致次优的训练性能。

Method: 提出了一种名为增量惩罚近端策略优化 (IP3O) 的算法，该算法实施逐渐增加的惩罚以稳定训练动态。

Result: 在基准环境中的经验评估表明，与最先进的安全强化学习算法相比，IP3O 的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过推导算法所实现的最佳性的最坏情况误差的界限，我们提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业旅游作为一种战略经济模式，通过多样化农民等当地社区的收入来源，同时促进土著文化遗产和传统农业实践的保护，从而促进农村发展。作为旅游业一个非常蓬勃发展的子领域，需要详细研究农业旅游增长的战略。

Method: 该研究分两个阶段进行：第一阶段通过全面的文献综述确定重要指标；第二阶段使用最先进的技术来识别农业旅游增长的重要指标。应用了特征选择的机器学习模型，观察到最小绝对收缩和选择算子（LASSO）方法与逻辑回归（LR）、决策树（DT）、随机森林（RF）树和极端梯度提升（XGBOOST）等机器学习分类器相结合，可用于预测农业旅游的增长。

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate
rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like
farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and
traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in
detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the
growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine
Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and
XGBoost follow with 97% accuracy.

TL;DR: Vejde是一个框架，它结合了数据抽象、图神经网络和强化学习，为具有丰富结构状态（如对象类和关系）的决策问题生成归纳策略函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决具有丰富结构状态的决策问题，例如对象类和关系。

Method: 该框架将MDP状态表示为关于实体的数据库，并将每个状态转换为二分图，通过神经消息传递将其映射到潜在状态。

Result: 在八个RDDL问题域中测试了Vejde代理，每个问题域有十个问题实例。结果表明，Vejde策略在平均水平上推广到测试实例，而分数没有显着降低。此外，归纳代理在未见过的测试实例上获得的分数平均接近于特定于实例的MLP代理。

Conclusion: Vejde策略可以推广到未见过的测试实例，而分数没有显着降低，并且性能接近于特定于实例的MLP代理。

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

*Hanyang Wang,Yuxuan Yang,Hongjun Wang,Lihui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于小样本无监督旋转机械故障诊断的多注意力元Transformer方法 (MMT-FD)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际工业应用中，获取足够的故障数据具有挑战性且成本高昂；不同类型的旋转机械设备需要单独训练诊断模型。

Method: 该框架集成了时频域编码器和元学习泛化模型。时频域编码器预测通过时频域中的随机增强生成的状态表示。然后将这些增强的数据馈送到元学习网络中，用于分类和泛化训练，然后使用少量标记数据进行微调。使用少量的对比学习迭代来迭代优化模型。

Result: 在轴承故障数据集和转子试验台数据上进行的实验表明，MMT-FD模型仅使用 1% 的标记样本数据即可实现 99% 的故障诊断准确率，并具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MMT-FD 模型在少量标签数据下表现出强大的泛化能力，适用于各种类型机械设备的故障诊断。

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.
