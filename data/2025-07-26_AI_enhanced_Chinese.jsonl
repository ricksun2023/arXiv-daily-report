By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were\nderived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics\nof the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic\nvelocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also\nperfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,\nwe propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the\nknowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining\nthe generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The\nproposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic\nexpressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,\nadhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key\ncontributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,\ninterpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation\napproaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models\nwith domain principles.

However, practical\ndeployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging\nconditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we\npresent \\textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,\ncomprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments\nincluding marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are\nharmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and\nsegmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.\nWe systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering\nthe YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.\nEvaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and\nmAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and\ninference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results\nhighlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,\nas well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of\ndifferent architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a\nCLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment\nto dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each\ninput image.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy.

We present ASI-Arch,\nthe first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research\n(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully\nautonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to\nconduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring\nhuman-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization\nto automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in\nthe domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel\narchitectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and\nempirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and\npast experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000\nGPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed\nunexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered\narchitectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically\nsurpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for\narchitectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling\nlaw for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural\nbreakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress\nfrom a human-limited to a computation-scalable process.

However, current\nprediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban\nenvironments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in\npersonal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the\ncomplex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand\nadvanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and\nrich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models\nin distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual\nunderstanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model\n(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the\nadaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to\ncapture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level\npatterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level\ndatasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,\nshowing outstanding generalization and adaptability.

In this work, we investigated how size and\nseparability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features\nand performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning\nmodels for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging\nDataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on\nimaging manufacturer) or non-separable \"pseudo-subgroups\". We found that\nsimulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature\nrepresentations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature\nspace were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the\nsubgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in\nsubgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels\nwas used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,\nwith label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive\nrate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean\nlabels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels.

Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the\nproximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body\ntransformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has\nremained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.\nThis paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function\nbetween two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation\n($\\mathbf{R}$ and $\\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous\nmathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear\nsubspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we\npropose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be\napplied to the registration problem of any affine subspace.

However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the\ninherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining\nmulti-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting\nframework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted\nviews. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and\nregion-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization.

In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel\nspoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,\ndesigned to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics.

Experimental results on\nTELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM\nachieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,\nand outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal\nvariation, and age-sensitive interactions.

HIV management is a compelling use case\ndue to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and\nadherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises\nconcerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite\ntheir promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM\nbenchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities\nof LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We\nintroduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question\nanswering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant\nquestions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We\nevaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying\nprompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework\nincorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended\nto better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key\ndimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,\npotential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro\nconsistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of\nthe top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question\ncomplexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform\ngeneral-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of\nperformance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual\nrecall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.\nThese findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to\nensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136Gemini 2.5 Pro\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a4\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u6cbb\u7597\u9886\u57df\u524d\u666f\u5e7f\u9614\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4fLLM\u57fa\u51c6\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86HIVMedQA\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u62a4\u7406\u4e2d\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7531\u5728\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u3001\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6574\u7406\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e03\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548cLLM-as-a-judge\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGemini 2.5 Pro\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u524d\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u662f\u4e13\u6709\u7684\u3002\u968f\u7740\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u533b\u5b66\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u6bd4\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8fd1\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u73b0\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a4\u7406\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6574\u5408\u3002"}}

This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to\ndirect LBM simulations.

However, existing studies face three\nmajor limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which\nfails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)\nintroducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;\nand (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like\nrelevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the\nMultimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,\nwhich mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment\nas a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality\nvariations.

While diffusion-based methods\nhave shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.\nHowever, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to\ncapture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to\nstructural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that\njointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light\nimages, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing\ngeneration quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from\nlow-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce\nan adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.\nBy leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes\nan implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise\ndistribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the\nmodels ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation.

In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector\nagainst LRMs, which we term \"overthinking backdoors\".

Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning\nmethodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals\nthe desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These\nresponses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject\na controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning\nprocess. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and\nestablishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive\nempirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably\ntrigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning\nprocess, without degrading the final answer's correctness.

The effectiveness of\nICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which\nfocused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive\nperformances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality\nexamples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)\nDifficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and\nfeedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR\ndecouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval\nmodule to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task\ndataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise\nand guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve\nhigh-quality examples.

In such contexts, it\nis often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\\it additional\nsupervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting\nnaturally raises fundamental questions: {\\it What kinds of additional\nsupervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\\it how do they contribute to\nimproved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a\ntheoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision\nas probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine\ncombination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of\nadditional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,\nbut rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled\nclasses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the\nmixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary\nroles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision\ndetermines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing\nthe hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the\nmixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through\ngeneralization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional\nsupervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and\nasymptotic value of the error bound.

It employs three\nnovel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow\nsemantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically\nvalid new trace variants.

Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at\ncapturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including\nuneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence\ncontext. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens\nwith optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This\nhybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the\nmodel to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences\nsimultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was\nevaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating\nsignificantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of\n10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER.

For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it\naccelerates inference by 6$\\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on\nFlickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\\times$ speedup with higher performance.\nMore comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and\nprovide an in-depth understanding of WINO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faWINO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u64a4\u9500\u89e3\u7801\u6765\u6539\u5584DLLM\u7684\u8d28\u91cf-\u901f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684DLLM\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8d28\u91cf-\u901f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8eDLLM\u4e2d\u6807\u51c6\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u89e3\u7801\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u6781\u5316\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u4f34\u968f\u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aWide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO)\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u652f\u6301DLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u64a4\u9500\u89e3\u7801\u3002WINO\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u8349\u6848\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u79ef\u6781\u8d77\u8349\u591a\u4e2atoken\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5c4f\u853d\u53ef\u7591token\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e866\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.58%\uff1b\u5728Flickr30K\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8610\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "WINO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728LLaDA\u548cMMaDA\u7b49\u5f00\u6e90DLLM\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8d28\u91cf-\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of\nnew samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full\nretraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable\nalternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while\nmitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet\noverlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which\nmanifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security\nregression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a\nmalware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a\nmodel update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in\nsecurity-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously\ndetected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating\nprocess. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression\nin CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to\nmitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL\nsetting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.\nExperiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method\neffectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining\nstrong detection performance over time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56de\u5f52\u611f\u77e5\u60e9\u7f5a\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5b83\u3002", "motivation": "\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60 (ML) \u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0d\u65ad\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u56de\u5f52\u4f1a\u5728\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\u6355\u83b7\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u66fe\u7ecf\u88ab\u6b63\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6837\u672c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u4f1a\u9003\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u540c\u4f59\u8bad\u7ec3 (PCT)\u3002", "result": "\u5728 ELSA\u3001Tesseract \u548c AZ-Class \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c CL \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56de\u5f52\u611f\u77e5\u60e9\u7f5a\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u5b89\u5168\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u540c\u4f59\u8bad\u7ec3 (PCT) \u4ee5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u5148\u524d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

These ice clouds can\nalter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of\naviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail\nformation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality\nof atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex\nprocesses like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.\nObservational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,\ncould be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing\ndatasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they\ntypically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their\nsource flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible\nCamera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded\nwith a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is\nindividually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its\nlifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and\nincludes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera.

Accurate estimation of a State of Health\n(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability\nand safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,\ntransformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from\ndischarge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities\ninherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at\nnon-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.\nTo address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences\nrather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and\ncompromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\narchitecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).\nTIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent\nirregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention\nmechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence\ninformation. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show\nthat TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%\nreduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below\n0.58%.

This work,\ntherefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness\ntesting, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and\nserving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u666e\u904d\u65f6\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6536\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7fa4\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5458\u5728\u83b7\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u5b9e\u9645\u548c\u6587\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u6ca1\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4ece\u8fd9\u79cd\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4ece\u8fd9\u79cd\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with\nlimited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This\nmethod is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker\ndecomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional\nclassification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as\na regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation\nof pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each\nEuler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension\nof the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.\nAlmost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.\nHence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our\ntraining set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering\nthe corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited\ntraining data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an\nobject from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around\neach axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data.
