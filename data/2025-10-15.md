TL;DR: 大型语言模型在解决逻辑难题时表现出记忆模板而非真正推理的倾向，当问题稍作修改，性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否真正进行推理，以及它们在面对逻辑难题的变体时的表现。

Method: 构建了一个名为PHANTOM RECALL的基准测试，包含25个逻辑难题和149个精心设计的扰动，用于评估11个主流大型语言模型。

Result: 模型在原始难题上表现接近完美，但在扰动后的难题上远逊于人类，表现出幻象回忆和过度阐述。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在上下文线索改变时，常常无法重新推理，表明语言流畅性和逻辑理解之间存在差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear
adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning
underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently
rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When
puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a
striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?
To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general
way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these
things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25
well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve
reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate
eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom
recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious
rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this
issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to
detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error
categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these
categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models
significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom
recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs
often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap
between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）可以作为世界模型来增强智能体在数字环境中的决策，但其幻觉和依赖静态知识的倾向限制了其能力。论文探讨了LLM在未来状态预测和奖励估计方面的能力，发现LLM在长期规划中性能迅速下降。为解决这些限制，论文提出了检索增强世界模型（R-WoM），通过整合外部知识来改进LLM的模拟能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）作为世界模型在数字环境中增强智能体决策能力的可能性，指出LLM存在幻觉和依赖静态知识的问题，限制了其长期模拟能力。

Method: 通过三个任务（下一状态识别、完整流程规划对齐和里程碑转换识别）来探究世界模型的两个核心能力——未来状态预测和奖励估计。提出了检索增强世界模型（R-WoM），通过从外部教程检索事实性、最新的知识来支持LLM的模拟。

Result: 分析表明，LLM能有效捕获即时下一状态并识别有意义的状态转换，但在完整流程规划中性能迅速下降。R-WoM在OSWorld和WebArena上相比基线分别取得了高达25.3%和18.1%的显著提升，尤其在长时域模拟中优势明显。

Conclusion: LLM在可靠地建模长期环境动态方面存在局限性，而检索增强世界模型（R-WoM）可以通过整合外部知识来显著提升LLM的模拟能力，尤其是在长时域模拟中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent
decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and
predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error
exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'
tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,
which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To
systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we
probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward
estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure
planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows
that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify
meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in
full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling
environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we
propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM
simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from
external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial
improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to
baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

### [3] [LLM Knowledge is Brittle: Truthfulness Representations Rely on Superficial Resemblance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11905)
*Patrick Haller,Mark Ibrahim,Polina Kirichenko,Levent Sagun,Samuel J. Bell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的可靠性至关重要，但研究表明，LLM 的性能可能很脆弱，对微不足道的输入变化表现出过度的敏感性。本文探讨了这种脆弱性是否是不稳定的内部知识表示的直接结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型 (LLM) 性能的脆弱性是否是不稳定的内部知识表示的直接结果。

Method: 通过评估经过表面转换的样本的表示可分离性来测试学习知识的稳健性，这些转换使它们脱离分布 (OOD)，例如拼写错误或重新表述。通过应用语义保留扰动，我们研究了随着语句变得更加 OOD，可分离性如何降低，跨越四个 LLM 系列、五个评估数据集和三种知识探测方法。

Result: 研究结果表明，当样本的呈现方式与预训练期间看到的样本不太相似时，语句真实性的内部表示就会崩溃。虽然 LLM 通常可以区分真实语句和虚假语句，但这种能力高度依赖于语句的确切表面形式。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可能学习了浅薄、不稳健的知识表示，这些表示仅允许有限的泛化。这项工作对真实性探测的效用提出了根本性的挑战，并更广泛地呼吁进一步研究改进学习的知识表示的稳健性。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust
knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike
those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM
performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to
trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is
a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this
question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode
statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily
separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of
learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that
have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution
(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving
perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more
OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge
probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement
truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to
those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true
and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this
ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These
findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs
may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only
limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the
utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on
improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

### [4] [LLM Reasoning for Machine Translation: Synthetic Data Generation over Thinking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11919)
*Armel Zebaze,Rachel Bawden,Benoît Sagot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型推理模型（LRM）在机器翻译（MT）中的应用，发现“思考令牌”并不能提高LRM的翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在机器翻译任务中的潜力，尤其是在生成中间令牌方面的作用。

Method: 通过在不同资源水平和多种设置下的多种语言对上进行机器翻译实验，并使用模仿人类翻译的思维链（CoT）进行微调。

Result: “思考令牌”并不能帮助LRM更好地执行机器翻译。微调一个具有合成CoT解释的模型，详细说明如何逐步翻译，并不能胜过标准的输入-输出微调。

Conclusion: 中间令牌的贡献高度依赖于其中翻译尝试的存在。使用教师来改进目标翻译或扩展并行语料库比将他们的CoT解释提炼成“思考”MT模型更有效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of
problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process
prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across
mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation
(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the
generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language
pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that
"thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes
to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of
thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,
fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate
step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,
constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular
translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings
underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning
highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More
broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations
or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT
explanations into "thinking" MT models.

*Lorena Calvo-Bartolomé,Valérie Aldana,Karla Cantarero,Alonso Madroñal de Mesa,Jerónimo Arenas-García,Jordan Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIND是一个用户参与的事实验证流程，用于检测多语言问答知识库中的事实和文化差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言问答系统必须确保跨语言的事实一致性，同时考虑到主观反应中的文化差异。

Method: 提出了一个用户参与的事实验证流程MIND，以突出显示对文化敏感问题的不同答案。

Result: MIND能够可靠地识别不一致性。

Conclusion: MIND支持开发更具文化意识和事实一致性的问答系统。

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency
across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?,
while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We
propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and
cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights
divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in
childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual
QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of
bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We
further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In
all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development
of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

### [6] [TopoAlign: A Framework for Aligning Code to Math via Topological Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11944)
*Yupei Li,Philipp Borchert,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为 TopoAlign 的框架，旨在通过将代码仓库转化为训练资源，提升大型语言模型在数学形式化方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学大型语言模型在自动形式化方面表现不佳，主要受限于缺乏大规模的非正式和正式语句对语料库。直接利用现有代码训练效果有限，因为代码和形式化数学在结构和语法上存在差异。

Method: TopoAlign 框架将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，然后将这些组件重组为结构上与形式化语句相似的对应物。这种结构对齐的代码数据可用于训练数学大型语言模型，无需额外的人工标注。

Result: 在 minif2f、Putnam 和 ProofNet 基准测试中，TopoAlign 显著提升了 DeepSeek-Math 的性能，在 BEq@10 上提高了 17.77%，在 typecheck@10 上提高了 68.82%。即使对于 Herald 这种专业模型，在 BEq@10 和 typecheck@10 上分别实现了 0.12% 和 1.09% 的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，即使不引入新的数学知识，训练对齐的代码数据也有助于提升数学大型语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4)
mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of
transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation
helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which
enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the
performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale
corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements.
Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language
instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal
mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a
framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources
for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and
dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that
structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code
data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human
annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and
evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign
provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%
on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical
knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10
and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code
data is beneficial even for specialized models.

### [7] [GRAVITY: A Framework for Personalized Text Generation via Profile-Grounded Synthetic Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11952)
*Priyanka Dey,Daniele Rosa,Wenqing Zheng,Daniel Barcklow,Jieyu Zhao,Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAVITY：一个用于生成合成的、基于配置文件的偏好数据的框架，该框架集成了人口统计、文化和心理框架，以指导个性化内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对昂贵的人工注释的依赖，并捕捉更深层次的用户属性。

Method: 引入 GRAVITY 框架，通过整合人口统计、文化和心理框架（包括霍夫斯泰德文化维度、施瓦茨基本价值观、世界价值观调查和五大 OCEAN 特征）来合成偏好对。

Result: 在书籍描述生成任务中，GRAVITY 在多个文化背景下始终优于基线模型，偏好增益超过 4%，用户研究表明 GRAVITY 的输出在 86% 的情况下更受欢迎。

Conclusion: 基于场景的合成数据可以捕捉更丰富的用户差异，减少对昂贵注释的依赖，并生成更具吸引力的、以用户为中心的内容，为 LLM 个性化提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction
logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the
reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with
Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating
synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,
values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,
and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --
GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.
We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to
prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair
generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,
especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over
4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that
GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that
scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce
reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered
content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

### [8] [Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems on Unanswerable, Uncheatable, Realistic, Multi-hop Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11956)
*Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu,Bryan Li,Arman Cohan,William Gantt Walden,Eugene Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动生成难以作弊、现实、无法回答和多跳查询（CRUMQs）的管道，用于评估RAG系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG基准测试很少反映多跳或超出范围问题的实际任务复杂性，这些问题通常可以通过不相关的推理来作弊，或者只需要简单的实际回忆。这限制了此类基准测试发现现有RAG系统的局限性的能力。

Method: 我们提出了第一个用于自动、难度可控的CRUMQs创建的管道，该管道适用于任何语料库和领域。

Result: 结果表明，与之前的RAG基准测试相比，CRUMQs对RAG系统具有很高的挑战性，并且在可作弊性得分方面降低了高达81.0%。

Conclusion: 我们的管道提供了一种简单的方法来提高基准测试的难度和真实性，并推动更强大的RAG系统的开发。

Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which
relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these
settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries
and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this,
existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop
or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected
reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only
simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover
limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first
pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of
un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable,
and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs),
adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over
two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark
experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to
prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve
up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline
offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive
development of more capable RAG systems.

### [9] [Direct Multi-Token Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11958)
*Xuan Luo,Weizhi Wang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为直接多Token解码（DMTD）的新的推理范式，旨在提高大型语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的不同层可能扮演不同的角色，并且中间层的输出可能包含足够的信息，从而无需重复遍历早期和中间层。

Method: 利用早期和中间层处理后的隐藏状态，仅使用后期层生成多个token。

Result: 微调后的DMTD Qwen3-4B模型在有限数据集上实现了高达2倍的加速，性能损失很小。随着训练数据集的增大，性能有望进一步提高。

Conclusion: DMTD是一种有前景的加速大型语言模型推理的方法，它不需要额外的参数、辅助程序或生成后验证。

Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large
language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest
that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct
roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers
handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract
representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations
have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states
may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple
tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse
the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct
Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces
no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification.
Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model
has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with
only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its
performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

### [10] [Scaling Long-Horizon LLM Agent via Context-Folding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11967)
*Weiwei Sun,Miao Lu,Zhan Ling,Kang Liu,Xuesong Yao,Yiming Yang,Jiecao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Context-Folding框架通过允许智能体主动管理其工作上下文来解决大型语言模型（LLM）智能体在长时程任务中受上下文长度限制的问题。智能体可以程序化地分支成子轨迹来处理子任务，然后在完成后折叠它，从而在保留结果的简洁摘要的同时，折叠中间步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）智能体在长时程任务中受到上下文长度的根本限制。

Method: Context-Folding，一种允许智能体主动管理其工作上下文的框架。为了使这种行为可学习，我们开发了一个端到端强化学习框架FoldGRPO，该框架具有特定的过程奖励，以鼓励有效的任务分解和上下文管理。

Result: 在复杂的长时程任务（深度研究和SWE）中，我们的折叠智能体与ReAct基线相匹配或优于ReAct基线，同时使用的活动上下文小10倍，并且显着优于依赖于基于总结的上下文管理的模型。

Conclusion: Context-Folding框架通过允许智能体主动管理其工作上下文，有效解决了大型语言模型智能体在长时程任务中受上下文长度限制的问题，并在复杂任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context
length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that
empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can
procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it
upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise
summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process
rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On
complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches
or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$
smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based
context management.

### [11] [Conjecturing: An Overlooked Step in Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11986)
*Jasivan Alex Sivakumar,Philipp Borchert,Ronald Cardenas,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了自动形式化中被忽视的猜想环节，发现现有模型在考虑猜想的情况下，自动形式化的性能被高估了。论文提出了Lean-FIRe方法来改进猜想和自动形式化，并在PutnamBench问题上取得了进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在自动形式化方面表现不佳，并且对它们的猜想能力的评估有限，因此难以理解其影响。许多数学问题在没有首先猜想结论（例如显式答案或特定界限）的情况下无法直接形式化。

Method: 论文通过增强现有数据集创建了ConjectureBench，并重新设计了评估框架和指标，专门用于衡量LLM的猜想能力，既作为一个独立的任务，又在自动形式化流程中进行衡量。此外，论文还设计了一种推理时方法Lean-FIRe来改进猜想和自动形式化。

Result: 对包括GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1在内的基础模型的评估表明，当在评估期间考虑猜想时，它们的自动形式化性能被大大高估了。使用Lean-FIRe方法，GPT-4.1成功地完成了13个PutnamBench问题的端到端自动形式化，DeepSeek-V3.1完成了7个。

Conclusion: LLM拥有生成准确猜想的必要知识，但提高自动形式化性能需要将猜想视为一项独立任务，并进一步研究如何将其正确地整合到自动形式化中。未来的研究应该侧重于改进猜想，这是一个被忽视的形式数学推理步骤。

Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in
formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,
however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical
problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion
such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their
conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or
proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this
gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the
evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing
capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation
pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is
substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during
evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We
design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and
autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first
successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1
and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite
knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation
performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and
investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.
Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward
improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

*Ryan Shea,Yunan Lu,Liang Qiu,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的用户模拟框架SAGE，用于评估多轮交互代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法通常模拟通用用户，忽略了捕获真实行为所需的领域特定原则。因此，需要更贴近实际业务场景的用户模拟方法。

Method: SAGE集成了来自业务背景的知识，包括理想客户画像和业务代理基础设施（如产品目录、FAQ和知识库）。

Result: SAGE 能够生成更真实和多样化的交互，并且能够识别出高达 33% 的代理错误。

Conclusion: SAGE 是一种有效的评估工具，可以支持缺陷查找和迭代代理改进。

Abstract: Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for
human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an
alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and
overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior.
We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent
Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates
top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles,
grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate
bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product
catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate
interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a
company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this
approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also
identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an
evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

### [13] [Generate Logical Equivalence Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12001)
*Xinyu Wang,Haoming Yu,Yicheng Yang,Zhiyuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种自动生成离散数学逻辑等价问题的方法，以解决在线教学中抄袭问题，并提供大量练习题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教学中抄袭现象日益严重，而自动问题生成（AQG）可以通过为每个学生创建独特的问题来缓解抄袭问题。此外，AQG 还可以提供大量的练习题。

Method: 该方法使用形式语言定义逻辑等价问题，并将该语言转换为两组生成规则，并开发了一种线性时间算法来生成问题。

Result: 实验表明，该系统生成的问题的准确性与教科书问题相当，难度也与教科书问题相似。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的AQG系统能够生成高质量的逻辑等价问题，可以有效缓解抄袭问题并提供大量练习题。

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet
plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and
learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to
mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally,
AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on
generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a
foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature
review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all
propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies
and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new
approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language,
translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a
linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two
experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions
generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these
questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment
assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions,
textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The
results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of
textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究对比了神经符号系统和基于大型语言模型的IE系统在农业领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前信息抽取领域过度依赖大型语言模型的趋势，以及忽略传统符号或统计IE系统经验的问题。

Method: 在猪肉、奶制品和作物子领域的九次访谈中，评估神经符号系统和基于LLM的IE系统。

Result: 基于LLM的系统优于神经符号系统(F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2)。神经符号系统运行速度更快，控制性更强，在无上下文任务中具有较高的准确性，但缺乏泛化性，难以处理上下文细微差别，并且需要大量资源来开发和维护。基于llm的系统实现了更高的性能，更快的部署和更容易的维护，但运行速度较慢，控制有限，模型依赖和幻觉风险。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在实际应用中部署NLP系统的“隐藏成本”，强调需要在性能、效率和控制之间取得平衡。

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on
large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building
symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS)
and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine
interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system
outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where
total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details.
However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime,
greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks
generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant
resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher
performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime,
limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings
highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world
applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and
control.

*Jung-Woo Shim,Yeong-Joon Ju,Ji-Hoon Park,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为 Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR) 的即插即用框架，用于改进大型语言模型 (LLM) 中由于结构不良或模糊的提示而导致的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 虽然在生成回复方面表现出色，但有时会产生看似合理但不正确的“幻觉”事实，从而降低了信任度。一个常见但经常被忽视的原因是用户使用了结构不良或模糊的提示，导致 LLM 基于假设而非实际意图进行回复。

Method: 该框架通过以下方式纠正提示：1) 清理结构不良的提示；2) 生成额外的、信息丰富的任务描述，以对齐用户意图和提示，使用微调的小型语言模型。

Result: CPR 显著提高了生成质量，同时减轻了幻觉。

Conclusion: 实证研究表明，应用 CPR 的提示比没有应用 CPR 的原始提示的胜率超过 90%，且无需任何外部知识。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency
in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes
generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A
frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly
structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed
rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these
ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a
plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans
ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions
to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small
language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR
significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating
hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves
over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

*Jung-Woo Shim,Yeong-Joon Ju,Ji-Hoon Park,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为多阶段提示改进 (MPR) 的框架，旨在通过系统地改进不良提示来减少大型语言模型 (LLM) 中的幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在自然语言理解和生成任务中表现出强大的性能。然而，LLM 在幻觉方面仍然面临挑战，模型会生成看似合理但不正确的信息。虽然有几个因素会导致幻觉，但措辞含糊、语法不正确或信息不完整的提示的影响尚未得到充分探讨。

Method: 我们引入了多阶段提示改进 (MPR)，这是一个旨在跨多个阶段系统地改进这些不良提示的框架。每个阶段都使用针对这些任务进行微调的小型语言模型 (SLM) 来解决标点符号、印刷错误和关键术语误用等特定错误。 MPR 通过额外的上下文迭代地增强提示的清晰度，并采用带有排名的自我反思机制来优先考虑最相关的输入。

Result: 在幻觉基准测试中进行的实验结果表明，与原始形式相比，MPR 改进的提示实现了超过 85% 的获胜率，证明了其在减少幻觉和提高 LLM 输出准确性方面的有效性。有趣的是，我们发现 MPR 可以与现有的事后幻觉缓解框架相结合，进一步增强其多功能性。

Conclusion: MPR 提供了一种轻量级且适应性强的解决方案，可增强各种领域中 LLM 的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However,
LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models
generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute
to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous
wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under
explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a
framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across
multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation,
typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models
(SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of
prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with
ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on
hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\%
win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we
reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation
frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and
adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

Conclusion: HLV训练方法对模型公平性有积极影响。

Abstract: The impact of human label variation (HLV) on model fairness is an unexplored

TL;DR: 本论文概述了大型语言模型 (LLM) 中的不确定性量化 (UQ) 方法，重点关注幻觉检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易产生看似合理但事实不正确的输出，因此在实际应用中的可靠性和可信度令人担忧。

Method: 论文系统地介绍了不确定性量化的基础知识，并考察了它在幻觉检测中的作用。对现有方法进行了分类，并给出了代表性方法的实验结果。

Result: 论文概述了LLM中不确定性量化的当前情况，用于幻觉检测。

Conclusion: 论文讨论了当前的局限性，并概述了有希望的未来研究方向，从而更清晰地展示了LLM UQ在幻觉检测中的应用前景。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide
range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text
summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised
concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to
hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to
address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the
trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations
of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between
epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have
been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of
UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a
mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We
systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple
dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches.
Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research
directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for
hallucination detection.

*Ruibo Chen,Jiacheng Pan,Heng Huang,Zhenheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种prompt重写框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）来优化prompt，从而提升文图生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文图生成模型在处理简单或不明确的prompt时效果不佳，导致图像-文本对齐、美观性和质量欠佳。

Method: 该方法引入了精心设计的奖励系统和迭代直接偏好优化（DPO）训练流程，使重写器能够在不需要监督微调数据的情况下增强prompt。

Result: 实验结果表明，该prompt重写器能够持续提升图像-文本对齐、视觉质量和美观性，优于强大的基线模型。此外，该方法具有很强的可迁移性，在一个文图生成骨干网上训练的prompt重写器可以有效地推广到其他骨干网，而无需重新训练。性能增益随用作重写器的大型LLM容量的扩展而扩展。

Conclusion: Prompt重写是一种有效的、可扩展的、实用的、模型无关的策略，可用于改进文图生成系统。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified
prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.
We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our
approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct
preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to
enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our
method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt
rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and
aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone
generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also
systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with
the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight
that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic
strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained
prompt rewriters soon.

### [20] [Hierarchical Alignment: Surgical Fine-Tuning via Functional Layer Specialization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12044)
*Yukun Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM对齐方法，称为分层对齐，该方法针对模型不同功能块的层进行有针对性的DPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM对齐技术通常将模型视为一个整体，忽略了Transformer架构中的功能专业化。

Method: 将模型层分为局部（语法）、中间（逻辑）和全局（事实性）三个功能块，并应用有针对性的DPO。

Result: 结果表明，对齐局部层可以提高语法流畅性，对齐全局层可以提高事实一致性和逻辑连贯性，并且所有分层策略都成功避免了标准DPO中观察到的“对齐税”。

Conclusion: 分层对齐是一种更高效、可控和可解释的模型对齐方法，具有构建更高级和可靠的LLM的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic
entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach
overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,
where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to
abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm
by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO
to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate
(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for
surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,
demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning
the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly,
aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency
as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing
logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical
strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO,
where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These
findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable
path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from
monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more
advanced and reliable LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为APCE的上下文感知方法，用于选择最重要的输入块，以提高长文本摘要任务中长上下文Transformer模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文Transformer模型面临着内存占用增加和ContextRot现象两个关键挑战，这些挑战会降低模型性能。

Method: APCE通过低维语义相似性匹配来选择最重要的输入块。

Result: 实验结果表明，与完整密集基线相比，APCE使用一小部分输入序列（50%-70%）实现了卓越或相当的摘要性能，从而提高了KV缓存和自注意力内存效率。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果为LCTM的上下文感知效率解决方案提供了进一步的研究方向。

Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing
two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic
self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length
increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that
transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length.
Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we
surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to
synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the
ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative
for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware
solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional
semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on
the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA
environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment
systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par
summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a
fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and
self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire
further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards
other relevant long-context tasks.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在精神健康紧急情况下表现不佳。本文评估了Verily行为健康安全过滤器(VBHSF)在两个数据集上的性能，并与OpenAI和NVIDIA的guardrails进行了比较。VBHSF表现出优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在精神健康紧急情况下常常给出有害或不恰当的建议。

Method: 使用包含1,800条模拟消息的Verily精神健康危机数据集和NVIDIA Aegis AI内容安全数据集（包含794条精神健康相关消息）评估VBHSF。与OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest和NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails进行比较分析。

Result: VBHSF在Verily精神健康危机数据集v1.0上表现出均衡的性能，对任何精神健康危机的检测都具有较高的敏感性（0.990）和特异性（0.992），F1-score为0.939。在NVIDIA Aegis AI内容安全数据集2.0上，VBHSF性能保持高敏感性（0.982）和准确性（0.921），但特异性降低（0.859）。

Conclusion: VBHSF表现出稳健、通用的性能，优先考虑敏感性以最大限度地减少遗漏的危机，这对于医疗保健应用至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering
harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study
evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets:
the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and
the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental
health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we
evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out
comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation
guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF
demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis
Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in
detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939,
sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in
identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis
AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive
(0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared
with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF
demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving
significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher
specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni
Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest
exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with
sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF
demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to
minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PACE的LLM创造力评估方法，通过生成并行关联链来评估创造力，降低了数据污染的风险，并提供了高效的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM的创造力是一个重要的研究领域，但数据污染和昂贵的人工评估阻碍了进展。

Method: 要求LLM生成并行关联链，通过评估这些链的创造力来评估LLM的创造力。

Result: PACE与Chatbot Arena创意写作排名有很强的相关性(Spearman's ρ = 0.739, p < 0.001)，并且高性能的LLM的分数与普通人的表现相当，但专业人士的表现始终优于LLM。

Conclusion: 语言分析表明，人类和LLM都表现出关联具体性降低的趋势，并且人类表现出更大的关联模式多样性。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain,
though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often
impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we
propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate
their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a
straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong
correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho =
0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A
comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals
that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human
performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore,
linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of
decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a
greater diversity of associative patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言领域自适应方法在跨语言知识获取机制方面研究不足，导致在低资源环境下表现欠佳。

Method: 提出了AdaXEval自适应评估方法，该方法从用于训练的同一双语领域语料库构建多项选择QA数据集，并通过持续训练LLM来跟踪其获取领域知识的方式。

Result: 在13B英语-日语双语LLM上的实验表明，尽管有高质量的双语语料库，跨语言迁移仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了多语言领域自适应中领域知识从训练数据到知识的转化机制，并强调了跨语言迁移的挑战。

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain
knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many
methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of
multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a
language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work
examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA
studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge
coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds
multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for
training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through
continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire
domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from
domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese
bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a
high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语音语言模型(LSLM)在对话生成方面表现出色，但在语义理解方面不如传统pipeline系统。通过实验发现，LSLM在语音-文本对齐训练后损失了一些文本输入性能，但语音和文本输入之间的性能差距更加明显，即模态差距。通过对粗粒度和细粒度的文本和语音表示的分析，发现深层中语音和文本的表示在方向上对齐，但在幅度上发散。token-level的对齐模式与模态差距密切相关。通过角度投影和长度归一化等方法，可以改善语音输入的正确性。

Motivation: 研究LSLM在语音和文本输入上存在性能差距（模态差距）的原因。

Method: 通过系统实验，分析粗粒度和细粒度的文本和语音表示，并提出Alignment Path Score来量化token-level的对齐质量。

Result: 发现深层中语音和文本的表示在方向上对齐，但在幅度上发散，且token-level的对齐模式与模态差距密切相关。通过角度投影和长度归一化等方法，可以改善语音输入的正确性。

Conclusion: 对LSLM中的模态差距和对齐机制进行了首次系统的实证分析，为未来的优化提供了理论和方法指导。

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive
conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional
pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal
through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input
performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between
speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality
gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and
speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech
and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction
(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean
distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly
correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous
token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is
observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify
token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the
modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on
critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These
strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.
Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap
and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological
guidance for future optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了SafeMT基准，用于评估多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)在多轮对话中的安全性问题，发现模型在多轮对话中更容易受到攻击，并提出了对话安全调节器以提高安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试没有充分考虑多轮对话中MLLM的安全性问题，而多轮对话在日常交互中更为常见，风险更高。

Method: 构建了SafeMT基准，包含10,000个样本，涵盖17种不同的场景和四种jailbreak方法。提出了安全指数(SI)来评估对话过程中MLLM的安全性。还提出了一个对话安全调节器，用于检测对话中隐藏的恶意意图，并为MLLM提供相关的安全策略。

Result: 评估了17个模型的安全性，发现随着有害对话轮数的增加，模型成功受到攻击的风险也会增加。实验结果表明，所提出的调节器比现有的防御模型更有效地减少了多轮ASR。

Conclusion: 多模态大型语言模型在对话交互中的安全机制不足，提出的对话安全调节器能够有效提高安全性。

Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety
issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more
common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;
however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To
encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in
multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues
of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This
benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different
scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index
(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess
the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of
successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful
dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these
models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We
propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent
concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety
policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that
this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed
guard models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer模型的Softmax函数会产生“人工确定性”，导致LLM出现幻觉。Credal Transformer通过Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) 解决这个问题，CAM基于证据理论，用“credal set”代替单一注意力向量，credal set的大小衡量了模型的不确定性。当证据不足时，产生一个扩散分布，代表模糊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM) 会产生幻觉，生成不正确的陈述。这是由于Transformer的Softmax函数造成的。

Method: 用基于证据理论的Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) 替代标准注意力。CAM产生一个“credal set”，而不是单一的注意力向量，集合的大小直接衡量模型的不确定性。将注意力分数重新概念化为狄利克雷分布的证据质量：足够的证据恢复标准注意力，而不足的证据产生一个扩散分布，代表模糊性。

Result: Credal Transformer可以识别超出分布的输入，量化模糊性，并通过拒绝回答来显著减少对无法回答问题的自信错误。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的架构来减轻幻觉，并提供了一种将不确定性量化直接集成到模型中的设计范例，为更可靠的AI奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet
confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax
function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous
attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty
information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,
which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based
on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions)
instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring
model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as
evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers
standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,
representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies
out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces
confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a
new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that
integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a
foundation for more reliable AI.

Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), parallel
reasoning has emerged as a new inference paradigm that enhances reasoning
robustness by concurrently exploring multiple lines of thought before
converging on a final answer. It has become a significant trend to explore
parallel reasoning to overcome the fragility of standard sequential methods and
improve practical performance. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize
the progress and challenges of parallel reasoning. We first present a formal
definition of parallel reasoning and clarify its distinction from related
concepts like Chain-of-Thought. Then, we organize and discuss advanced
techniques based on a novel taxonomy, including non-interactive reasoning,
interactive reasoning, and efficiency-focused decoding strategies.
Additionally, we explore various application scenarios, such as solving complex
problems and enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.Finally, we highlight the
core challenges of parallel reasoning and suggest potential directions for
future research. We hope that our work can provide a useful roadmap for
beginners and encourage more research on improving parallel reasoning methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在大语言模型中，通过结合过程或结果奖励模型（PRM 或 ORM）重新排序的多次样本生成，是否可以成功地应用于连续空间的推理。发现这种方法在连续空间中面临独特的挑战，主要是因为缺乏关键的归纳偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究连续空间推理中，离散空间中有效的技术是否仍然有效。

Method: 使用基于 dropout 抽样的 COCONUT 连续空间推理 LM 生成不同的推理路径，并进行 Pass@N 分析。

Result: 通过 Pass@N 分析揭示了性能提升的潜力，但发现数据生成和训练 PRM/ORM 模型的方法在连续空间中只能带来边际改进。几何属性和轨迹动态的探测表明，正确和不正确的推理之间缺乏有效的区分。

Conclusion: 连续推理 LM 的训练框架不仅需要优化准确性，还需要明确地结合归纳偏置，以便在推理时区分正确和不正确的想法。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with
Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective
for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates
whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in
the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space
reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating
diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on
the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant
gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we
highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous
thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training
PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in
the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric
properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that
prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning
(essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that
current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous
thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous
reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly
incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for
discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data
will be publicly available.}

TL;DR: LLaDR: 利用大型语言模型增强知识图谱，以实现更有效的药物重用，并在阿尔茨海默病等案例中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物重用方法忽略了生物医学知识图谱中常见的常识性概念知识，如某些药物与特定治疗不相容的机制先验知识。

Method: 提出LLaDR框架，通过从大型语言模型中提取的语义丰富的治疗相关文本表示来改进知识图谱中生物医学概念的表示，并使用这些表示来微调知识图谱嵌入（KGE）模型。

Result: 实验表明，LLaDR在不同场景中实现了最先进的性能，并且在阿尔茨海默病案例研究中进一步证实了其稳健性和有效性。

Conclusion: LLaDR通过将治疗相关知识注入KGE，极大地改进了生物医学概念的表示，增强了对研究不足或复杂适应症的语义理解。

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,
especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),
which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support
this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical
concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating
that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To
address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework
for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts
within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related
textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models
(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By
injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the
representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of
under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different
scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its
robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: 大型音频语言模型在定位事件发生时间方面存在偏差，预测的时间戳与实际时间戳存在系统性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型越来越多地应用于音频理解和多模态推理，但它们定位事件发生时间的能力仍未被充分探索。这项研究旨在系统地研究 LALM 中的时间偏差。

Method: 通过在带时间戳的数据集上进行受控实验，并使用时间偏差指数 (TBI) 来量化预测事件时序中的系统性偏差。

Result: 时间偏差普遍存在于数据集和模型中，随着音频长度的增加而增加，并且因事件类型和位置而异。

Conclusion: 目前的大型音频语言模型存在根本性局限，需要开发时间鲁棒性架构。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio
understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events
occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal
bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For
example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key
formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or
later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped
datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and
models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds
in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We
quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic
misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization
framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and
call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）和直接偏好优化（DPO）的语音分割框架，以提高同声传译的质量和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音分割模型受限于监督学习目标，未能充分考虑人类偏好对齐，这对于自然的实时翻译至关重要。

Method: 使用DPO训练大型语言模型，使其能够预测更符合实时翻译需求的自然分割点。

Result: 在ACL 60/60语料库上，该方法在三个语言对上均优于SHAS，并在翻译质量（BLEU，COMET）和延迟（Average Lagging）方面取得了一致的改进。

Conclusion: 基于偏好调整的LLM有潜力超越现有的预训练分割模型，并推进自适应的、与人类对齐的同声传译。

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance
translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced
pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic
rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more
robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning
objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial
for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation
framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs
to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of
real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across
three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2
as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM
achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent
improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average
Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct
comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to
surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,
human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM公平性评估框架，该框架能根据真实场景和危害程度来评估LLM的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估缺乏真实场景的基础，并且没有考虑危害程度的差异。

Method: 引入了HALF框架，该框架将九个应用领域组织成三个层级（严重、中等、轻微），使用五阶段流程。

Result: 对八个LLM的评估结果表明，LLM在不同领域并不总是一致公平；模型大小或性能并不能保证公平性；推理模型在医疗决策支持方面表现更好，但在教育方面表现更差。

Conclusion: HALF揭示了之前基准测试的成功与部署准备之间的明显差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact
domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and
education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical.
However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not
account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery
should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To
address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a
deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications
and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application
domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline.
Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not
consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not
guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision
support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap
between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在微调过程中表现出类似人类的偏见，但其具体机制尚不明确。本研究调查了著名的Knobe效应（一种道德偏见）是否出现在微调后的LLM中，并尝试追踪其来源。通过层修补分析，发现这种偏见不仅在微调期间学习到，而且还存在于特定层中。通过将预训练模型的激活值修补到几个关键层中，可以消除这种效应，而无需重新训练模型。研究结果表明，可以通过有针对性的干预来解释、定位和减轻LLM中的社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型(LLMs)在微调过程中内化人类偏见的机制，特别是道德偏见（Knobe效应）。

Method: 对3个开源LLM进行层修补分析，以确定Knobe效应是否出现以及它是否可以追溯到模型的特定组件。

Result: 发现Knobe效应不仅在微调期间被学习，而且定位于特定层。将预训练模型的激活值修补到几个关键层中足以消除这种效应。

Conclusion: LLM中的社会偏见可以通过有针对性的干预来解释、定位和减轻，而无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases
during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain
unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a
moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether
it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a
Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the
bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set
of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the
corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in
LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted
interventions, without the need for model retraining.

*Jiakai Li,Rongzheng Wang,Yizhuo Ma,Shuang Liang,Guangchun Luo,Ke Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS), a plug-and-play solution to improve LLMs on multi-document question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-range dependency modeling and the 'lost-in-the-middle' issue in multi-document QA, and current solutions are either incomplete or costly.

Method: DSAS contains Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) to address the 'lost-in-the-middle' issue and Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS) to enhance focus on critical paragraphs.

Result: DSAS improves performance on multi-document QA tasks across mainstream LLMs, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 4.2% on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct.

Conclusion: DSAS is an effective, robust, and scalable solution for improving LLMs in multi-document QA without requiring architectural modifications or extra training.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various
fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question
answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency
modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which
weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the
''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information
in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global
dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and
simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose
Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The
Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by
assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and
position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)
module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information
exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in
long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play
solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across
mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score
improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of
both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix
further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为MedQA-Followup的框架，用于评估大型语言模型在多轮医疗问答中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估框架通常在理想条件下评估单轮问答，忽略了医疗咨询的复杂性，例如相互冲突的输入、误导性上下文和权威影响。

Method: 该方法区分了浅层鲁棒性（抵抗误导性初始上下文）和深层鲁棒性（在答案受到质疑时保持准确性），同时引入了间接-直接轴，将上下文框架（间接）与显式建议（直接）分开。

Result: 在MedQA数据集上评估了五个最先进的LLM，发现模型在浅层扰动下表现良好，但在多轮设置中表现出严重的漏洞，Claude Sonnet 4的准确率从91.2%降至13.5%。

Conclusion: 多轮鲁棒性是医疗LLM安全可靠部署的关键但未被充分探索的维度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical
use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains
poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn
question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of
medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and
authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for
systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.
Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading
initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are
challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that
separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).
Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under
shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn
settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude
Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often
more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across
models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.
Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing
additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others
partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn
robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable
deployment of medical LLMs.

*Zeyu Zhao,Ningtao Wang,Xing Fu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chinese ModernBERT是一个从头开始训练的中文encoder，它在准确率、速度和内存效率方面都很有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的encoder改进没有完全转移到中文上，因为中文的分词和形态与英文有明显的不同。

Method: 该模型耦合了：(i) 一个硬件感知的32k BPE词汇表，专门为常见的中文词缀/复合词定制；(ii) 全词掩码（WWM）与动态掩码课程；(iii) 一个两阶段的预训练管道，使用RoPE和交替的局部/全局注意力将原生上下文从1,024个tokens扩展到8,192个tokens；(iv) 一个阻尼余弦学习率计划。

Result: 在CLUE上，Chinese ModernBERT在统一的微调协议下与强大的中文encoders竞争。在SimCLUE测试集上达到了0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman)。

Conclusion: Chinese ModernBERT在SimCLUE上超过了Qwen-0.6B-embedding，表明了STS与额外策划pairs的清晰扩展路径。

Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,
data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory
efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where
tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese
ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware
32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the
embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking
curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)
a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to
8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a
damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We
pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and
Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong
Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves
high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,
reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe
retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:
fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking
(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.
Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding
on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated
pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible
research.

Result: 使用 OpenAI API 通过 GPT-5，我们在不到 60 小时内注释了来自美国历史英语语料库 (COHA) 的 143,933 个句子，在两个复杂的注释程序上实现了 98% 以上的准确率。

Conclusion: LLM 可以在minimal的人工干预下大规模地执行一系列数据准备任务，为基于语料库的研究开辟了新的可能性，尽管实施需要注意成本、许可和其他道德考虑因素。

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual
annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic
work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline
for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large
language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches,
our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc
evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate
the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study
of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the
OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two
sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform
a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,
opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation
requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

Motivation: 现有反击言论生成工作主要基于大型语言模型或非政府组织专家，存在可靠性和连贯性有限以及可扩展性不足的问题。

Method: 该框架集成了先进的检索增强生成（RAG）管道，并构建了一个包含32,792个文本的知识库，涵盖联合国数字图书馆、EUR-Lex和欧盟基本权利署。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在标准指标和人工评估方面均优于标准大型语言模型基线和竞争方法。

Conclusion: 该框架和知识库为研究仇恨言论及其他领域中可信和健全的反击言论生成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as
fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work
treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on
Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks
due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text,
and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel
framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation
process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main
target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people
of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons,
and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library,
EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792
texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality
of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM)
and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard
LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting
framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and
sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

Conclusion: 这项工作提高了我们对LLM如何与人类语言处理相关的理解，并突出了BA和NWP之间特征依赖性的差异。

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language
processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify
the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to
study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the
relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our
findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP
exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA
prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted
recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to
human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance
between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly
applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse
language processing tasks.

Conclusion: MoBiLE 是一种有效的 MoE 推理框架，可在保证模型质量的前提下提高推理速度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional
performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse
activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active
experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU
DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by
the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,
existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.
These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using
specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered
by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on
recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE
inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the
number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while
maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.
Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for
switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We
evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging
generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to
1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible
degradation in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在学术研究和评审中的双重角色，以及由此带来的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是LLMs被广泛应用于学术工作流程，但其在研究和评审中的复杂相互作用带来的风险尚未被充分探索。

Method: 通过模拟，研究使用LLMs作为评审者可能对学术公平造成的影响。模拟包括生成和修改论文的研究代理，以及评估提交内容的评审代理。通过模拟结果和人工标注，识别LLM评审与人类判断之间的显著错位。

Result: LLM评审者系统性地提高LLM撰写的论文的分数，并且持续低估包含批评性陈述的人类撰写的论文。LLM评审者存在两种主要偏见：偏爱LLM生成的写作风格的语言特征偏见，以及对批评性陈述的反感。

Conclusion: 如果在没有充分谨慎的情况下在同行评审周期中部署LLMs，可能会对人类作者和学术研究构成风险和公平问题。另一方面，LLM评审指导的修订可以在LLM和人类评估中产生质量提升，说明LLMs作为评审者对于早期研究人员和提高低质量论文的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow,
potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous
studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review,
their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between
research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this
study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and
research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential
risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a
research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,
which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct
human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based
reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores
for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than
human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored
papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple
revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM
reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and
an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and
equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are
deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand,
revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human
evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for
early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.

### [43] [Tokenization Disparities as Infrastructure Bias: How Subword Systems Create Inequities in LLM Access and Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12389)
*Hailay Kidu Teklehaymanot,Wolfgang Nejdl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前的大语言模型（LLM）在处理不同语言时存在tokenization效率差异，这导致了计算资源分配的不公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了量化LLM中存在的计算不公平性，本文对200多种语言的tokenization效率进行了大规模的跨语言评估。

Method: 使用标准化的实验框架，对所有语言样本进行一致的预处理和归一化，并通过tiktoken库进行统一的tokenization。使用Tokens Per Sentence (TPS)和Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC)等指标收集全面的tokenization统计数据，并以英语为基准进行比较。

Result: 研究发现，拉丁语系语言的tokenization效率较高，而非拉丁语系和形态复杂的语言的token膨胀率显著较高，通常RTC比率高出3-5倍。这些低效率导致计算成本增加，并降低了弱势语言的有效上下文利用率。

Conclusion: 目前的人工智能系统存在结构性不公平，低资源和非拉丁语系语言的使用者面临着不成比例的计算劣势。未来的研究应优先考虑开发语言敏感的tokenization策略和自适应词汇构建方法，从而确保更具包容性和计算公平性的多语言AI系统。

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable
access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations.
This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization
efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational
inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental
framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols,
followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all
language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using
established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and
Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our
cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities:
Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency,
while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly
greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These
inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced
effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the
findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers
of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational
disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of
linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary
construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more
inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

*Xiangjun Zai,Xingyu Tan,Xiaoyang Wang,Qing Liu,Xiwei Xu,Wenjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRoH: overcomes limitations of existing KH-based RAG methods using dynamic planning and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KH-based RAG methods suffer from static retrieval planning, non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop question answering.

Method: PRoH incorporates: (i) a context-aware planning module; (ii) a structured question decomposition process; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided reasoning path retrieval algorithm.

Result: PRoH achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation (G-E) score.

Conclusion: PRoH maintains strong robustness in long-range multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge
representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to
model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based
RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,
non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and
semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop
question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic
Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates
three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the
local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;
(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as
a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,
multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided
reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent
hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model
HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation
(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop
reasoning tasks.

*Linfeng Gao,Baolong Bi,Zheng Yuan,Le Wang,Zerui Chen,Zhimin Wei,Shenghua Liu,Qinggang Zhang,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为CLEAR的框架，用于解决RAG系统中模型回复与检索到的上下文证据不一致的问题。该框架通过将上下文分解为句子级的知识，利用隐藏状态探测来定位冲突知识，并引入冲突感知的微调来引导模型准确地整合检索到的证据，从而提高准确性和上下文的忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统存在不忠实的问题，模型的回复与检索到的上下文证据相矛盾。现有的改进上下文忠实性的方法主要依赖于外部干预，忽略了LLM如何在内部整合检索到的证据，特别是在知识冲突的情况下。

Method: 该论文通过对LLM中隐藏状态表示的探测分析，观察到知识整合是分层发生的，冲突表现为句子级别的潜在信号，并且不相关的上下文在与参数知识对齐时经常被放大。基于这些发现，论文提出了CLEAR框架，该框架包含三个步骤：（1）将上下文分解为细粒度的句子级知识；（2）采用隐藏状态探测来定位冲突知识；（3）引入冲突感知的微调来指导模型准确地整合检索到的证据。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的大量实验表明，CLEAR在准确性和上下文忠实性方面都得到了显著提高，并且在各种冲突条件下始终优于强大的基线。

Conclusion: CLEAR框架能够有效地提高RAG系统的准确性和上下文忠实性，通过分解上下文、定位冲突知识和冲突感知的微调，实现了在知识冲突条件下准确整合检索到的证据。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG
systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response
contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to
improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such
as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These
works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does
the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,
particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a
probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe
three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest
as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often
amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,
we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a
framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level
knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,
and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to
accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three
benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and
contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under
diverse conflict conditions. The related resources are available at

*Nikoleta Pantelidou,Evelina Leivada,Paolo Morosi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在形态泛化任务中表现出类似人类的准确性，但更多地依赖于训练数据的丰富程度，而非语言的结构复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在形态泛化任务中的表现，以评估其语言能力，并与人类表现进行对比。

Method: 使用多语言改编的Wug测试，在四种部分不相关的语言（加泰罗尼亚语、英语、希腊语和西班牙语）上测试了六个模型，并将结果与人类说话者进行比较。

Result: 模型能够将形态过程推广到未见过的词，并且准确性与人类相似。准确性模式与社区规模和数据可用性更密切相关，而不是与结构复杂性相关。

Conclusion: 模型行为主要由语言资源的丰富程度驱动，而不是对语法复杂性的敏感性，这种性能只是表面上类似于人类的语言能力。

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing
debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model
performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.
Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across
four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and
compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy
approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic
complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with
previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize
morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,
accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability
than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In
particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital
representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than
less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that
model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather
than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance
that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SMEC的训练框架，用于压缩LLM生成的高维嵌入，以减少计算复杂度和存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维嵌入增加了计算复杂度和存储需求，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 该框架引入了SMRL方法来减少训练期间的梯度方差，ADS模块来减少维度修剪期间的信息退化，以及S-XBM模块来增强高维和低维嵌入之间的无监督学习。

Result: 在图像、文本和多模态数据集上的实验表明，SMEC在保持性能的同时实现了显着的降维。在BEIR数据集上，该方法将压缩后的LLM2Vec嵌入（256维）的性能分别提高了1.1和2.7个点。

Conclusion: SMEC框架能够有效地压缩LLM嵌入，同时保持或提高其性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that
capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional
embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements,
thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression
(SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation
Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the
Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation
during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module
to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings.
Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC
achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance.
For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of
compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points
compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

Motivation: 随着全球探月活动的增加，高质量 3D 月球地图的需求变得越来越重要，尤其对于像 NASA 的 Endurance 任务这种长距离任务。

Method: 提出了一种通过减少压缩图像视差图中残余噪声来提高 3D 地图质量的方法。分析了 Kaguya TC 图像的压缩行为，并识别出系统性的视差噪声模式，尤其是在较暗区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效降低高程噪声，从而提高地形数据的安全性和可靠性，为未来的月球任务提供更好的保障。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法能够有效提升 Kaguya TC 图像生成的 3D 月球地图的质量，对未来月球任务的地形数据具有重要意义。

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP在视觉-语言模型(VLM)中作为视觉编码器优于DINO等自监督模型，但尚不清楚这种优势是源于CLIP的语言监督还是其更大的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解开这些因素，我们使用相同的架构、数据集和训练配置，在受控设置下预训练CLIP和DINO，从而获得相似的ImageNet准确率。

Method: 嵌入分析表明，CLIP捕获了高级语义(例如，对象类别、文本)，而DINO对颜色和样式等低级特征更敏感。当集成到vlm中并在20个VQA基准上进行评估时，CLIP在文本密集型任务中表现出色，而DINO在以视觉为中心的任务中略胜一筹。语言监督的变体(例如，sigmoid损失、预先训练的语言编码器)产生的收益有限。

Result: CLIP在文本密集型任务中表现出色，而DINO在以视觉为中心的任务中略胜一筹。语言监督的变体(例如，sigmoid损失、预先训练的语言编码器)产生的收益有限。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果为视觉编码器设计及其对VLM性能的影响提供了科学的见解。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

Conclusion: MammoDINO offers a scalable, annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis tools for mammogram.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our

placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

Motivation: 精确估计房间的3D布局在计算机视觉中至关重要，在机器人技术、增强现实和室内设计中具有潜在应用。

Method: 利用卷积神经网络(CNN)，并结合薄板样条(TPS)空间变换。PanoTPS-Net的架构分为两个阶段:首先，卷积神经网络从输入图像中提取高层特征，允许网络学习TPS变换的空间参数。其次，生成TPS空间变换层，根据预测的参数将参考布局弯曲到所需的布局。

Result: 在公开可用的数据集上进行的大量实验以及与最先进方法的比较证明了该方法的有效性。结果强调了该模型在房间布局估计中的准确性，并强调了TPS变换与全景图像之间的兼容性。该模型在处理长方体和非长方体房间布局估计方面的鲁棒性显而易见，在PanoContext、Stanford-2D3D、Matterport3DLayout和ZInD数据集上的3DIoU值分别为85.49、86.16、81.76和91.98。

Conclusion: 该模型在房间布局估计中表现出了准确性，并且在处理长方体和非长方体房间布局估计方面表现出了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,

Motivation: 现有模型过度依赖局部外观，缺乏明确的空间基础，难以推广到仓库等场景。

Method: 该方法通过将掩码维度以边界框坐标的形式嵌入到输入提示中，增强了空间理解能力，并使用特定于任务的监督在四个问题类别上微调框架。

Result: 该方法在公共排行榜上获得第四名，最终得分为73.0606。

Conclusion: 结果表明，结构化提示丰富和有针对性的优化在提升真实工业环境中的空间推理能力方面是有效的。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，该研究支持将ViTs可靠且可解释地集成到关键医疗诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为APGNet的自适应先验引导网络，用于检测水下环境中伪装物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的水下伪装物体检测方法在水下图像质量退化和海洋生物自然伪装方面面临挑战。

Method: 该方法结合了 Siamese 网络和一种新的先验引导机制。使用 MSRCR 算法进行数据增强，设计了扩展感受野（ERF）模块和多尺度渐进解码器（MPD），并提出了自适应先验引导机制，通过嵌入空间注意力和使用可变形卷积来融合位置和边界先验。

Result: 在两个公共 MAS 数据集上的实验结果表明，APGNet 优于 15 种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: APGNet 在水下伪装物体检测方面表现出色。

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的方法 VidMP3，可以生成保持原始运动的新视频，同时允许结构和语义的灵活性。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective

*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的QR码去模糊方法，该方法利用边缘先验知识，显著提高了严重模糊QR码的解码率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少明确利用QR码的结构化模式和锐利边缘的先验知识。

Method: 提出了边缘引导注意力块（EGAB），将显式边缘先验嵌入到Transformer架构中。基于EGAB，开发了边缘引导Restormer（EG-Restormer）网络。对于轻微模糊的输入，设计了轻量级高效网络（LENet）。将这两个网络集成到一个自适应双网络（ADNet）中。

Result: EG-Restormer和ADNet取得了最先进的性能，并具有竞争性的速度。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在QR码去模糊方面表现出色，尤其是在资源受限的移动设备上。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1: a multimodal LLM for on-demand, multi-turn web searches with dynamic query crafting for images and text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poor search queries when accessing external knowledge.

Method: A two-stage training pipeline: supervised finetuning and online reinforcement learning, using the DeepMMSearchVQA dataset.

Result: Superior performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach advances multimodal web-search.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

Method: 该方法利用平面结构的普遍性来导出精确的度量尺度深度图，并通过生成管道结合这种几何引导来改进可见性掩模估计，引导新颖的视图选择，并在使用视频扩散模型进行修复时增强多视图一致性，从而实现准确和一致的场景完成。

Result: 在Replica、ScanNet++和DeepBlending上的大量实验表明，该方法在几何和外观重建方面始终优于现有的基线，尤其是在未观察到的区域。

Conclusion: 该方法自然支持单视图输入和无姿势视频，在室内和室外场景中都具有很强的泛化能力，具有实际的现实世界适用性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有非排练类增量学习方法面临模型复杂性增加、表示不平滑以及阶段性优化与全局推理之间不一致的挑战。

Method: 提出了判别式表示学习 (DRL) 框架，该框架使用增量并行适配器 (IPA) 网络，该网络基于预训练模型 (PTM) 构建，并通过学习轻量级适配器来增量地增强模型。此外，设计了解耦锚点监督 (DAS)，通过将正样本和负样本分别与虚拟锚点进行比较来解耦它们的约束。

Result: 在六个基准测试中进行的大量实验表明，DRL 在整个 CIL 期间始终优于其他最先进的方法，同时在训练和推理阶段保持高效率。

Conclusion: DRL 框架有效地解决了非排练类增量学习中的挑战，并在性能和效率方面取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理局部伪影或面部颜色方面存在困难，因为它们依赖于显式的退化先验或全局统计指导。

Method: 该方法利用预训练扩散模型在弱指导下生成的伪参考人脸，这些伪标签具有结构对齐的轮廓和自然的颜色，通过分阶段监督实现区域特定修复：在整个去噪过程中应用结构指导，并在后续步骤中进行颜色细化，与扩散的粗到精性质相一致。通过结合面部解析图和划痕掩模，该方法选择性地恢复破损区域，同时避免身份不匹配。

Result: SSDiff 在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有的基于 GAN 和基于扩散的方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff 方法在旧照片人脸修复方面取得了显著的改进，并在 VintageFace 基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

Result: 实验结果表明，ImageSentinel可以有效地检测未经授权的数据集使用，同时保持授权应用程序的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageSentinel框架有效地解决了RAIG中图像数据集的保护问题。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

Motivation: 单光子相机在飞行时间3D成像中越来越受欢迎，但其性能受到硬件限制的影响，例如系统带宽、最大激光功率、传感器数据速率以及传感器内的存储和计算资源。现有的压缩直方图方法在实际照明硬件约束下表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地解决压缩单光子3D成像中硬件约束带来的问题，并在实际应用中表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

### [69] [Class-aware Domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission for Continual Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12150)
*Jiahuan Zhou,Chao Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为KFF的持续测试时自适应方法，该方法通过类感知领域知识融合与分裂，自适应地扩展和合并新旧领域的知识，以解决现有CTTA方法中新知识学习不足和历史知识干扰的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有CTTA方法通过恢复初始模型或重用历史模型来减少灾难性遗忘，但存在新知识学习不足和潜在有害历史知识干扰的问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 本文提出了一种类感知领域知识分裂（KFI）模块，用于分离新领域知识，并设计了一种领域知识融合（KFU）模块，用于将分裂的新知识合并到现有知识库中，同时采用了一种贪婪知识动态合并策略。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上的大量实验验证了本文提出方法相对于其他方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种有效的持续测试时自适应方法，通过知识融合与分裂，实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的单样本医学图像分割框架，通过扩散模型探索特征空间，生成多样且语义一致的原型变体，从而提高分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于原型的单样本医学图像分割方法依赖于确定性的特征平均，无法捕捉类内多样性，泛化能力差。

Method: 提出了扩散原型学习（DPL）框架，通过扩散过程将单样本原型转化为多样变体集合，并结合空间感知条件机制和保守融合策略，保证训练和推理的一致性。

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明DPL显著提高了单样本医学图像分割的性能，达到了新的state-of-the-art。

Conclusion: DPL通过扩散模型学习原型，有效提升了单样本医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

### [71] [State Space Prompting via Gathering and Spreading Spatio-Temporal Information for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12160)
*Jiahuan Zhou,Kai Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频理解方法，称为状态空间提示（SSP），通过结合帧内和帧间提示来聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练状态空间模型在视频分类中表现出巨大潜力，但顺序压缩的视觉提示token无法捕获视频中的空间和时间上下文信息，限制了空间和时间信息的有效传播。

Method: 设计了帧内聚集（IFG）模块和帧间传播（IFS）模块，分别用于聚集帧内空间关键信息和在不同帧之间传播时空信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的大量实验表明，SSP明显优于现有的SOTA方法，平均提高了2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP通过自适应地平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息，以互补的方式有效地传播视频中的判别信息。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Motivation: 为了实现高保真多模态3D重建。

Method: 该框架集成了CUDA加速的光栅化管线，可以同时渲染照片级逼真的RGB图像、几何精确的深度图、一致的表面法线和语义logits。重新设计了光栅化，通过可微射线-椭球相交来渲染深度，而不是使用高斯中心，从而可以通过解析深度梯度有效地优化旋转和比例属性。此外，还推导了表面法线渲染的解析梯度公式，确保重建的3D场景之间的几何一致性。为了提高计算和存储效率，引入了一个可学习的属性，该属性可以在训练期间对贡献最小的高斯进行可微修剪。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法在所有模态上都具有最先进的重建精度。

Conclusion: 验证了几何感知范例的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEEP3D: A box-supervised end-to-end pseudo-mask generation method for 3D instance segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully supervised 3D instance segmentation requires dense point-level annotations, which are costly. Box-level annotations are more scalable but introduce ambiguity in overlapping regions.

Method: A student-teacher framework with instance center-based query refinement and two novel consistency losses (query consistency loss and masked feature consistency loss).

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets.

Conclusion: BEEP3D is computationally efficient and effective for 3D instance segmentation with box-level supervision.

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法难以有效提取教师MLLM的视觉感知能力，并且之前的研究忽略了这个问题。通过系统分析，我们发现学生和老师之间的视觉注意力不一致是造成这个问题的主要原因。

Method: 我们提出了CompoDistill，通过显式地将学生的视觉注意力与老师的视觉注意力对齐来提高学生的视觉感知能力。

Conclusion: CompoDistill 具有有效性，并且具有更高级的骨干，突出了其泛化性。

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Conclusion: 结果表明，显式地建模时间相位信息非常重要，并为推进MER提出了一个有希望的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

Conclusion: 本文提出了改进的视觉语言推理数据集管理研究策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持并行token预测效率优势的同时，显著提高了生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Conclusion: 该方法在跨域红外小目标检测中有效。

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

Motivation: 现有的视频表示方法严重依赖不稳定的像素级匹配和跟踪，容易受到跟踪误差、遮挡和大运动的影响，导致视觉对象表示崩溃。

Method: 提出使用时空一致的代理节点来表示视频中动态变化的对象/场景。这些分层代理节点能够稳定地表达视觉对象的多尺度结构，并且其动态表示更新机制可以充分利用视频的时空先验知识来减轻不准确的跟踪器的影响。

Result: 该表示方法在视频重建方面取得了很高的精度，同时使用了更少的参数，并且支持复杂的视频处理任务，包括视频修复和基于关键帧的时序一致视频编辑。

Conclusion: 所提出的表示方法能够有效地处理视频中剧烈的场景和对象变化，并且具有可控和细粒度的外观编辑能力。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

Motivation: 由于隐私、伦理和昂贵的注释，医学图像存在数据稀缺的问题，因此需要稳健有效的训练目标。

Method: 乘法损失将交叉熵损失和Dice损失相乘，根据预测置信度动态调节梯度。置信度自适应乘法损失应用了受Focal Loss启发的置信度驱动的指数缩放，整合了预测概率和Dice系数，以强调困难样本。

Result: 在细胞和医学分割基准上的实验表明，我们的框架始终优于调整后的加性损失函数和现有的损失函数。

Conclusion: 该方法为具有挑战性的数据限制下的稳健分割提供了一种简单、有效且无超参数的机制。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

*Jinlun Ye,Zhuohao Sun,Yiqiao Qiu,Qiu Li,Zhijun Tan,Ruixuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的OOD检测方法，利用局部背景特征作为伪OOD特征进行模型训练，以解决神经网络模型在OOD数据上过度自信的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络模型在OOD数据上通常产生过度自信的预测，而已有方法存在数据收集和训练成本高的问题。

Method: 从ID图像中提取背景特征作为模拟的OOD视觉表示，并通过优化减少这些背景特征的L2范数来训练神经网络。

Result: 在多个标准OOD检测基准上进行了广泛的实验，证明了该方法的有效性及其与现有事后方法广泛的组合兼容性，并取得了新的state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够减轻神经网络在OOD数据上的过度自信问题，并在OOD检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于角度感知框架的可见光-红外图像融合方法 (AngularFuse)，旨在克服现有无监督方法在实际应用中面临的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于手工设计的损失函数，但这些损失函数存在明显局限性，例如参考图像缺乏细节和亮度不均，以及梯度损失仅关注梯度幅度。

Method: 1) 设计跨模态互补掩码模块，迫使网络学习模态间的互补信息; 2) 引入精细的参考图像合成策略，结合拉普拉斯边缘增强和自适应直方图均衡，生成具有更丰富细节和更平衡亮度的参考图像; 3) 引入角度感知损失，同时约束梯度域中的梯度幅度和方向。

Result: 在 MSRS, RoadScene, 和 M3FD 公共数据集上的综合实验表明，AngularFuse 明显优于现有的主流方法。

Conclusion: AngularFuse 能够确保融合图像保留纹理强度和正确的边缘方向，并在具有挑战性的场景中产生更清晰和更详细的结果，展示了卓越的融合能力。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

TL;DR: SpineBench is introduced to evaluate MLLMs on spine-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to assess MLLMs' performance in nuanced medical areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input.

Method: A new VQA benchmark, SpineBench, is created with 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images, covering 11 spinal diseases. It uses challenging hard negative options based on visual similarity.

Result: Evaluated 12 leading MLLMs on SpineBench, revealing poor performance in spinal tasks.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have limitations in the spine domain, guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

*Ying A,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的动态3D城市场景重建框架，在保证重建质量的同时，提高了训练和渲染速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在重建动态3D城市场景时，无法兼顾保真度和计算成本，因为它们对所有场景元素都同等对待。

Method: 引入了Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting (PAGS) 框架，将任务相关的语义优先级注入到3D重建和渲染流程中。PAGS包含语义引导的剪枝和正则化策略，以及优先级驱动的渲染管线。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明PAGS在安全关键对象上实现了卓越的重建质量，同时显著减少了训练时间，并将渲染速度提高到350 FPS以上。

Conclusion: PAGS 框架在动态3D城市场景重建中取得了很好的效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

*Jianfeng Dong,Lei Huang,Daizong Liu,Xianke Chen,Xun Yang,Changting Lin,Xun Wang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于部分相关视频检索（PRVR）的新框架，该框架从大型视觉语言预训练模型中提取泛化知识，并将其转移到轻量级的任务特定PRVR网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作理想地假设视频是预先修剪的，持续时间短，仅包含与文本相关的内容。然而，在实践中，视频通常是未修剪的，持续时间长，并且具有更复杂的背景内容。因此，本文侧重于更实用但具有挑战性的部分相关视频检索（PRVR）任务。

Method: 本文提出了一个具有动态知识蒸馏（DL-DKD++）的双重学习框架，其中大型教师模型为紧凑的双分支学生网络提供监督。学生模型包括两个分支：一个继承分支，吸收来自教师的可转移知识；一个探索分支，从PRVR数据集中学习特定于任务的信息，以解决领域差距。此外，还引入了一种动态软目标构建机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的模型在TVR、ActivityNet和Charades-STA数据集上实现了最先进的PRVR性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的框架，用于解决实际应用中更具挑战性的部分相关视频检索任务，并在三个数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型(VLM)在多模态推理方面取得了显著进展，但仍然容易出现幻觉，即输出结果并非基于视觉证据。本文研究了一种先前被忽视的场景：logo幻觉，即模型在logo不包含可见文字的情况下生成品牌名称或文本内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文研究了视觉语言模型中logo幻觉的问题，即模型在logo不包含可见文字的情况下生成品牌名称或文本内容。这种幻觉表明模型并非真正理解视觉信息，而是依赖于先验知识。

Method: 本文使用精心策划的纯符号、混合和文本logo数据集，以及具有挑战性的Hard-60子集，系统地测量了主流VLM中的幻觉现象。此外，通过九种结构化扰动来探测模型的鲁棒性。使用开放权重LLaVA的嵌入级别分析表明，幻觉与投影仪维度的一个小子集有关，并且有针对性的消融可以显著减少错误，同时保持OCR准确性。

Result: 研究结果表明，VLM通常依赖于符号先验知识，而不是真正的字形感知，特别是对于标志性的圆形logo。投影仪子空间在这种失败模式中起着决定性作用。有针对性的消融可以显著减少错误，同时保持OCR准确性。

Conclusion: 这项工作贡献了一种新的诊断方法和可操作的缓解措施，强调了投影仪解缠和OCR引导的解码是构建更值得信赖的多模态系统的有希望的方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

TL;DR: CurriFlow是一个新的语义占用预测框架，它结合了基于光流的时间对齐和课程指导的深度融合，以提高基于相机的3D语义场景完成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SSC方法依赖于时间堆叠或深度投影，通常缺乏明确的运动推理，并且难以处理遮挡和噪声深度监督。

Method: CurriFlow采用多层次融合策略，利用预训练的光流对齐跨帧的分割、视觉和深度特征，从而提高时间一致性和动态对象理解。为了增强几何鲁棒性，课程学习机制在训练期间逐渐从稀疏但精确的LiDAR深度过渡到密集但嘈杂的立体深度，从而确保稳定的优化和无缝适应实际部署。此外，来自Segment Anything Model (SAM)的语义先验提供了类别无关的监督，加强了体素级语义学习和空间一致性。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准测试中，CurriFlow实现了最先进的性能，平均IoU为16.9。

Conclusion: CurriFlow的运动引导和课程感知设计对于基于相机的3D语义场景完成是有效的。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决3D体积或视频分类任务中并非所有切片或帧都是必需的问题，因为它们存在固有的冗余。

Method: 提出了一种注意力引导的采样模块，该模块甚至可以在推理过程中适应输入。

Result: 在来自MedMNIST3D的3D医学成像数据集以及两个用于分类任务的超声视频数据集上证明了该方法的有效性，其中一个数据集是在真实临床条件下收集的具有挑战性的内部数据集。

Conclusion: 动态适应可以提高性能并降低深度神经网络模型的复杂性。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

Motivation: 现有模型仅依赖于检测单个视频帧中的装配对象状态，忽略了时间特征，导致模型鲁棒性和准确性受限，尤其是在对象被部分遮挡时。

Method: 该框架包含一个装配状态检测流和一个时空流，时空流包括一个空间编码器（使用一种新的弱监督方法进行预训练）和一个基于Transformer的时间编码器。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上评估，与现有方法相比，实际和预测装配步骤完成之间的平均延迟分别减少了11.2%和26.1%。

Conclusion: 时空流不依赖于对象的无遮挡视图来推断已完成的步骤，从而减少了延迟。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCR模型在3D视觉中表现出色，但当训练图像提供的多视图约束不足时，模型会退化。因此，需要改进SCR模型的训练方法。

Method: 论文提出了一种概率方法，通过注入高层次的重建先验来训练SCR模型。研究了多种先验，包括深度值分布的简单先验和通过大量室内扫描学习到的场景坐标配置先验。

Result: 在三个室内数据集上，这些先验帮助学习了更好的场景表示，生成了更连贯的场景点云，更高的配准率和更好的相机姿态。

Conclusion: 引入的先验知识能有效提升SCR模型的性能，并对下游任务（如新视角合成和相机重定位）产生积极影响。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Motivation: 目前城市基础设施监测依赖物联网传感器和人工检查，成本高、难以扩展，且与市民的直观感受不一致。VLM有望解决这些问题。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法，分析了2021年至2025年间发表的32篇同行评审研究。

Result: 研究回答了四个核心问题：VLM在哪些城市监测任务中有效？哪些VLM架构和框架最常用且性能优越？哪些数据集和资源支持该领域？VLM应用的评估方式和性能水平如何？

Conclusion: VLM在城市监测领域具有潜力，本综述旨在系统性地评估其作用。

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural
games.

*Suryaansh Jain,Umair Z. Ahmed,Shubham Sahai,Ben Leong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs are bad at identifying invalid outputs, leading to inflated reliability scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern application developers have to decide if they should switch to a new model. Human evaluation is costly and unscalable, and LLM-as-a-judge suffers from a critical flaw: LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias.

Method: An optimal minority-veto strategy that is resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. A novel regression-based framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of human-annotated ground truth data.

Result: Regression approach reduces the maximum absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs on a challenging code feedback task over 366 high-school Python programs.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias.

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一个整体代理排行榜（HAL），以应对AI代理评估中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理在现实世界的复杂任务中得到了发展，但AI代理评估面临许多挑战，削弱了我们对代理实际工作情况的理解。

Method: 1. 提供了一个标准化的评估工具，可以在数百个VM上协调并行评估，减少评估时间，同时消除常见的实现错误。2. 进行了跨模型、支架和基准的三维分析。3. 使用LLM辅助日志检查来发现以前未报告的行为。

Result: 通过进行21,730次代理rollout，涵盖9个模型和9个基准，发现在大多数运行中，更高的推理努力会降低准确性。发现了以前未报告的行为，例如在HuggingFace上搜索基准而不是解决任务，或在航班预订任务中滥用信用卡。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估代理的方式并解决代理评估中的常见陷阱，希望将重点从在基准测试中表现出色的代理转移到在现实世界中可靠工作的代理。

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGBench是一个新的基准，用于测试语言模型在解释科学出版物方面的推理能力，特别是在临床遗传学领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试无法很好地转化为实际研究，并且传统方法是手动的且劳动密集型的。

Method: CGBench建立在ClinGen之上，并测试了8个不同的语言模型，以评估它们提取相关实验结果、判断证据强度以及分类和描述实验结果的能力。

Result: 结果表明，虽然模型显示出前景，但在文献解释方面存在很大的差距，尤其是在细粒度指令方面。推理模型擅长细粒度任务，而非推理模型更擅长高级解释。

Conclusion: CGBench揭示了语言模型在精确解释科学出版物方面的优势和劣势，为临床遗传学和更广泛的科学领域的人工智能的未来研究开辟了道路。

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，用于训练大型语言模型 (LLM) 提出一系列问题，以揭示用户偏好并改进推荐系统中的个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了个性化 LLM 响应，必须引出用户偏好，尤其是在用户历史有限的情况下。一种获取更多信息的方法是向用户提出澄清问题。然而，在各个领域生成有效的顺序澄清问题仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 遵循受扩散模型启发的两阶段过程。从用户配置文件开始，前向过程生成澄清问题以获得答案，然后逐步删除这些答案，作为向用户配置文件添加“噪声”的一种方式。逆向过程涉及训练模型通过学习提出有效的澄清问题来“去噪”用户配置文件。

Result: 结果表明，我们的方法显着提高了 LLM 在提出漏斗问题和有效引出用户偏好方面的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了 LLM 在提出漏斗问题和有效引出用户偏好方面的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI系统通常作为孤立的黑盒运作，缺乏预测、解释和因果推理的无缝集成，这限制了它们在高风险工业环境中的可信度和实用性。

Method: CausalTrace执行数据驱动的因果分析，并结合工业本体和知识图谱，包括因果发现、反事实推理和根本原因分析等高级功能。

Result: 在学术火箭组装测试平台中，CausalTrace在本体QA中与领域专家达成了高度一致（ROUGE-1: 0.91），并实现了强大的RCA性能（MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92）。在C3AN评估中，它也获得了4.59/5分。

Conclusion: CausalTrace展示了实时部署的精确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

Result: 通过使用包含合约违规测试用例的prompt，可以显著提高模型遵守合约的能力。PACT揭示了传统基准忽略的关键错误，并提供了严格且可解释的指标来评估LLM生成代码片段在功能和合约遵守方面的健壮性。

Conclusion: PACT框架通过提供全面的测试、系统分析和新指标，能够有效评估和提高LLM生成代码片段在功能正确性和合约遵守方面的能力，从而弥补现有基准的不足。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统计方法缺乏语义信息，泛化能力差，可解释性有限。LLM虽然具有少样本泛化能力，但受限于文本且缺乏地理感知。

Method: 引入地理空间感知层（GAL），从原始野火检测数据开始，自动检索和整合来自外部地理数据库的基础设施、人口、地形和天气信息，并将其组装成简洁的、带有单位注释的感知脚本。

Result: 在多个LLM模型上的真实野火场景中评估了该框架，结果表明，具有地理空间基础的Agent的表现优于基线。

Conclusion: 提出的框架可以推广到其他灾害，如洪水和飓风。

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

Motivation: 现有无需训练的方法在优化LRM推理方面存在局限性，要么依赖于僵化的启发式方法，要么只能进行描述性但无法采取行动的分析。

Method: ThinkPilot使用进化过程生成think-prefixes，这些指令由推理行为的分类驱动，以引导模型实现卓越的性能。

Result: ThinkPilot显著提高了效率推理的准确性-长度权衡，大幅提高了安全性，并增强了指令遵循能力。它还可以与现有的基于训练的方法协同工作。

Conclusion: ThinkPilot通过自动识别和引发这些行为，为将LRM推理与任务需求对齐提供了一个通用的框架。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

*Alessandro Achille,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the computational capabilities of AI reasoning agents and proposes a shift from inductive to transductive learning, emphasizing the importance of time reduction over reconstruction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if AI agents can be universal solvers and how they learn to reason, questioning the role of model and training dataset size.

Method: Reinterpreting AI agents as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems and highlighting the role of time in learning to reason. Introducing transductive learning as an alternative to inductive learning.

Result: Theoretical derivation for the power-law scaling of inference time versus training time, and demonstration that scaling model size can lead to savant-like behavior without genuine intelligence.

Conclusion: The key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly considered.

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

Motivation: 现有基于移动性的人口统计推断研究严重依赖于具有人口统计标签的大规模轨迹数据，导致可解释性有限，并且在不同的数据集和用户群体中的泛化性较差。

Method: HiCoTraj通过创建详细的活动记录和多尺度访问摘要，将轨迹转换为语义丰富的自然语言表示。然后，HiCoTraj使用一种新颖的分层思维链推理来系统地指导LLM完成三个认知阶段：事实特征提取、行为模式分析和具有结构化输出的人口统计推断。

Result: 在真实世界轨迹数据上的实验评估表明，HiCoTraj在零样本场景中跨多个人口统计属性实现了具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: HiCoTraj解决了标记人口统计数据的稀缺性挑战，同时提供了透明的推理链。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在具身决策方面潜力巨大，但缺乏物理环境的经验。

Method: 构建了一个综合性的训练基础设施EmboMatrix，包含任务和场景模拟、具身交互和反馈信号，并采用多智能体数据引擎、分布式异构硬件系统和多层次奖励架构等技术。

Conclusion: 交互式的、基于环境的学习能够有效构建真正智能的具身智能体。

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户对推荐系统的推荐不满意时，通常缺乏改变推荐的细粒度控制。大型语言模型 (LLM) 通过允许用户通过自然语言请求来指导他们的推荐，从而提供了一种解决方案。

Method: 在训练时，我们使用 LLM 来模拟用户是否会根据其语言请求批准项目，并且我们训练嵌入模型来近似这种模拟判断。然后，我们将这些基于用户请求的预测集成到传统推荐系统优化的标准信号加权中。在部署时，我们每个用户请求只需要一次 LLM 嵌入计算，从而可以实时控制推荐。

Result: 在 MovieLens 数据集的实验中，我们的方法始终允许对各种请求进行细粒度控制。在一项针对 19 位 Letterboxd 用户的研究中，我们发现 CTRL-Rec 受到用户的积极评价，并且与传统控件相比，显着增强了用户的控制感和对推荐的满意度。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec 方法可以使用户通过自然语言控制推荐系统，提高了用户满意度。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

Result: BeSTAD能够检测行为模式的转变和偏离，并识别大型移动数据集中表现出这些变化的个体。

Conclusion: BeSTAD通过直接从无标签数据中学习个体行为，推动了异常检测向个性化和可解释的移动分析发展。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

*Rabimba Karanjai,Yang Lu,Ranjith Chodavarapu,Lei Xu,Weidong Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在处理随机性任务（如生成随机数、密码、打乱项目等）方面的能力尚不清楚。本文通过实验探讨了LLM处理随机性任务的能力，发现LLM可以生成一定程度的随机输出，但其性能不稳定，且通常与预期行为有显著偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多应用需要随机性，例如随机决策、游戏、调度、AI 代理和密码学相关任务。然而，LLM 在处理随机性方面的能力仍不清楚。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，考虑了各种可能影响 LLM 在涉及随机性任务中性能的因素，例如访问外部工具、任务类型、模型状态（新与非新）和提示策略。实验涵盖了一系列任务，包括生成随机数、生成随机字符串（如密码）、打乱项目以及使用熵和 NIST 随机性测试套件评估随机性的质量。

Result: LLM 可以生成表现出一定程度随机性的输出，但它们的性能不一致，并且经常与预期行为显着偏差。

Conclusion: LLM 在有效处理涉及随机性的任务方面存在局限性，需要在关键领域进行改进。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为 OneLife 的框架，用于在复杂、随机的环境中学习世界动态，该框架通过概率编程框架内的条件激活程序化规则来建模世界动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要集中在具有大量交互数据、简单机制和人工指导的确定性环境中，而本文旨在解决更真实和具有挑战性的环境，即在复杂、随机的环境中学习，智能体只有一次机会探索敌对环境，并且没有人为指导。

Method: 该方法通过条件激活的程序化规则在概率编程框架内对世界动态进行建模。每个规则通过前提条件-效果结构运行，并在相关世界状态中激活。这创建了一个动态计算图，该图仅通过相关规则路由推理和优化，避免了所有规则都对复杂的分层状态的预测做出贡献时的缩放挑战，并能够在稀疏规则激活的情况下学习随机动态。

Result: OneLife 能够在最少的、无指导的交互中成功学习关键环境动态，在测试的 23 个场景中的 16 个场景中优于强大的基线。

Conclusion: 这项工作为自主构建未知、复杂环境的程序化世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Result: 通过案例研究证明了ToPolyAgent的多功能性，这些案例研究涉及不同溶剂条件、恒温器和模拟长度下的各种聚合物结构。

Conclusion: ToPolyAgent为自主和可扩展的多智能体科学研究生态系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种精确控制LLM输出属性强度的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法无法可靠地实现精确的属性强度控制。

Method: 该方法将精确属性强度控制重新定义为目标达成问题，通过时差学习训练轻量级价值函数来预测最终属性强度得分，并采用基于梯度的干预来精确导航模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够以高精度将文本生成引导至用户指定的属性强度，并在三个下游任务中提高了效率。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了对属性强度的细粒度、连续控制，超越了简单的方向对齐。

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

Motivation: 探索LLM在材料科学中的推理能力，填补该领域的空白。

Method: 构建了一个包含1340个问题的大学水平基准测试，问题涵盖材料科学的各个子学科，并进行了结构化和细粒度的分类，以及三层难度分类。此外，还提供了详细的参考解决方案，并结合了多模态推理。

Result: 即使是性能最高的模型Gemini-2.5-Pro，在大学水平的材料科学问题上的准确率也低于80%。不同的推理策略表现不一。

Conclusion: MatSciBench为评估和推动LLM在材料科学领域的科学推理能力提供了全面的基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B

Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,

we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA

fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the
GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These
results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control

Conclusion: 本文为 XAI 开发者提供了一个以人为本的 XAI 系统属性和评估指标的整体概述，并为 XAI 系统的以人为本设计提出了目标。

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM agent在处理目标导向查询时能力有限，尤其是在需要分解目标为多个相互依赖的API调用时。小型开源模型难以有效执行复杂的工具使用。

Method: GOAT自动构建合成数据集，从给定的API文档中生成目标导向的API执行任务，使模型能够推理相互依赖的调用并生成连贯的响应。

Result: GOAT训练的agent在多个现有目标导向的基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。此外，在新的GOATBench基准测试中也表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT是构建能够进行复杂推理和工具使用的强大开源LLM agent的有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

Method: 该方法引入了三个关键贡献：(1)知识图驱动的患者模拟机制；(2)原位、回合级别的评估框架；(3)一个全面的多轮基准测试。

Result: 对八个最先进的LLM进行了综合多轮基准测试，证明了MedKGEval识别细微行为缺陷和安全风险的能力，而这些缺陷和安全风险常常被传统的评估流程所忽略。

Conclusion: MedKGEval框架最初是为中文和英文医学应用设计的，但可以通过切换输入知识图谱轻松扩展到其他语言，从而确保无缝的双语支持和特定领域的适用性。

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PromptFlow, a modular training framework for automated prompt engineering that uses meta-learning and reinforcement learning to optimize prompts for large language models with minimal task-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic large language models often underperform in specialized domains, and manual prompt design is labor-intensive and requires expertise. Current automated prompt engineering methods lack dynamic strategy selection and fine-grained prompt editing.

Method: The paper proposes PromptFlow, a framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators, optimization, and an evaluator. It uses gradient-based meta-learning and reinforcement learning to explore optimal prompt refinement trajectories.

Result: Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptFlow.

Conclusion: PromptFlow is an effective framework for automated prompt engineering, capable of optimizing prompts for large language models with minimal task-specific data by using meta-learning and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

*Deyu Zou,Yongqiang Chen,Jianxiang Wang,Haochen Yang,Mufei Li,James Cheng,Pan Li,Yu Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based agents often struggle with belief deviation, leading to uninformative actions and failed reinforcement learning training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of belief deviation in LLM-based agents, which hinders effective active reasoning.

Method: Propose a method called T^3 that detects excessive belief deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative tails.

Result: T^3 consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and final performance across 5 challenging tasks, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by roughly 25%.

Conclusion: Belief control is a key principle for developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

Result: 论文展示了如何使用 tensor logic 实现神经、符号和统计人工智能的关键形式，如 transformers、形式推理、核机器和图模型。

Conclusion: tensor logic 使得在嵌入空间中进行可靠推理成为可能，结合了神经网络的可扩展性和可学习性以及符号推理的可靠性和透明性，为人工智能的更广泛应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

*Zirui Guo,Xubin Ren,Lingrui Xu,Jiahao Zhang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG-Anything是一个统一的框架，它能够跨所有模态进行全面的知识检索，通过双图构建和跨模态混合检索实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG框架仅限于文本内容，这在处理多模态文档时存在根本差距。现代知识库本质上是多模态的，包含文本内容、视觉元素、结构化表格和数学表达式的丰富组合。

Method: 该方法将多模态内容重新概念化为相互连接的知识实体，而不是孤立的数据类型。引入双图构建以捕获统一表示中的跨模态关系和文本语义。开发了结合结构知识导航和语义匹配的跨模态混合检索。

Result: RAG-Anything在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试中表现出卓越的性能，与最先进的方法相比实现了显着改进。在传统方法失败的长文档上，性能提升尤为明显。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态知识访问建立了一个新的范例，消除了约束当前系统的架构碎片。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

### [123] [O-Forge: An LLM + Computer Algebra Framework for Asymptotic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12350)
*Ayush Khaitan,Vijay Ganesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在解决奥林匹克数学竞赛题和普特南数学竞赛题方面表现出先进的能力，但它们在研究数学中的作用仍然有限。本文提出了一个名为 LLM+CAS 的框架和一个名为 O-Forge 的相关工具，该工具将前沿 LLM 与计算机代数系统 (CAS) 结合在一个上下文符号反馈循环中，以生成既具有创造性又经过符号验证的证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关键困难在于验证：建议的证明可能看起来合理，但在没有严格检查的情况下不能被信任。许多数学家，包括 Terry Tao，建议使用 AI 工具来找到正确的分解对于研究级别的渐近分析非常有用。

Method: 使用 LLM 建议域分解，并使用 CAS（例如 Mathematica）提供每个片段的公理验证。

Result: 我们的框架 LLM+CAS 在通过前沿 LLM 和 CAS 的组合提出此类分解方面非常有效。我们回答了 Terence Tao 提出的问题：耦合验证器的 LLM 是否可以用来帮助证明复杂的渐近不等式。

Conclusion: 我们展示了 AI 如何超越竞赛数学，朝着专业数学家的研究级工具发展。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对使用大型语言模型进行“Vibe Coding”这一新兴开发方法进行了全面综述，揭示了其潜力和挑战，并提出了实践框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决当前对“Vibe Coding”的有效性研究不足的问题，尤其是在生产力损失和人机协作方面的挑战。

Method: 通过系统分析1000多篇研究论文，对整个“Vibe Coding”生态系统进行调查，并将其形式化为一个约束马尔可夫决策过程。

Result: 揭示了成功的“Vibe Coding”不仅依赖于agent的能力，还依赖于系统化的上下文工程、完善的开发环境和人机协作开发模型。

Conclusion: 本文为“Vibe Coding”建立了理论基础和实践框架，强调了上下文工程、开发环境和人机协作模型的重要性。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为PricingLogic的基准，用于评估大型语言模型(llm)在旅游相关价格自动化方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游机构希望使用人工智能系统自动完成旅游相关价格的计算，但未经验证的llm可能会导致重大经济损失并削弱客户信任。

Method: PricingLogic包含300个自然语言问题，这些问题基于来自42个真实定价策略的预订请求，跨越两个难度级别：(i)基本客户类型定价和(ii)涉及交互折扣的捆绑旅游计算。

Result: 对一系列llm的评估显示，在较难的层面上性能急剧下降，暴露了规则解释和算术推理方面的系统性失败。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，尽管llm具有通用能力，但在没有进一步保障措施或领域适应的情况下，当今的llm在收入关键型应用中仍然不可靠。

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

### [126] [MTOS: A LLM-Driven Multi-topic Opinion Simulation Framework for Exploring Echo Chamber Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12423)
*Dingyi Zuo,Hongjie Zhang,Jie Ou,Chaosheng Feng,Shuwan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个名为 MTOS 的社会模拟框架，它集成了多主题环境与大型语言模型 (LLM)，以解决社交媒体上意见极化、信息隔离和认知偏差等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究主要集中在单一主题上，限制了在多主题、跨领域环境中捕捉认知转移。传统的数值模型简化了复杂的语言态度，缺乏可解释性、行为一致性以及整合多个主题的能力。

Method: 该框架利用 LLM 以及短期和长期记忆，结合了多种用户选择互动机制和动态主题选择策略，并采用信念衰减机制来实现跨主题的视角更新。

Result: 多主题设置显著改变了极化趋势：正相关的topic会加剧回音室效应，负相关的topic会抑制回音室效应，不相关的topic也会通过资源竞争来减轻回音室效应。与数值模型相比，基于 LLM 的agent能够真实地模拟动态的观点变化，重现新闻文本的语言特征，并捕捉复杂的人类推理，从而提高模拟的可解释性和系统稳定性。

Conclusion: MTOS 框架能够有效地模拟社交媒体中多主题环境下的意见演化，并能更真实地反映人类的认知过程。

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

*Chengyang Dong,Nan Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的决策框架，该框架集成了偏置注意力机制，以提高在无信号交叉口自主驾驶的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无信号交叉口进行自主驾驶决策非常具有挑战性，因为存在复杂的动态交互和高冲突风险。为了实现主动安全控制。

Method: 该框架建立在软Actor-Critic（SAC）算法的基础上，其核心创新在于使用偏置注意力来构建交通风险预测器。该预测器评估车辆进入交叉口的长期碰撞风险，并将该风险转化为密集的奖励信号，以指导SAC代理做出安全有效的驾驶决策。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法有效地提高了交叉口的交通效率和车辆安全性。

Conclusion: 证明了智能决策框架在复杂场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is
available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.

*Jiaxin Gao,Chen Chen,Yanwen Jia,Xueluan Gong,Kwok-Yan Lam,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）越来越多地用于自动评估通信系统中的内容质量，但这些 AI “评判者”的公正性无法保证。本文系统地研究了两种 LLM 评判模型（即 GPT-Judge 和 JudgeLM）在逐点评分设置下的判断偏差，涵盖 11 种类型的偏差，包括隐性和显性形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究 LLM 作为评判者时可能存在的偏见，这些偏见会影响评估结果并损害用户信任。

Method: 系统地调查了两种 LLM 评判模型（GPT-Judge 和 JudgeLM）在逐点评分设置下的判断偏差，涵盖 11 种类型的偏差。

Result: LLM 评判者对有偏见的输入表现出鲁棒性，通常会给它们分配比相应的干净样本更低的分数。提供详细的评分标准可以进一步提高这种鲁棒性。在高质量但有偏见的回应上对 LLM 进行微调会显著降低其性能，突出了在有偏见的数据上进行训练的风险。判断的分数与任务难度相关：像 GPQA 这样的具有挑战性的数据集产生较低的平均分数，而像 JudgeLM-val 这样的开放式推理数据集产生较高的平均分数。

Conclusion: 提出了四种潜在的缓解策略，以确保在实际通信场景中进行公平和可靠的 AI 判断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个面向任务的对话框架，用于将医学算法和指南转化为临床问题语料库，并通过层级聚类、扩展剪枝等机制优化问询流程，最终自动生成结构化报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在构建一个能够有效整合医学知识、适应患者反馈并优化医患交互的对话系统，以提升临床工作效率并降低认知负荷。

Method: 该系统采用有向无环图(DAG)结构，集成了医学算法转化流程、基于层级聚类的冷启动机制、扩展剪枝机制以及终止逻辑，并结合人机交互原则设计了患者和医生应用。

Result: 初步评估显示，患者应用在认知负荷、可用性和满意度方面表现出色，医生应用也展现了良好的可用性和满意度，同时两者均能有效融入临床工作流程。

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效降低认知需求并支持高效的报告生成，但仍存在系统延迟和小样本评估等局限性。

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

TL;DR: 人工智能虚拟细胞(AIVCs)旨在从多模态、多尺度测量中学习细胞状态的可执行、决策相关的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究在跨模态对齐、扰动图谱扩展和通路水平读数方面有所进展，但跨实验室和平台的可移植性有限，数据分割易受泄露和覆盖偏差的影响，剂量、时间和组合效应尚未得到系统处理。跨尺度耦合也受到限制。

Method: 我们提出了一个模型无关的细胞状态潜在(CSL)视角，该视角通过算子语法组织学习：测量、用于跨尺度耦合的提升/投影，以及用于剂量和调度的干预。

Result: 该视角推动了一个跨模态、尺度、上下文和干预的决策对齐评估蓝图，并强调功能空间读数，如通路活动、空间邻域和临床相关终点。

Conclusion: 我们建议采用算子感知数据设计、抗泄漏分区以及透明的校准和报告，以实现可重复的、同类比较。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

TL;DR: ProtoSiTex是一个半可解释框架，专为细粒度多标签文本分类而设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的模型提供直观的解释，但通常在粗粒度（句子或文档级别）上运行，并且未能解决现实世界文本分类的多标签性质。

Method: ProtoSiTex采用双阶段交替训练策略：无监督原型发现阶段，学习语义连贯和多样化的原型；以及有监督分类阶段，将这些原型映射到类标签。分层损失函数在子句、句子和文档级别上强制一致性，从而增强可解释性和对齐。

Result: 在酒店评论数据集和两个公共基准（二元和多类）上的实验表明，ProtoSiTex实现了最先进的性能，同时提供了忠实、与人类对齐的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex是半可解释多标签文本分类的强大解决方案。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多智能体强化学习框架，其中每个智能体都被分配了一个基因型，并且奖励函数是根据内含适应度的概念建模的。


<details>

Motivation: 自然选择的竞争和合作力量驱动了数百万年智力的进化，最终形成了自然界巨大的生物多样性和人类思维的复杂性。

Method: 每个智能体都被分配了一个基因型，奖励函数是根据内含适应度的概念建模的。智能体的遗传物质可以与其他智能体共享，并且我们的内含奖励函数自然地解释了这一点。

Result: 在具有囚徒困境的两种类型的网络游戏中研究了由此产生的社会动态，发现我们的结果与生物学中公认的原理（例如汉密尔顿规则）相符。

Conclusion: 在智能体中加入内含适应度为更具战略性和社会智能的智能体的出现奠定了基础。

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个名为 HardcoreLogic 的新基准，用于评估大型推理模型在逻辑游戏中的鲁棒性，特别是当面对非典型的游戏变体时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语料库侧重于像 9x9 数独这样的流行谜题，这可能会导致过度拟合规范格式和记忆解决方案模式。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了 HardcoreLogic。

Method: HardcoreLogic 通过三个维度系统地转换规范谜题：增加的复杂性 (IC)、不常见元素 (UE) 和无法解决的谜题 (UP)，从而减少对快捷方式记忆的依赖。

Result: 对各种 LRM 的评估显示，性能显着下降，表明严重依赖记忆的刻板印象。虽然增加的复杂性是主要的困难来源，但模型也难以应对细微的规则变化，这些变化不一定会增加谜题的难度。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic 暴露了当前 LRM 的局限性，并为推进高级逻辑推理建立了一个基准。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在长程 Agent 任务中面临挑战，因为它们有限的内存很容易被分散或不相关的上下文所淹没。现有的工作记忆方法通常依赖于与 Agent 核心策略分离的外部启发式机制。

Method: 该论文将工作记忆管理重新定义为一种可学习的内在能力，并提出了 Memory-as-Action 框架。此外，还提出了一种新的算法，即动态上下文策略优化 (DCPO)，通过在记忆动作点分割轨迹并将轨迹级优势应用于生成的动作段，从而实现稳定的端到端强化学习。

Result: 结果表明，以端到端的方式联合优化任务推理和记忆管理不仅降低了整体计算消耗，而且提高了任务性能，这得益于根据模型内在能力量身定制的自适应上下文管理策略。

Conclusion: 该论文表明，通过强化学习共同优化任务推理和记忆管理，可以有效地提高任务性能并降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

TL;DR: ERA: A two-stage framework integrating prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL) to improve embodied AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller VLMs lack the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in complex environments, while large-scale models are costly to deploy.

Method: A two-stage framework: 1) Embodied Prior Learning distills knowledge from trajectory-augmented priors, environment-anchored priors, and external knowledge priors. 2) Online RL pipeline builds on these priors with self-summarization, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization.

Result: ERA-3B surpasses prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines, achieving improvements of 8.4% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o.

Conclusion: ERA offers a practical path toward scalable embodied intelligence and provides methodological insights for future embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

*Tianyu Hu,Zhen Tan,Song Wang,Huaizhi Qu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体辩论框架来提高LLM自动判断任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于简单的聚合方法（例如，多数投票），即使单个智能体提供正确的答案也可能失败。

Method: 通过数学方式对辩论过程进行形式化，分析智能体交互，并证明辩论可以提高正确性。引入稳定性检测机制，通过时变 Beta-Binomial 混合模型对判断共识动态进行建模，并基于分布相似性（Kolmogorov-Smirnov 检验）进行自适应停止。

Result: 在多个基准和模型上的实验表明，该框架提高了判断准确性，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 该框架优于多数投票，提高了LLM自动判断任务的准确性

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用车载通信（CAMs）进行车辆轨迹预测的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车辆配备昂贵的传感器以减少事故风险，但传感器视野受限。车载通信可以解决这个问题，通过共享信息使车辆即使在传感器被遮挡时也能感知彼此。

Method: 设计并训练了一个基于车载通信消息的图神经网络（CAMNet），并在一个广泛使用的运动预测数据集上进行了训练。在第二个数据集上评估了该模型，以评估此类数据是否可以有效利用。

Result: 结果表明，车载通信确实可以支持车辆轨迹预测。

Conclusion: 车载通信在车辆轨迹预测中具有潜力，但也存在一些局限性，为未来的研究提供了机会。

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

Result: 与现有的最先进方法相比，该方法的受试者工作特征曲线下面积 (AUROC) = 0.99。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了 AI 系统的鲁棒性，且无需标记数据。

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =
0.99.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的JavaScript模糊测试方法，称为CLUTCH，它使用深度组合bandit来选择更好的突变目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的JavaScript模糊测试方法使用随机选择来确定在JavaScript代码中执行突变的位置，效率较低。

Method: CLUTCH是一种深度组合bandit，它可以观察可变长度的JavaScript测试用例表示，并使用深度学习中的注意力机制。此外，使用Concrete Dropout，CLUTCH可以动态地调整其探索。

Result: CLUTCH在JavaScript模糊测试中的效率比三种最先进的解决方案分别提高了20.3%和8.9%。在挥发性和组合设置中，CLUTCH的遗憾值分别减少了至少78.1%和4.1%。

Conclusion: CLUTCH是一种有效的JavaScript模糊测试方法，它可以提高测试用例的有效性和覆盖率。

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

Method: Ax-Prover通过模型上下文协议（MCP）为大型语言模型（LLM）配备Lean工具，以确保形式上的正确性。

Result: 在公共数据集上，Ax-Prover与最先进的provers竞争，并且在新的基准测试中大大优于它们。它能够形式化复杂密码学定理的证明。

Conclusion: Ax-Prover提供了一种通用的形式验证方法，可以在不同的科学领域中使用。

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of fragmentation, limited adaptability, suboptimal performance, and poor extensibility in existing systems for AI-powered data analysis.

Method: Aixel organizes work across four layers: application, task, model, and data. The task layer provides a declarative interface, an optimizer compiles and schedules a plan, and the task layer coordinates the execution of data and model operators. The model layer offers versioned storage and supports adaptive construction, task-aligned drift detection, and safe updates. The data layer provides unified data management capabilities.

Result: Aixel delivers a user friendly, adaptive, efficient, and extensible system.

Conclusion: Aixel is a unified, adaptive, and extensible system for AI-powered data analysis.

Abstract: A growing trend in modern data analysis is the integration of data management
with learning, guided by accuracy, latency, and cost requirements. In practice,
applications draw data of different formats from many sources. In the
meanwhile, the objectives and budgets change over time. Existing systems handle
these applications across databases, analysis libraries, and tuning services.
Such fragmentation leads to complex user interaction, limited adaptability,
suboptimal performance, and poor extensibility across components. To address
these challenges, we present Aixel, a unified, adaptive, and extensible system
for AI-powered data analysis. The system organizes work across four layers:
application, task, model, and data. The task layer provides a declarative
interface to capture user intent, which is parsed into an executable operator
plan. An optimizer compiles and schedules this plan to meet specified goals in
accuracy, latency, and cost. The task layer coordinates the execution of data
and model operators, with built-in support for reuse and caching to improve
efficiency. The model layer offers versioned storage for index, metadata,
tensors, and model artifacts. It supports adaptive construction, task-aligned
drift detection, and safe updates that reuse shared components. The data layer
provides unified data management capabilities, including indexing,
constraint-aware discovery, task-aligned selection, and comprehensive feature
management. With the above designed layers, Aixel delivers a user friendly,
adaptive, efficient, and extensible system.

TL;DR: 提出了一种框架，将强大的vLLM的偏好排序提炼成基于嵌入的系统，从而实现个性化的文本图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于嵌入的方法主要在字面描述性文本图像对上训练，通常无法捕捉产品推荐应用中常见的抽象或人物角色驱动的属性。而先进的视觉语言模型(vLLM)虽然可以灵活地将文本与图像对齐，但其有限的上下文窗口使其无法直接处理大型目录的检索。

Method: 将强大的vLLM的偏好排序提炼成基于嵌入的系统。

Result: 在人物角色驱动的产品推荐任务上的实验表明，该方法明显优于现有的基于嵌入的基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化的文本图像检索提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Text--image retrieval is necessary for applications such as product
recommendation. Embedding-based approaches like CLIP enable efficient
large-scale retrieval via vector similarity search, but they are primarily
trained on literal caption-like text--image pairs and often fail to capture
abstract or persona-driven attributes common in product recommendation
applications (e.g., ``a gift for a mother who loves gardening''). In contrast,
state-of-the-art vision--language models (vLLMs) can align text with images in
a flexible manner, but their limited context window prevents them from directly
handling retrieval over large catalogs. We propose a framework that distills
the preference rankings of a powerful vLLM into an embedding-based system,
transferring its nuanced alignment abilities while maintaining the
inference-time scalability of an embedding-based approach. Experiments on
persona-driven product recommendation tasks demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing embedding-based baselines, providing an
efficient solution for personalized text--image retrieval.

Motivation: 现有基于图的论文推荐方法忽略了学术网络中普遍存在的不对称学术影响。

Method: 该模型采用基于重力的方法来衡量学者之间的相互学术影响，并将其纳入图表示学习的消息传递过程中。此外，该模型利用多通道聚合方法来捕获不同单关系子网络的个体嵌入及其相互依赖的嵌入。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上进行的大量实验表明，MIARec 模型在三个主要评估指标上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MIARec 模型在科学论文推荐任务中表现出有效性。

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of scientific literature, scholars increasingly
demand precise and high-quality paper recommendations. Among various
recommendation methodologies, graph-based approaches have garnered attention by
effectively exploiting the structural characteristics inherent in scholarly
networks. However, these methods often overlook the asymmetric academic
influence that is prevalent in scholarly networks when learning graph
representations. To address this limitation, this study proposes the
Mutual-Influence-Aware Recommendation (MIARec) model, which employs a
gravity-based approach to measure the mutual academic influence between
scholars and incorporates this influence into the feature aggregation process
during message propagation in graph representation learning. Additionally, the
model utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual
embeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent
embeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the
heterogeneous scholarly network. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world
datasets demonstrate that the MIARec model outperforms baseline models across
three primary evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in scientific
paper recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: ReRe不仅提高了基础模型和SFT初始化模型的性能，而且在不同的backbone families和scales上具有鲁棒的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally
shifted recommender systems from discriminative to generative paradigms, where
user behavior modeling is achieved by generating target items conditioned on
historical interactions. Yet current generative recommenders still suffer from
two core limitations: the lack of high-quality negative modeling and the
reliance on implicit rewards. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) offers a natural solution by enabling on-policy sampling of harder
negatives and grounding optimization in explicit reward signals. However,
applying RLVR to generative recommenders remains non-trivial. Its unique
generation space often leads to invalid or repetitive items that undermine
sampling efficiency, and ranking supervision is sparse since most items receive
identical zero rewards. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforced
Preference Optimization for Recommendation (ReRe), a reinforcement-based
paradigm tailored to LLM-based recommenders, an important direction in
generative recommendation. ReRe incorporates constrained beam search to improve
sampling efficiency and diversify hard negatives, while augmenting rule-based
accuracy rewards with auxiliary ranking rewards for finer-grained supervision.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that ReRe
consistently outperforms both traditional and LLM-based recommenders in ranking
performance. Further analysis shows that ReRe not only enhances performance
across both base and SFT-initialized models but also generalizes robustly
across different backbone families and scales. Beyond empirical gains, we
systematically investigate the design space of RLVR in recommendation across
generation, sampling strategy, reward modeling, and optimization algorithm,
offering insights for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have recently achieved remarkable progress
in video question answering (VideoQA) by jointly processing visual, textual,

are most effective for MLLMs, and how different modalities balance task
accuracy against computational efficiency. In this work, we present a
comprehensive empirical study of video representation methods for VideoQA with
MLLMs. We systematically evaluate single modality inputs question only,
subtitles, visual frames, and audio signals as well as multimodal combinations,
on two widely used benchmarks: VideoMME and LongVideoBench. Our results show
that visual frames substantially enhance accuracy but impose heavy costs in GPU
memory and inference latency, while subtitles provide a lightweight yet
effective alternative, particularly for long videos. These findings highlight
clear trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency and provide practical
insights for designing resource-aware MLLM-based VideoQA systems.

Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems enhance personalized recommendations in
e-commerce and online advertising by integrating visual, textual, and user-item
interaction data. However, existing methods often overlook two critical biases:
(i) modal confounding, where latent factors (e.g., brand style or product
category) simultaneously drive multiple modalities and influence user
preference, leading to spurious feature-preference associations; (ii)
interaction bias, where genuine user preferences are mixed with noise from
exposure effects and accidental clicks. To address these challenges, we propose
a Causal-inspired multimodal Recommendation framework. Specifically, we
introduce a dual-channel cross-modal diffusion module to identify hidden modal
confounders, utilize back-door adjustment with hierarchical matching and
vector-quantized codebooks to block confounding paths, and apply front-door
adjustment combined with causal topology reconstruction to build a deconfounded
causal subgraph. Extensive experiments on three real-world e-commerce datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines while maintaining strong interpretability.

Motivation: ColBERT等方法使用单层线性投影降维，但其内在局限性有待研究。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验评估，设计并评估了多种替代投影模块，例如更深层的非线性FFN块、GLU块和跳跃连接。

Result: 许多改进的投影变体优于原始线性投影，最佳变体在多个检索基准测试中平均提高了超过2个NDCG@10点。放大的中间投影和残差连接尤为重要。

Conclusion: 用更复杂的投影层替换ColBERT模型的线性层是一种稳健的、即插即用的升级方案。

Abstract: Multi-vector dense retrieval methods like ColBERT systematically use a
single-layer linear projection to reduce the dimensionality of individual
vectors. In this study, we explore the implications of the MaxSim operator on
the gradient flows of the training of multi-vector models and show that such a
simple linear projection has inherent, if non-critical, limitations in this
setting. We then discuss the theoretical improvements that could result from
replacing this single-layer projection with well-studied alternative
feedforward linear networks (FFN), such as deeper, non-linear FFN blocks, GLU
blocks, and skip-connections, could alleviate these limitations. Through the
design and systematic evaluation of alternate projection blocks, we show that
better-designed final projections positively impact the downstream performance
of ColBERT models. We highlight that many projection variants outperform the
original linear projections, with the best-performing variants increasing
average performance on a range of retrieval benchmarks across domains by over 2
NDCG@10 points. We then conduct further exploration on the individual
parameters of these projections block in order to understand what drives this
empirical performance, highlighting the particular importance of upscaled
intermediate projections and residual connections. As part of these ablation
studies, we show that numerous suboptimal projection variants still outperform
the traditional single-layer projection across multiple benchmarks, confirming
our hypothesis. Finally, we observe that this effect is consistent across
random seeds, further confirming that replacing the linear layer of ColBERT
models is a robust, drop-in upgrade.

compact sequences for large-scale modeling. Extending this paradigm to graphs
requires a tokenization scheme that handles non-Euclidean structures and
multi-scale dependencies efficiently. Existing approaches to graph
tokenization, linearized, continuous, and quantized, remain limited in
adaptability and efficiency. In particular, most current quantization-based
tokenizers organize hierarchical information in fixed or task-agnostic ways,
which may either over-represent or under-utilize structural cues, and lack the
ability to dynamically reweight contributions from different levels without
retraining the encoder. This work presents a hierarchical quantization
framework that introduces a self-weighted mechanism for task-adaptive
aggregation across multiple scales. The proposed method maintains a frozen
encoder while modulating information flow through a lightweight gating process,
enabling parameter-efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks.
Experiments on benchmark datasets for node classification and link prediction
demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines under comparable
computational budgets.

### [149] [Leveraging Language Semantics for Collaborative Filtering with TextGCN and TextGCN-MLP: Zero-Shot vs In-Domain Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12461)
*Andrei Chernov,Haroon Wahab,Oleg Novitskij*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TextGCN的推荐系统框架，该框架利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成的项目标题嵌入，并通过图卷积层进行处理，以实现zero-shot推荐。此外，还提出了TextGCN-MLP，通过对比学习训练多层感知器，以提高在特定领域内的推荐性能。然而，TextGCN-MLP的zero-shot性能不如TextGCN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）将文本信息融入推荐系统，现有方法主要集中在微调LLM生成推荐或将基于LLM的嵌入集成到下游模型中。

Method: 提出TextGCN，直接对基于LLM的项目标题嵌入应用无参数图卷积层，而不是像传统方法那样学习基于ID的嵌入。此外，还引入了TextGCN-MLP，使用对比损失训练可训练的多层感知器。

Result: TextGCN实现了state-of-the-art的zero-shot性能，显著优于以前的方法。TextGCN-MLP在推荐基准测试中实现了state-of-the-art的in-domain性能。然而，TextGCN-MLP的zero-shot性能低于TextGCN。

Conclusion: 结合语言语义和图消息传递可以有效提升推荐系统的性能。在领域内专业化和zero-shot泛化之间存在权衡。

Abstract: In recent years, various approaches have been proposed to leverage large
language models (LLMs) for incorporating textual information about items into
recommender systems. Existing methods primarily focus on either fine-tuning
LLMs to generate recommendations or integrating LLM-based embeddings into
downstream models. In this work, we follow the latter direction and propose
\textbf{TextGCN}, which applies parameter-free graph convolution layers
directly over LLM-based item-title embeddings, instead of learning ID-based
embeddings as in traditional methods. By combining language semantics with
graph message passing, this architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, significantly outperforming prior approaches. Furthermore, we
introduce \textbf{TextGCN-MLP}, which extends TextGCN with a trainable
multilayer perceptron trained using a contrastive loss, achieving
state-of-the-art in-domain performance on recommendation benchmarks. However,
the zero-shot performance of TextGCN-MLP remains lower than that of TextGCN,
highlighting the trade-off between in-domain specialization and zero-shot
generalization. We release our code on github at

TL;DR: SMILE: 通过融合对齐语义ID来增强项目表示，解决冷启动问题，提高项目CTR、买家数量和订单量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法解决协作和内容之间的不对称性以及项目之间的细微差异。

Method: 使用RQ-OPQ编码量化项目内容和协作信息，然后进行两步对齐：RQ编码转移共享协作信号，OPQ编码学习项目的差异化信息。

Result: 离线实验和在线A/B测试表明，SMILE 具有优越性，项目点击率 +1.66%，买家 +1.57%，订单量 +2.17%。

Conclusion: SMILE有效地提升了冷启动项目的性能。

Abstract: With the rise of modern search and recommendation platforms, insufficient
collaborative information of cold-start items exacerbates the Matthew effect of
existing platform items, challenging platform diversity and becoming a
longstanding issue. Existing methods align items' side content with
collaborative information to transfer collaborative signals from
high-popularity items to cold-start items. However, these methods fail to
account for the asymmetry between collaboration and content, nor the
fine-grained differences among items. To address these issues, we propose
SMILE, an item representation enhancement approach based on fused alignment of
semantic IDs. Specifically, we use RQ-OPQ encoding to quantize item content and
collaborative information, followed by a two-step alignment: RQ encoding
transfers shared collaborative signals across items, while OPQ encoding learns
differentiated information of items. Comprehensive offline experiments on
large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate superiority of SMILE, and rigorous
online A/B tests confirm statistically significant improvements: item CTR
+1.66%, buyers +1.57%, and order volume +2.17%.

*Minghao Tang,Shiyu Ni,Jingtong Wu,Zengxin Han,Keping Bi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 参数检索增强生成 (PRAG) 将文档编码为模型参数，并在推理期间将这些表示注入模型中，从而实现 LLM 和文档之间在参数级别的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管参数检索增强生成 (PRAG) 受到了越来越多的关注，但人们对其参数注入的机制仍然知之甚少。本文旨在系统地研究 PRAG，以阐明参数注入的作用。

Method: 通过系统的研究来揭示PRAG的机理

Result: 参数化的文档仅捕获了文档的部分语义信息，并且仅依赖于它们会产生比文本级别交互差的性能。但是，这些参数化表示形式编码了高层次的文档信息，可以增强模型对输入上下文中文档的理解。当把参数化的文档和文本化的文档结合起来，模型可以更有效地利用相关信息，并且对噪声输入更加鲁棒，从而获得比单独使用任何一种来源更好的性能。

Conclusion: 我们建议共同使用参数化和文本化文档，并提倡增加参数化表示形式的信息含量，以推进 PRAG。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving external documents. As an emerging form of RAG, parametric
retrieval-augmented generation (PRAG) encodes documents as model parameters
(i.e., LoRA modules) and injects these representations into the model during
inference, enabling interaction between the LLM and documents at parametric
level. Compared with directly placing documents in the input context, PRAG is
more efficient and has the potential to offer deeper model-document
interaction. Despite its growing attention, the mechanism underlying parametric
injection remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic
study of PRAG to clarify the role of parametric injection, showing that
parameterized documents capture only partial semantic information of documents,
and relying on them alone yields inferior performance compared to interaction
at text level. However, these parametric representations encode high-level
document information that can enhance the model's understanding of documents
within the input context. When combined parameterized documents with textual
documents, the model can leverage relevant information more effectively and
become more robust to noisy inputs, achieving better performance than either
source alone. We recommend jointly using parameterized and textual documents
and advocate for increasing the information content of parametric
representations to advance PRAG.

TL;DR: SAIL-Embedding是一个全模态嵌入基础模型，通过定制的训练策略和架构设计，解决了现有模型在实际应用和商业场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态嵌入模型在模态支持、训练机制和工业领域存在局限性。

Method: 提出了一个多阶段训练方案，包括内容感知的渐进式训练、协作感知的推荐增强训练、随机专业化和数据集驱动的模式匹配。

Result: 在不同的检索任务中取得了SOTA性能，并在各种实际场景中观察到Lifetime（LT）的显著增加。

Conclusion: SAIL-Embedding模型在推荐体验的关键指标上取得了显著提升，例如在抖音精选场景中7天LT提升了+0.158%，14天LT提升了+0.144%，在抖音feed排序模型中，SAIL-Embedding产生的匹配特征带来了+0.08%的AUC增益。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations
that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the
evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language
models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world
applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support,
unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we
introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that
addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural
design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme
to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning.
Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the
model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched
cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement
training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios
by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while
mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic
specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training
flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding
achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval
tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated
with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a
crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model
delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.158% and the 14-day LT gain of +0.144% in the
Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features
produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.08% AUC gain.

*Qingwen Li,Xiaohang Zhao,Xiao Han,Hailiang Huang,Lanjuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor: A novel ICU mortality prediction framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU mortality prediction needs interpretability, aligning with clinical course, demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness, but current methods fall short.

Method: Proposes ProtoDoctor with Prognostic Clinical Course Identification and Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition modules.

Result: ProtoDoctor outperforms baselines in accuracy and provides more meaningful interpretations.

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor effectively integrates key ICU decision-making elements, enhancing interpretability and trustworthiness in mortality prediction.

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的强化学习训练框架GAR，用于联合训练问题生成器和解算器，以提高定理证明的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖于固定的问题集，导致训练效率低下，并限制了模型解决复杂问题的能力。

Method: GAR通过对抗循环联合训练问题生成器和解算器，引入隐式课程学习机制，使任务难度与证明者的能力相匹配。

Result: 在MiniF2F-Test基准测试中，Goedel-Prover-V2-8B和DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B的pass@32平均相对提高了4.20%，DeepSeek-Prover-V2在ProofNet-Test上的pass@32从22.58%提高到25.81%。

Conclusion: GAR为在可验证环境中问题生成和解决的协同进化建立了一个通用的强化学习范例。

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多样化的结构模式和特征分布，节点级异常检测 (NAD) 具有挑战性。因此，NAD 是一项关键任务，具有多种应用，范围从欺诈检测、网络安全到推荐系统。

Method: 每个节点都由两个视图描述，这两个视图由原始特征和从随机游走和度数导出的结构特征组成，然后嵌入到欧几里得和双曲空间中。配备有对比学习目标作为正则化项的multi Graph-Autoencoder框架，对齐欧几里得和双曲空间中的嵌入，突出显示难以协调且因此可能异常的节点。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，Janus 始终优于浅层和深层基线，经验表明，结合多个几何表示提供了一种稳健有效的方法来识别图中细微而复杂的异常。

Conclusion: 结合多个几何表示提供了一种稳健有效的方法来识别图中细微而复杂的异常。

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了生成人工智能中的Schrödinger桥问题，并提出了一种软约束Schrödinger桥问题(SCSBP)来解决经典SBP在实际应用中的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典Schrödinger桥问题(SBP)强制执行硬终端约束，这在实际应用中常常导致不稳定性，尤其是在高维或数据稀缺的情况下。

Method: 本文 অনুসরণ了软约束Schrödinger桥问题(SCSBP)的思想，其中终端约束被替换为一个一般的惩罚函数。这种松弛导致了McKean-Vlasov类型的一种更灵活的随机控制公式。

Result: 本文建立了所有惩罚水平下最优解的存在性，并证明了随着惩罚的增加，控制和价值函数都以线性速率收敛到经典SBP的控制和价值函数。

Conclusion: 这些结果不仅为软约束桥提供了第一个定量收敛保证，而且阐明了惩罚正则化如何实现鲁棒的生成建模、微调和迁移学习。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解单个训练样本如何影响模型的预测行为对于分析和改进现代机器学习系统至关重要。估计这种影响可以实现数据选择和模型调试等关键应用。现有的数据影响测量方法要么精度低，要么计算成本高，无法应用于大型模型。

Method: 提出了一种高效的零阶近似方法，只需要训练和测试数据上中间检查点的损失值以及检查点本身。

Result: 该方法在估计自影响方面实现了更高的精度，在估计训练-测试影响方面实现了相当或更高的精度，从而能够对训练数据如何塑造模型行为进行可扩展和实际的分析。

Conclusion: 该方法计算效率高，精度高，适用于分析训练数据对模型行为的影响。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成模型通常与安全分类器配合使用，以过滤有害或不良的输出。一种常见的策略是微调生成器以降低被过滤的概率，但这往往会导致模型产生接近分类器决策边界的样本，从而增加假阳性和假阴性。

Method: 提出 Boundary Guidance，一种强化学习微调方法，可明确引导生成远离分类器的边界。

Result: 在越狱和模棱两可的提示的基准测试中，Boundary Guidance 提高了输出的安全性和效用，这由 LLM-as-a-Judge 评估判断。

Conclusion: 全面的模型规模和奖励设计的消融实验证明了我们方法的稳健性。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 WaveletDiff 的新框架，该框架直接在小波系数上训练扩散模型，以利用时间序列数据的固有 多尺度结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界中的大型高质量时间序列数据集仍然稀缺，当前的合成模型难以重现真实世界时间序列固有的多尺度结构。

Method: 该模型结合了用于每个分解级别的专用 transformers 以及交叉级别注意力机制，这些机制通过自适应门控实现时间尺度和频率尺度之间的选择性信息交换。它还结合了基于 Parseval 定理的各个级别的能量保持约束，以在整个扩散过程中保持频谱保真度。

Result: 在来自能源、金融和神经科学领域的六个真实世界数据集上进行的综合测试表明，WaveletDiff 在五个不同的性能指标上始终优于最先进的时域和频域生成方法，无论是在短时间序列还是长时间序列上。例如，在所有数据集中，WaveletDiff 实现的判别分数和 Context-FID 分数平均比第二好的基线小 3 倍。

Conclusion: WaveletDiff 是一种用于生成高质量时间序列数据的新方法，它优于现有的最先进的方法。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Method: 使用合成数据生成技术，并系统地评估不同的token预算和回放比例配置，以bAbI推理任务为目标。

Result: 揭示了一个平衡特定任务性能和通用知识保留的最佳配置。

Conclusion: 为从业者提供了基于计算预算选择回放比例的经验指导，从而以显着降低的训练成本实现强大的任务适应性。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Result: 当前的模型在二元讽刺检测方面取得了一定的成功，但如果没有针对特定任务的微调，它们仍然无法生成高质量的解释。

Conclusion: 虽然当前的模型在检测讽刺方面取得了一定的成功，但它们仍然无法生成高质量的解释，需要针对特定任务进行微调。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，对actor行为随时间的建模，并将这些信息纳入预测模型，可以提高性能指标的预测能力。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将显式声明的否定语句集成到知识嵌入学习过程中的新方法，该方法使用双模型架构并行训练正例和负例，并通过相互生成负样本来提高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入方法大多依赖于封闭世界假设或局部封闭世界假设，忽略了开放世界假设和显式声明的否定语句。

Method: 采用双模型架构，并行训练正例和负例，并通过相互生成负样本来选择最可能的候选样本。

Result: 在通用和领域特定知识图谱上进行了评估，结果表明该方法提高了链接预测和三元组分类任务的预测性能。

Conclusion: 将有意义的负知识集成到嵌入学习中是有价值的。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART)，这是一个旨在增强DT在对抗随机博弈中鲁棒性的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习方法基于序列建模的对抗鲁棒性在很大程度上仍未被探索。

Method: 通过将Transformer策略建立在源自这些阶段博弈的NashQ值之上，从而生成策略。

Result: CART实现了更准确的minimax值估计，并在各种对抗随机博弈中始终获得卓越的最坏情况回报。

Conclusion: CART生成的策略不易被利用，并且对过渡不确定性具有保守性。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的鲁棒强化学习框架AdaRL，通过自适应调整策略的秩来实现策略复杂性与任务内在维度对齐，在保证鲁棒性的同时避免过度参数化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒强化学习方法依赖嵌套的最小-最大优化，计算成本高且产生过于保守的策略，为了解决环境动态中的认知不确定性问题。

Method: AdaRL是一个双层优化框架，在下层，AdaRL在固定秩约束下执行策略优化，其动力学是从以质心模型为中心的Wasserstein球中采样的；在上层，它自适应地调整秩以平衡偏差-方差的权衡，将策略参数投影到低秩流形上。

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制基准测试中，AdaRL始终优于固定秩基线（例如，SAC）和最先进的鲁棒RL方法（例如，RNAC，Parseval），并且收敛于底层任务的内在秩。

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为模型不确定性下的鲁棒RL提供了一种有效且有原则的替代方案

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

Motivation: 现有方法通常单独建模个人事件和关系事件，忽略了它们之间的联系。为了弥补这一差距，论文提出了一个统一的建模方法。

Method: 论文提出了一个统一的形式化方法，并构建了包含个人和关系事件的数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，同时考虑这两种事件的模型效果更好，但仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 论文发布了数据集，并鼓励未来研究在统一用户事件建模方面取得进展。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

TL;DR: Locaris是一个用于室内定位的decoder-only大型语言模型 (LLM)，无需预处理即可直接摄取原始 Wi-Fi 遥测数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的指纹识别和基于模型的方法通常需要大量的人工校准，并且当设备、信道或部署条件发生变化时，性能会迅速下降。本文旨在解决室内 Wi-Fi 定位中对环境动态、信道传播特性和硬件异构性的高敏感性问题。

Method: 通过在不同的 Wi-Fi 数据集上微调 LLM，Locaris 学习了从原始信号到设备位置的轻量级且可推广的映射。

Result: 实验结果表明，Locaris 在各种类型的遥测数据中，匹配或超过了现有技术。即使在每个设备仅使用少量校准点的情况下，Locaris 也能保持高精度，当应用于以前未见过的设备和部署场景时，也能实现亚米级精度。

Conclusion: 紧凑型 LLM 可以作为室内定位的免校准回归模型，在异构 Wi-Fi 部署中提供可扩展且强大的跨环境性能。Locaris 在实际场景中具有实际可行性，尤其是在大规模部署中，在这些部署中，广泛的校准是不可行的。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mao et al. (2022) 的 RestartQ-UCB 算法的重启设计存在两个核心问题：(1) 完全遗忘，即在重启后丢失所有关于环境的信息；(2) 计划重启，即重启仅发生在预定义的时间，而不管策略与当前环境动态的兼容性。

Method: 我们引入了三种方法，分别称为部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，以修改算法 RestartQ-UCB 和 RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025)。

Result: 我们在多个不同的环境中发现了接近最优的经验性能，相对于 RestartQ-UCB，动态遗憾减少了高达 91%。

Conclusion: 本文研究了非平稳强化学习中的重启策略，并提出了三种改进的重启方法，实验结果表明这些方法可以显著提高性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

Method: 本文提出了一种基于最大平均差异(MMD)的可编程先验框架，允许用户显式地塑造潜在空间。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种用于表示工程的基础工具，为模型的可识别性和因果推理开辟了新的途径。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Motivation: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport, overlooking shared structure.

Method: Formulation is based on novel velocity-powered transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one).

Result: Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with fewer integration steps on synthetic, image, and biology datasets.

Conclusion: Y-shaped generative flows introduce a new approach to generative modeling that encourages shared structure and improves performance.

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and

distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with

Motivation: 扩散模型以其生成能力而闻名，但它们的预训练过程表现出明显的学习速度阶段，而之前的后训练加速工作完全忽略了这一点。

Method: 我们的方法利用了扩散预训练的中间快速学习阶段需要更保守的剪枝来保留关键模型特征，而早期和后期的慢速学习阶段则受益于更积极的剪枝策略的观察结果。

Result: 在 DiT 和 SDXL 上的大量实验表明，我们的方法在不影响输出质量的情况下实现了显着的采样加速，并且大大优于以前的最先进方法，同时也为更高效和稳健的免训练扩散加速提供了一个新的视角。

Conclusion: 自适应剪枝机制首次明确地反映了扩散预训练固有的学习速度变化，从而协调了模型的内部训练动态与其加速采样过程。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Conclusion: 这项工作为跨领域见解奠定了基础，以促进对Transformer的更广泛理解。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为冷却加权DPO（CW-DPO）的两阶段方法，用于解决视觉-语言模型（VLM）偏好微调中的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于偏好的VLM微调不稳定，错误的负样本会注入无益的梯度，破坏训练。

Method: 1. 使用gentle negatives进行监督微调，以平滑的低权重监督来规范基础策略，抑制过度自信。2. 应用DPO目标，其中负项通过冷却权重进行缩放，冷却权重根据模型在每个负样本上的平均token log-probability计算得出，从而抑制来自简单或分布外样本的无益梯度，同时保留来自困难负样本的信号。

Result: CW-DPO在各种VLM任务中产生更稳定的优化、更好的校准和更高的成对胜率，同时在更少的步骤中收敛。消融实验表明，冷却权重机制是这些收益的主要驱动因素，并且混合on-policy和数据集负样本具有互补优势。

Conclusion: 在冷却偏好之前平滑学习动态是鲁棒VLM对齐的一个简单通用原则。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

TL;DR: 二阶优化器在训练神经网络方面表现出潜力，但使用精确 Hessian 矩阵时会失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究表明，在计算优化步骤中包含曲率信息具有优势。以往研究主要集中于拟牛顿法，即 Hessian 矩阵的近似方法。本文探讨使用精确 Hessian 矩阵代替近似 Hessian 矩阵的效果。

Method: 通过实验观察神经网络训练过程中使用精确曲率信息时的失效模式。

Result: 神经网络训练在使用精确曲率信息时会可靠地失败。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了非线性离散化的几何特性以及损失 landscape 中驻点的分布，从而对损失 landscape 充满了局部最小值这一传统观点提出了质疑。

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

TL;DR: 本文对Mamba的上下文学习(ICL)能力进行了理论分析，重点研究了由低维非线性目标函数定义的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对Mamba的底层机制的严格理论理解仍然有限。Mamba以其计算效率和强大的经验性能而备受关注。

Method: 我们研究了单指标模型的上下文学习，该模型仅依赖于单个相关方向。

Result: Mamba可以通过测试时特征学习实现有效的ICL，直接从上下文示例中提取相关方向。Mamba的测试时样本复杂度优于线性Transformer，与非线性Transformer相当。

Conclusion: 非线性门控机制在Mamba的特征提取中起着关键作用，强调它是Mamba实现计算效率和高性能的根本驱动力。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的生成分类器，它具有计算效率高、可解释性强等优点，为生成分类器的研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Motivation: 现有的对比学习方法不足以提取充分的领域不变表示，因为它们没有明确解决嵌入在样本中未共享信息中的领域特征。

Method: 提出了一种新的 MEASURE 框架，该框架通过减少领域相关信息，同时保留重要的时域和频谱特征，来实现领域泛化。

Result: 在公开的睡眠分期基准数据集 SleepEDF-20 和 MASS 上的大量实验表明，本文提出的方法始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的 MEASURE 框架能够有效地减少领域相关信息，同时保留用于睡眠分期分类的必要时域和频谱特征，从而提高模型在未见过的受试者身上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our
code is available at : https://github.com/ku-milab/Measure

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的训练数据归因（TDA）方法将一个样本对另一个样本的影响视为静态的，但神经网络的学习过程具有不同的阶段，这些阶段表现出不断变化的影响模式。

Method: 通过在玩具模型中进行分析和实证验证，展示了影响力的动态变化直接映射到模型对语义层次结构的渐进学习。在语言模型中，token级别的影响变化与已知的发展阶段相一致。

Result: 验证了在玩具模型和语言模型中，影响力的动态变化与模型的学习阶段相关。

Conclusion: 论文引入的阶段性数据归因框架能够更好地理解神经网络的学习过程，并为数据归因提供更精确的分析。

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图基础模型假设所有图结构都可以编码在单一欧几里得空间中，这导致在结构边界上性能显著下降。

Method: 提出GraphShaper，一个几何感知框架，通过多几何专业化来增强图编码。该方法采用针对不同几何空间的专家网络，动态计算融合权重，以自适应地整合基于局部结构特征的几何属性。

Result: GraphShaper在引文网络上实现了9.47%的准确率提升，在社交网络上实现了7.63%的准确率提升（zero-shot setting）。

Conclusion: GraphShaper通过尊重图结构的内在几何多样性，有效地提升了图编码性能。

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: 现有方法在细粒度模式识别方面存在困难，特别是在异质图上。通过分析，发现了一个过度抽象问题：当前方法在过大的双曲半径上运行，将多尺度结构信息压缩成统一的高级抽象。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了 H4G，它使用可学习的分块对角缩放矩阵和 M"obius 矩阵乘法来系统地减少嵌入半径。实验表明，H4G 在异质图上实现了 12.8% 的改进，在同质图上实现了 8.4% 的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以进行细粒度模式识别，尤其是在异质图上，因为它们在过大的双曲半径上运行，将多尺度结构信息压缩成统一的抽象，导致信息丢失。

Method: 提出了 H4G 框架，该框架使用可学习的分块对角缩放矩阵和 M"obius 矩阵乘法来系统地减少嵌入半径，从而恢复对细粒度模式的访问，同时保持全局感受能力。

Result: H4G 在异质图上实现了 12.8% 的 zero-shot 性能提升，在同质图上实现了 8.4% 的提升。

Conclusion: 半径减少能够实现忠实的多尺度表示，从而推进 zero-shot 图学习。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型在深度强化学习（DRL）中表现下降，这是由于独特的优化病理，如可塑性损失。虽然最近的研究表明，在训练过程中动态调整网络拓扑可以缓解这些问题，但现有的研究存在三个关键限制：(1) 在所有模块中应用统一的动态训练策略，尽管编码器、评论员和演员遵循不同的学习模式，(2) 侧重于基本架构的评估，而没有明确动态训练和架构改进之间相对重要性和相互作用，(3) 缺乏对不同动态方法（包括稀疏到稀疏、密集到稀疏和稀疏到密集）之间的系统比较。

Method: 通过对模块和架构的全面调查，揭示了动态稀疏训练策略提供了模块特定的好处，这些好处补充了架构改进所建立的主要可扩展性基础。最后，将这些见解提炼成一个模块化训练（MST）框架，该框架进一步利用了架构改进的优势。

Result: 提出的模块化训练（MST）框架在各种RL算法中展示了显著的可扩展性提升，而无需进行算法修改。

Conclusion: 动态稀疏训练策略提供了模块特定的好处，可以补充架构改进所建立的可扩展性基础。

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chimera是一种统一的模型，可以直接整合数据拓扑结构，无需领域特定的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的深度学习方法忽略了数据的邻域结构或图拓扑，需要引入额外的归纳偏置，而设计这些偏置需要大量的努力，并且会引入副作用，阻碍泛化。

Method: 将状态空间模型推广到可以捕获任何图拓扑结构。

Result: Chimera在语言、视觉和图等领域都取得了很好的效果，在GLUE上超过BERT 0.7个点，在ImageNet-1k上超过ViT 2.6%，并且在Long Range Graph Benchmark上超过了所有基线。

Conclusion: 数据拓扑结构是一种强大的跨模态归纳偏置。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Motivation: 解决GPR训练的高计算成本问题。

Method: 利用预处理共轭梯度法加速GPR中线性求解的收敛；利用输入数据中的聚类来识别协方差矩阵的块对角结构，并构造低秩逼近；采用数值梯度来优化GPR模型的超参数；利用CUDA工具包在NVIDIA GPU上高效地并行化训练过程。

Conclusion: nuGPR框架有效地降低了GPR训练的计算成本和内存消耗。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Motivation: 现有图少样本学习方法依赖于预定义的统一图滤波器，无法适应真实图的局部拓扑结构异质性。此外，它们通常假设支持集和查询集来自同一分布，这在少样本条件下可能导致泛化能力下降。

Result: 实验结果表明，GRACE在各种实验设置中始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: GRACE通过适应局部结构变化和跨集分布校准，提高了模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

Motivation: 联邦学习在提供参与者对其训练数据的独立性的同时，容易受到中毒攻击，并且由于不同的数据分布或数据中存在的历史偏差，这种协作也会在参与者之间传播偏差，即使是无意的。

Method: 通过解决公平性指标（如人口平等等）的优化问题来计算公平性损失。

Result: 通过在各种设置中，针对不同的数据集评估我们的攻击，反对最先进的拜占庭鲁棒和公平感知聚合方案，实验结果表明，即使在FL系统中存在单个恶意客户端的情况下，通过将偏差提高到90％来提高攻击效果。

Conclusion: 该攻击是阴险且难以检测的，因为它即使在增加偏差后也能保持全局准确性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

Method: 本文提出了一个极简的推理框架，用于支持小型transformer的自验证反思，该框架不使用自然语言，以确保分析清晰并降低实验成本。

Result: 实验表明，仅有数百万参数的小型transformer可以通过自验证在训练和反思执行中获益，并在整数乘法和数独游戏中达到显著的LLM水平性能。强化学习（RL）可以提高小模型的性能并鼓励反思，但RL主要优化浅层统计模式，而不能真正减少验证错误。

Conclusion: 无论规模和自然语言如何，将生成式transformer与判别式验证相结合，都有助于CoT推理。

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了基于元学习的样本重加权方法在噪声标签下的理论行为，并提出了一个轻量级的替代方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过参数化网络容易记忆噪声标签，而基于元学习的样本重加权可以缓解这个问题，但缺乏理论理解。

Method: 本文对元重加权进行了理论分析，揭示了其训练过程的三个阶段，并提出了一种轻量级的替代方法，该方法集成了均值中心化、行移位和标签符号调制。

Result: 提出的方法在合成和真实的噪声标签基准测试中，始终优于强大的重加权/选择基线。

Conclusion: 本文的理论分析为理解元重加权提供了 insights，并提出的轻量级替代方法在实践中表现良好。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

*Tao Xie,Zexi Tan,Haoyi Xiao,Binbin Sun,Yiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DE3S的医学早期时间序列分类框架，旨在解决准确性和及时性的冲突，并提高ICU资源利用率和医疗保健精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗应用中，特别是ICU中的脓毒症预测，早期时间序列分类至关重要，但现有方法难以兼顾准确性和及时性，并且难以捕捉到微弱的早期模式和类别不平衡。

Method: 该论文提出了双重增强软稀疏形状学习（DE3S）框架，通过结合时间增强和基于注意力的全局时间增强，利用基于注意力评分的软Shapelet稀疏化机制，并采用双路径混合专家网络（MoE）和Inception模块融合架构来精确地提取Shapelet。

Result: 在六个真实世界医疗数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法具有最先进的性能，并且消融研究证实了组件的有效性。

Conclusion: DE3S框架在医学早期时间序列分类中表现出色，能够有效解决准确性和及时性的冲突，并具有良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层库普曼扩散，以实现一步采样和可解释的生成轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在高保真图像生成方面取得了令人瞩目的成功，但由于其固有的迭代去噪过程，采样速度较慢。最近的一步法虽然通过学习直接的噪声到图像的映射来加速推理，但牺牲了解释性和扩散动力学固有的细粒度控制。

Method: 该方法基于库普曼算子理论，将非线性扩散动力学提升到潜在空间，在该空间中，演化由全局线性算子控制，从而实现闭式轨迹解。

Result: 分层库普曼扩散不仅实现了有竞争力的单步生成性能，而且还为通过频谱分析解释和操纵生成过程提供了一个有原则的机制。

Conclusion: 我们的框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样和可解释性之间的差距，为生成模型中可解释的图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在处理图结构数据方面非常有效，但容易受到对抗攻击。以往的研究主要集中在攻击图的结构或文本属性，而忽略了两者之间的联系。

Method: 本文提出的IMDGA框架，通过三个紧密集成的模块，平衡了可解释性和攻击效果，从而更好地理解Graph-LLM的脆弱性。

Result: IMDGA在可解释性、攻击有效性、隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了Graph-LLM中一个以前未被充分探索的语义维度漏洞，为提高其弹性提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and
resources are publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MoRA的分子感知低秩适应方法，用于将分子图结构与大型语言模型(LLM)有效集成，它为每个输入分子图生成一组独特的低秩适应权重，这些权重被动态注入到冻结的LLM中，使模型能够根据每个分子输入的结构调整其推理，同时保留LLM的核心知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态对齐方法通常通过微调LLM或同时添加静态适配器来处理分子图结构，但这些方法有两个主要限制：(1)它优化了所有分子输入的共享参数空间，限制了模型捕获特定实例结构特征的能力；(2)为分子任务微调LLM可能导致灾难性遗忘，从而破坏其一般推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种实例特定的参数空间对齐方法，称为分子感知低秩适应(MoRA)，为每个输入分子图动态生成一组低秩适应权重，并将这些权重动态注入到冻结的LLM中。

Result: 在关键分子任务(如化学反应预测和分子描述)中，MoRA的实例特定动态适应优于静态适应基线，例如，反应预测精确匹配相对提高了14.1%，量子性质预测的误差降低了22%。

Conclusion: MoRA方法能够有效地将分子图结构与LLM集成，并在分子任务中取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在表现性学习中，数据分布会对已部署的模型做出反应，从而产生比传统监督学习更复杂的动态。因此，不仅要针对当前数据优化模型，还要考虑到模型可能会将分布引导到新的方向。

Method: 在高维岭回归中研究正则化对表现性效应的影响。

Result: 表明虽然表现性效应会恶化总体设置中的测试风险，但在特征数量超过样本数量的过度参数化的情况下，它们可能是有益的。最优正则化与表现性效应的总体强度相关。

Conclusion: 可以通过设置正则化来预测表现性效应。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively
maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for
papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.
