Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve\nthoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge.

To further optimize the performance, we\nintroduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust\nthe weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and\nExponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely\nproportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively\ncontrols weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.\nFurthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining\nnon-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.\nUltimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring\nfine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.\nExtensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and\nTiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with\nstate-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches.

The final published\n  version will be available at the ACM Digital Library", "summary": "Modern sequential recommender systems, ranging from lightweight\ntransformer-based variants to large language models, have become increasingly\nprominent in academia and industry due to their strong performance in the\nnext-item prediction task. Yet common evaluation protocols for sequential\nrecommendations remain insufficiently developed: they often fail to reflect the\ncorresponding recommendation task accurately, or are not aligned with\nreal-world scenarios.\n  Although the widely used leave-one-out split matches next-item prediction, it\npermits the overlap between training and test periods, which leads to temporal\nleakage and unrealistically long test horizon, limiting real-world relevance.\nGlobal temporal splitting addresses these issues by evaluating on distinct\nfuture periods. However, its applications to sequential recommendations remain\nloosely defined, particularly in terms of selecting target interactions and\nconstructing a validation subset that provides necessary consistency between\nvalidation and test metrics.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes can vary significantly\nacross splitting strategies, influencing model rankings and practical\ndeployment decisions. To improve reproducibility in both academic and\nindustrial settings, we systematically compare different splitting strategies\nfor sequential recommendations across multiple datasets and established\nbaselines. Our findings show that prevalent splits, such as leave-one-out, may\nbe insufficiently aligned with more realistic evaluation strategies.

However,\nthese claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different\nscenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric\nvision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This\nraises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems\nfrom the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the\ndomain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new\nbenchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy\nenables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person\nperspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity\nunderstanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of\ndifficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted\nadvancements on this task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u533a\u5206\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u4eba\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u56f0\u96be\u6765\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u4eba\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u6e90\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u6e90\u4e8e\u4eba\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u9886\u57df\uff1f", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u5f00\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u4e0e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eba\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u56f0\u96be\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u4e0e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eba\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u4e86\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u56f0\u96be\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

In this paper, we\nrigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using\nConditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce\nthe Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose\nRectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces\nfactorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target\ndistributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a\nmonotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence.

Williams"], "title": "The Recursive Coherence Principle: A Formal Constraint on Scalable Intelligence, Alignment, and Reasoning Architecture", "comment": null, "summary": "Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural\ncoherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers.

Using five open-source LLMs, we\nsystematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically\nrole adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM\nsimulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and\nclosed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate\nmarginalized groups, particularly nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern\nidentities, but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption\nstrategy significantly impacts their portrayal.

However,\nintegrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased\ncomputational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded\nsegmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues\nundermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly\nin complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is\nessential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal\nNetwork (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and\nefficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM\ninput pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder\n(ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific\ncharacteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich\ncontextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse\nstructural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric\nPrior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion\nprocess, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features.\nAdditionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal\ncompatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence\nminimization.

Although most methods aim to enhance\nthe global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism,\nthey tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense\nprediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local\nfeatures as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question\nthat merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model,\nAtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local\ndetails with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically,\nour method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a\ngradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design\nshortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to\neffectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By\nleveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design\ndedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD)\nand semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD,\nrespectively.

By examining the\ncross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts\nbetween neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In\nresponse, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that\nleverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to\ndynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. Our SaaS\nenhances instruction-following fidelity without requiring additional training\nor test-time optimization. Experimental results on instruction-based image\nediting and visual conditional image generation validate the effectiveness of\nour SaaS, showing superior instruction-following fidelity over existing\nmethods.

We\nempirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in\ndistinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a\nhallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer\nevolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe\nachieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore,\nablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying\nmechanism of this method, improving its interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faICR\u8bc4\u5206\u548cICR\u63a2\u9488\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7528\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u548c\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5373ICR\u8bc4\u5206\uff08\u4fe1\u606f\u8d21\u732e\u5230\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373ICR\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5b83\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "ICR\u8bc4\u5206\u5728\u533a\u5206\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u6709\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cICR\u63a2\u9488\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ICR\u63a2\u9488\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u83b7\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e95\u5c42\u673a\u5236\u7684\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image\ngeneration quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized\napplications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic\npretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven\nunlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,\nthey are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal\nthat state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even\nwhen fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets.

For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments\nactions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of\nactions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual\nfeatures at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes.\nFinally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both\nvideo-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross multipe FSAR benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "LGA\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5256\u6790\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u5256\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u955c\u5934\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c11\u91cf\u955c\u5934\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b (FSAR) \u65e8\u5728\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6700\u8fd1\u5c06\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6587\u672c\uff09\u7eb3\u5165\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u59ff\u52bf\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\u662f\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5185\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u52a8\u4f5c\u89e3\u5256 (LGA)\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u6765\u5256\u6790\u9690\u85cf\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8868\u5f81\u7279\u5f81\u3002LGA\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u5c11\u91cf\u955c\u5934\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u793a\u4e00\u4e2a\u73b0\u6210\u7684LLM\u5c06\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u7d20\uff08\u4e3b\u4f53\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\uff09\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u5256\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u6210\u539f\u5b50\u89c6\u9891\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u539f\u578b\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c6\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u9891-\u6587\u672c\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5c11\u955c\u5934\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLGA\u5728\u591a\u4e2aFSAR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LGA\u5728\u591a\u4e2aFSAR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model\ndesigned for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of\ndownstream tasks.

However, existing studies focus solely on the\nrelationships between samples with known survival risks, without fully\nleveraging the value of censored samples. Furthermore, these studies may suffer\nperformance degradation in modality-missing scenarios and even struggle during\nthe inference process. In this study, we propose a bipartite patient-modality\ngraph learning with event-conditional modelling of censoring for cancer\nsurvival prediction (CenSurv). Specifically, we first use graph structure to\nmodel multimodal data and obtain representation. Then, to alleviate performance\ndegradation in modality-missing scenarios, we design a bipartite graph to\nsimulate the patient-modality relationship in various modality-missing\nscenarios and leverage a complete-incomplete alignment strategy to explore\nmodality-agnostic features. Finally, we design a plug-and-play\nevent-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) that selects reliable censored\ndata using dynamic momentum accumulation confidences, assigns more accurate\nsurvival times to these censored data, and incorporates them as uncensored data\ninto training. Comprehensive evaluations on 5 publicly cancer datasets showcase\nthe superiority of CenSurv over the best state-of-the-art by 3.1% in terms of\nthe mean C-index, while also exhibiting excellent robustness under various\nmodality-missing scenarios. In addition, using the plug-and-play ECMC module,\nthe mean C-index of 8 baselines increased by 1.3% across 5 datasets.

To address these limitations, we make\nthe initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model\n(M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from\nlarge-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new\ninsights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies\ninto a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information\nimbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity\n(CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then\nwe develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible,\neasy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process.

Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,\nSFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation\nand unification.

Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage\nlimited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate\nsegmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to\nstructure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by\npseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for\nsemi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we\nsummarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems\nand employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between\nmodalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals\ncan be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity.

We also develop\nthe RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial\nsignals on multiple health management tasks.

To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,\napproaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize\nrestoration quality.

The DFB employs adaptive\ncomponent processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for\nconsistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for\nfine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent\nrestoration and blurring issues.
