The\nability to identify outliers in data streams is essential for maintaining data\nquality and detecting faults.

While numerous methods have been proposed to\ntackle this challenge, a common drawback is the lack of straightforward\nparameterization in many of them. This article introduces two novel methods:\nDyCF and DyCG. DyCF leverages the Christoffel function from the theory of\napproximation and orthogonal polynomials. Conversely, DyCG capitalizes on the\ngrowth properties of the Christoffel function, eliminating the need for tuning\nparameters. Both approaches are firmly rooted in a well-defined algebraic\nframework, meeting crucial demands for data stream processing, with a specific\nfocus on addressing low-dimensional aspects and maintaining data history\nwithout memory cost. A comprehensive comparison between DyCF, DyCG, and\nstate-of-the-art methods is presented, using both synthetic and real industrial\ndata streams.

Given that users\noften prioritize specific accuracy levels, efficiently identifying the optimal\nPG configurations to meet these targets is essential.

Therefore, inspired by the human ability for\nsaid tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance\nreasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of\nan incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process\nenables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to\nincorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid\nand which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with\nautomated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be\nintegrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in\nthe process.

A highly infectious\ncommunicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,\nthe World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A\npandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was\nnot prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people\nworldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the\nrespiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive\nresearch, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being\nlost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying\ngasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as\nthere was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and\nventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of\nthis project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the\npatient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less\nprone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to\ngive better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a\nConvolutional Neural Network model.

However,\nthis challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting\nof old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity\nRepresentations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN\nexplicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a\nfine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order\nInteraction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific\nfeatures from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation\nstream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared\nacross all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a\nmulti-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained\nknowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting\nand alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,\nwe design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy.

Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models\nrely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to\nassess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible\nassessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,\nhuman-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to\nreplicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in\ntext-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization\nof debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct\ntext-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a\ngiven utility and vice-versa.

Despite their varied\narchitectures, many share a common foundation in probabilistic latent variable\nmodels (PLVMs), where hidden variables explain observed data for density\nestimation, latent reasoning, and structured inference. This paper presents a\nunified perspective by framing both classical and modern generative methods\nwithin the PLVM paradigm. We trace the progression from classical flat models\nsuch as probabilistic PCA, Gaussian mixture models, latent class analysis, item\nresponse theory, and latent Dirichlet allocation, through their sequential\nextensions including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian HMMs, and Linear Dynamical\nSystems, to contemporary deep architectures: Variational Autoencoders as Deep\nPLVMs, Normalizing Flows as Tractable PLVMs, Diffusion Models as Sequential\nPLVMs, Autoregressive Models as Explicit Generative Models, and Generative\nAdversarial Networks as Implicit PLVMs. Viewing these architectures under a\ncommon probabilistic taxonomy reveals shared principles, distinct inference\nstrategies, and the representational trade-offs that shape their strengths.

In real-world applications such as\nonline advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with\ndifferent users focusing on different features. This underscores the\nsignificant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation. Effective\npersonalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately\nmodeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation\nprocess while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency\nand scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios.\nAdditionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice\ncomplicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle. We\npropose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest\nmodeling and personalized content generation. During inference, a combination\nof user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is\nemployed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce\ncomputational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale\ndeployment. Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on\nchain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific\ncreative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized\ndata. This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of\nour model. Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin\nSearch Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator.

We propose ReProCon, a novel few-shot NER framework that combines\nmulti-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile\nmeta-learning to tackle these issues. By representing each category with\nmultiple prototypes, ReProCon captures semantic variability, such as synonyms\nand contextual differences, while a cosine-contrastive objective ensures strong\ninterclass separation. Reptile meta-updates enable quick adaptation with little\ndata. Using a lightweight fastText + BiLSTM encoder with much lower memory\nusage, ReProCon achieves a macro-$F_1$ score close to BERT-based baselines\n(around 99 percent of BERT performance).

However, conventional DNN training\ntypically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on\nedge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To\naddress this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),\nnamed NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting\ndimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling\nin the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based\nmethods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,\nNMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method\nand the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the\nemergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,\ntarget perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and\nleading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of\nexamplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose\nAdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the\nFireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided\noptimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative\ntraining samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the\nedge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and\nentropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and\ntime-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAdapSNE\u7684DNN-free\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DNNs\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709NMS\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fa7\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684DNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684NMS\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u964d\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5373\u76ee\u6807\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff09\u662f\u51ed\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\u7684\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdapSNE\uff0c\u5b83\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u70df\u82b1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08FWA\uff09\u548c\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "AdapSNE\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u548c\u5f3a\u5236\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u663e\u7740\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u9762\u79ef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdapSNE\uff0c\u5b83\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u5373\u70df\u82b1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08FWA\uff09\u2014\u2014\u6765\u6291\u5236\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u4fdd\u5177\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u964d\u4f4eFWA\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fa7\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u7740\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u9762\u79ef\u3002"}}

The technical report for the paper titled \"Effective\n  Clustering for Large Multi-Relational Graphs\" in SIGMOD 2026", "summary": "Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling\ndiverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade\nextensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning\nthe node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in\nanalyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the\nmajority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised\nresult quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and\nattributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and\nbillions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning\nmodels.\n  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to\naddress the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel\ntwo-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive\nhigh-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet\nenergy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of\nclustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves\nsignificantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM\nthrough a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions\ninclude (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node\nfeature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with\ncarefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without\nexplicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend\nDEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations.

However, while explainable approaches can help\nunderstand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the\nunderlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many\npractitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency\nwith a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers\nactionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.\nCounterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by\nshowing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We\npropose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a\nnovel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual\nmethods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model\nusing an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used\nto generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original\nunderlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding\nthe ``effort\" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to\ncausal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides\na more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a\nfavourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and\nactionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all\nwhile having a lower cost.

Model compression techniques\nare essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained\nenvironments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating\nweight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix\nreconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's\nfunctional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing\nmethods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during\ncompression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank\nDecomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a\nprimary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank\ncorrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual\nerror. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and\nLlama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to\n51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,\nconsistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse.

In response,\nwe propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,\ndesigned to handle multiple degradations through global and local text\nperception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a\nglobal feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract\noverall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting\ngeneralization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,\nthe local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to\nconcentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,\nthereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to\nconstrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network\nlearning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby\npromoting the learning of more meaningful visual features.

However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate\nstable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex\ninteractions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a\ncomputational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates\ngenerative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to\ninvestigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation\nemerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that\nagents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and\ndisplay distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse\nstrategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively\ndismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct\nself-organized community boundaries based on these stances.

Current methods, relying on symbolic\nregression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual\nphenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to\nphysicists. This \"sensory deprivation\" severely weakens their ability to\ninterpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To\naddress this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual\nInduction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic\nformulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic\nreasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via\na curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning\nto interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a\nCausal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration\n(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During\ninference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a\nhigh-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic\nregression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final\nstep, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the\ntheoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce\nPhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that\nVIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy\nand interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws.

The key idea is to embed the\nelements in a way that maximizes their mutual information, thereby preserving\nthe original dependency structure as much as possible. This approach can be\nnaturally extended to cases involving three or more domains, using a\ngeneralization of mutual information known as total correlation. For\ninter-domain analysis, we also propose a visualization method that assigns\ncolors to the latent spaces based on conditional probabilities, allowing users\nto explore asymmetric relationships interactively.

Reward\nhacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to\noverwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study\nthe behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand\nexamples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as\nwriting poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to\ntrain models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on\nthese tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new\nsettings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward\nfunctions to maximize reward.

Next, players' movement initiations\nwere detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting\nthe timing of movements using rule-based approaches.

The anchor prediction is projected\ninto a latent space, where a learnable metric-window kernel scores locality and\na soft router dispatches each sample to a small set of mixture-density-network\nexperts; the experts produce a heteroscedastic correction and predictive\nvariance. We train by minimizing negative log-likelihood, and on a disjoint\ncalibration split fit a post-hoc linear map on predicted means to improve point\naccuracy.

Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current\nLVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and\nreasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise\nimage region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To\naddress these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding\nLVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine\ncognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global\nContextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained\nLocal Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement\nModule to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator\nto ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an\nadaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for\nrobust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,\nincluding GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring\nExpression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4.

Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving\nPDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that\ndirectly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher\nrunning cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide\nmaterial design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead\nis amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a\nfocus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace,\nHelmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we\npropose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable.\nOur method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism,\nwhich analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to\nits effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes\nand analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast\nExpansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels\nfrom structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave\npropagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful\nsensitivity information useful for material design.

Our framework provides a\nscalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and\nefficient alternative to traditional approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u56fe\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u56fe\u5230\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u5339\u914d\u662f\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u6e90\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b83\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u83b7\u53d6\u6807\u8bb0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5730\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4f2a\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u5750\u6807\u6355\u83b7\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u7b2c\u4e09\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u5608\u6742\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5750\u6807\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u74e6\u7247\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u548c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5927\u5927\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5730\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5065\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
