TL;DR: enriching transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such as age, gender, and emotion, using frozen audio foundation models with a frozen LLAMA language model


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: improve transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire dialogue, while some are time-variant.

Method: coupling frozen audio foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and language representations

Result: achieve competitive performance on speaker profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed

Conclusion: A frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

### [2] [Parity-Aware Byte-Pair Encoding: Improving Cross-lingual Fairness in Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04796)
*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parity-aware BPE, a variant of the widely-used BPE algorithm, maximizes the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with <UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To remedy this

Method: Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

Result: Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE can lead to more equitable token counts across languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

*David Sasu,Natalie Schluter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过联合训练ASR和音调重音检测，提高了ASR性能，表明韵律线索很重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用半监督语音表示的自动语音识别（ASR）系统的性能可以通过互补的音调重音检测模块来提高。

Method: 引入联合ASR和音调重音检测模型

Result: 音调重音检测模块在F1分数上缩小了41%的差距，达到了最先进水平的显著改进。在有限的资源微调下，联合训练中的ASR性能在LibriSpeech上降低了28.3%的WER。

Conclusion: 通过联合训练ASR和音调重音检测模型，ASR性能得到了显著提升，证明了保留或重新学习音调重音等韵律线索的重要性。

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to
retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在行为上不稳定，因此基于人格的对齐策略可能不适用于安全关键型应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要一致的行为模式以实现安全部署，但其类人格特征仍然知之甚少。

Method: 使用传统和新颖的LLM改编的个性工具，系统地改变问题顺序、释义、角色和推理模式，评估了25+开源模型（1B-671B参数）在500,000+响应中的表现。

Result: 即使是400B+的模型也表现出显著的响应变异性；轻微的提示重新排序会使个性测量发生高达20%的偏移；旨在稳定行为的干预措施，如思维链推理、详细的角色指令、包含对话历史记录，反而会增加变异性；LLM改编的工具与以人为中心的版本表现出相同的不稳定性，证实了架构而非翻译的局限性。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型缺乏真正的行为一致性的基础，对于需要可预测行为的安全关键型应用，基于个性化的对齐策略可能在根本上是不够的。

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCR-Router 是一种用于多智能体 LLM 的上下文路由框架，它减少了 token 使用，同时提高了答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体大型语言模型（LLM）系统中的协调方案依赖于静态或全上下文路由策略，导致过多的 token 消耗、冗余的记忆暴露以及跨交互轮次的有限适应性。

Method: RCR-Router，一个模块化和角色感知的上下文路由框架，它基于角色和任务阶段为每个智能体动态选择语义相关的记忆子集，同时遵守严格的 token 预算。一个轻量级的评分策略指导记忆选择，智能体输出被迭代地集成到一个共享记忆存储中，以促进渐进式上下文细化。

Result: 在三个多跳 QA 基准测试（HotPotQA、MuSiQue 和 2WikiMultihop）上的实验表明，RCR-Router 减少了 token 使用（高达 30%），同时提高或保持了答案质量。

Conclusion: RCR-Router 通过结构化记忆路由和输出感知评估，在减少 token 使用的同时，提高或保持了答案质量，从而推进了可扩展的多智能体 LLM 系统。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

*Julia Kharchenko,Tanya Roosta,Aman Chadha,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging language, despite equivalent content quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender, social class, or regional background.

Method: Through carefully constructed interview simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of demographic bias in automated evaluation systems.

Result: hedged responses receive 25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness in identifying model-specific biases.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundational framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems, with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

### [7] [Towards Robust Evaluation of Visual Activity Recognition: Resolving Verb Ambiguity with Sense Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04945)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了视觉-语言聚类框架以解决视觉活动识别系统评估中的歧义问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于动词语义和图像解释中固有的歧义，评估视觉活动识别系统具有挑战性。标准精确匹配评估无法捕捉到这些歧义，从而导致对模型性能的不完整评估。

Method: 视觉-语言聚类框架

Result: 对 imSitu 数据集的分析表明，每个图像平均映射到 2.8 个意义聚类，每个聚类代表图像的不同视角。聚类评估与人类判断更好地吻合，从而可以更细致地评估模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于视觉-语言聚类的框架，该框架构建了动词意义聚类，从而提供更强大的评估。

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多阶段大型语言模型框架，以增强从非结构化文本中提取健康社会决定因素 (SDoH)，从而提高准确性和透明度，并支持早期识别高危个体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解导致自杀事件的健康社会决定因素 (SDoH) 对于早期干预和预防至关重要。然而，实现这一目标的数据驱动方法面临着诸如长尾因素分布、分析自杀事件前的关键应激源以及模型可解释性有限等挑战。

Method: 提出了一个多阶段大型语言模型框架，以增强从非结构化文本中提取 SDoH 因素。该方法与其他最先进的语言模型（即，预训练的 BioBERT 和 GPT-3.5-turbo）和推理模型（即，DeepSeek-R1）进行了比较。

Result: 该框架在提取 SDoH 因素的总体任务和检索相关上下文的更精细任务中均表现出性能提升。此外，微调一个较小的、特定于任务的模型可以实现可比或更好的性能，同时降低推理成本。多阶段设计不仅增强了提取，还提供了中间解释，从而提高了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了从非结构化文本中提取与自杀相关的 SDoH 的准确性和透明度。这些进步有可能支持早期识别高危个体，并为更有效的预防策略提供信息。

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

### [9] [Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction via Structural Entropy Minimization Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05023)
*Kun Peng,Cong Cao,Hao Peng,Zhifeng Hao,Lei Jiang,Kongjing Gu,Yanbing Liu,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) that partitions dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues using structural entropy minimization and then extracts quadruples in two steps, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods learn word relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment elements, but dialogues often contain multiple semantically independent sub-dialogues, introducing noise.

Method: A structural entropy minimization algorithm is used to partition dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues. A two-step framework extracts sentiment elements at the utterance level and then matches quadruples at the sub-dialogue level.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with lower computational costs.

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates finetuning four distinct LLM architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled for AMR parsing and finds that LLaMA 3.2 demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a straightforward finetuning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing

Method: straightforward finetuning of decoder only LLMs

Result: LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5 excels in structural validity.

Conclusion: decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2 demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

*Jinda Liu,Bo Cheng,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了在多任务学习中使用复杂多适配器/头结构的范式，提出了Align-LoRA，通过学习鲁棒的共享表示来实现有效的MTL泛化，并在实验中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）通常需要处理来自多个领域的各种任务，这种情况自然可以通过多任务学习（MTL）来解决。在MTL环境中，一个主要的趋势是使用具有多个适配器或头的LoRA变体，这些变体提倡结构多样性以捕获特定于任务的知识。

Method: 提出Align-LoRA，它包含一个显式损失，以对齐共享适配器空间内的任务表示。

Result: 一个简化的具有高头间相似性的多头架构明显优于复杂的多适配器和多头系统。标准的单适配器LoRA，具有足够增加的秩，也实现了高度竞争的性能。Align-LoRA显著超越所有基线。

Conclusion: Align-LoRA通过在共享适配器空间内对齐任务表示，显著超越所有基线，为将LLM适配到多个任务建立了一个更简单但更有效的范例。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at
https://github.com/jinda-liu/Align-LoRA.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'MultiCheck', a multimodal fact verification framework, and achieves strong performance on the Factify 2 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems that rely primarily on textual evidence.

Method: The paper proposed a unified framework called 'MultiCheck' that combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion module and a classification head, supported by a contrastive learning objective.

Result: The approach achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.84 on the Factify 2 dataset, outperforming the baseline.

Conclusion: The results on the Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, highlight the effectiveness of explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of the approach for scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

*Yuhao Wang,Ruiyang Ren,Yucheng Wang,Jing Liu,Wayne Xin Zhao,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes BEE-RAG, a balanced entropy-engineered RAG framework, to improve the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the principle of entropy invariance. It addresses the issue of unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution in long retrieval contexts. The effectiveness of BEE-RAG is demonstrated through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG tends to operate with long context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval context as significant factors affecting RAG performance.

Method: balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal balancing factor for different settings.

Result: BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from context length, ensuring a stable entropy level.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments across multiple RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型对输入信息的位置敏感，靠前和靠后的信息关注度更高。AttnRank通过重新排序输入信息来提高模型性能，无需训练且计算开销小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的性能对输入中信息的情境位置非常敏感。为了研究这种位置偏差背后的机制，我们进行了广泛的实验，揭示了一种一致的现象，我们称之为注意力盆地：当呈现一系列结构化项目（例如，检索到的文档或少样本示例）时，模型系统地将更高的注意力分配给序列的开头和结尾的项目，而忽略了中间的项目。

Method: 提出了Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank)，这是一个两阶段框架，(i) 使用小校准集估计模型的内在位置注意力偏好，以及 (ii) 重新排序检索到的文档或少样本示例，以将最显著的内容与这些高注意力位置对齐。

Result: 分析表明，将更高的注意力分配给关键信息是提高模型性能的关键。AttnRank是一种模型无关、免训练和即插即用的方法，计算开销极小。

Conclusion: AttnRank在多跳问答和少样本上下文学习任务中取得了显著的改进，适用于各种架构和规模的10个大型语言模型，无需修改模型参数或训练程序。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

TL;DR: PrinciplismQA是一个用于评估大型语言模型在医疗伦理方面的基准，揭示了模型在伦理知识和实际应用之间的差距，并强调了医学领域微调的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大型语言模型整合到医疗保健中需要对其伦理推理进行严格评估，而当前的基准测试通常会忽略这一点。

Method: 引入PrinciplismQA，这是一个包含3,648个问题的综合基准，旨在系统地评估LLM与核心医学伦理的一致性。

Result: 实验表明，在模型的伦理知识和实际应用之间存在显着差距，尤其是在将伦理原则动态应用于实际场景时。大多数LLM都在有关“行善”的困境中挣扎，经常过度强调其他原则。具有强大通用功能的 Frontier 闭源模型目前处于领先地位。值得注意的是，医学领域微调可以增强模型的整体伦理能力，但进一步的进展需要更好地与医学伦理知识保持一致。

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA提供了一个可扩展的框架，可以诊断这些特定的伦理弱点，为更平衡和负责任的医疗AI铺平道路。

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Conclusion: MulCoT-RD模型在资源受限的JMSRC任务上表现出色，仅用3B参数就在四个数据集上取得了强大的性能，同时展示了强大的泛化能力和增强的可解释性。

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

TL;DR: propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within LLMs in this study


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structured pruning methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.

Method: treat an LLM as a digital brain and decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving the key neurons within these functional networks.

Result: enabling efficient model pruning

Conclusion: The proposed method can successfully identify and locate functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

TL;DR: CodeBoost是一个后训练框架，它纯粹从代码片段增强代码LLM，而无需人工注释的指令，并通过各种技术提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码大型语言模型（LLM）已成为构建高效和自动化编码管道不可或缺的工具。现有的模型通常使用来自通用LLM的强化学习（RL），使用“人工指令-最终答案”对进行后训练，其中指令通常来自手动注释。然而，收集高质量的编码指令既费力又难以扩展。另一方面，代码片段可以从各种来源大量获得。这种不平衡在基于指令的后训练中提出了一个主要的瓶颈。

Method: CodeBoost，一个后训练框架，它纯粹从代码片段增强代码LLM，而不依赖于人工注释的指令。CodeBoost引入了以下关键组件：（1）最大集团管理，它从代码中选择具有代表性和多样性的训练语料库；（2）双向预测，使模型能够从前向和后向预测目标中学习；（3）误差感知预测，它结合了来自正确和不正确输出的学习信号；（4）异构增强，它使训练分布多样化，以丰富代码语义；（5）异构奖励，它通过包括格式正确性和来自成功和失败的执行反馈在内的多种奖励类型来指导模型学习。

Result: CodeBoost持续提高性能，证明了其作为可扩展和有效的训练管道的有效性。

Conclusion: CodeBoost通过多个代码LLM和基准测试的广泛实验验证，持续提高性能，证明了其作为可扩展和有效的训练管道的有效性。

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Errors in later stages of CoT are more critical. ASCoT addresses this with adaptive verification and correction, improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of reasoning chains remains a critical challenge.

Method: Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE).

Result: errors introduced in the later stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer than identical errors made at the beginning.

Conclusion: ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong baselines, including standard CoT.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

TL;DR: This paper explores using dialogue agents to assist meta-reviewers. It addresses data scarcity by generating synthetic dialogues with LLMs and shows that agents trained on this data improve meta-reviewing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-reviewing is a decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments, and decision-makers can be effectively assisted via dialogue agents. The paper explores the practical challenges for realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers.

Method: The paper generates synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a self-refinement strategy to address data scarcity and trains dialogue agents tailored for meta-reviewing.

Result: The experiments show that the proposed method produces higher-quality synthetic data and the trained dialogue agents outperform off-the-shelf LLM-based assistants. The agents are also effective in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of dialogue agents in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing, especially when trained on synthetic data generated by LLMs using a self-refinement strategy.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting a sequence of sentence-level embeddings, but it has a diffusion sampler. This paper aims to retain the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal.

Method: A decoder-only transformer is trained with token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder, using a hybrid objective that combines semantic abstraction and likelihood-based training.

Result: SONAR-LLM attains competitive generation quality. Scaling trends, ablations, and benchmark results are reported. Complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints are released.

Conclusion: SONAR-LLM achieves competitive generation quality across model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters.

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGRS mitigates overthinking in LRLMs by suppressing reflection triggers based on confidence, reducing token usage without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) suffer from overthinking, leading to redundant reasoning steps, increased token usage and inference costs.

Method: Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), dynamically suppressing reflection triggers based on model confidence.

Result: CGRS reduces token usage by 18.5%-41.9% while preserving accuracy across four reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures. It also achieves a better balance between length reduction and performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS) effectively reduces token usage (18.5%-41.9%) while preserving accuracy across various models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 本研究调查了在 Microsoft Hololens 2 设备上向现有手语 (SL) 头像添加调整功能的影响。

Method: 通过对专家德国手语 (DGS) 用户在特定用例中与可调节和不可调节头像的交互进行详细分析

Result: 尽管用户偏爱可调节设置，但未观察到 UX 或可理解性的显着提高，由于缺少 SL 元素（口型和面部表情）和实施问题（不清楚的手形、缺乏反馈和菜单定位），UX 或可理解性仍然处于较低水平。享乐质量高于实用质量，表明用户发现该系统在情感上或美学上比功能上更有用。可调节头像的压力水平更高，反映了较低的性能、更大的努力和更多的挫折感。此外，人们还担心 Hololens 调整手势是否直观且易于熟悉。虽然对可调节性概念的接受度总体上是积极的，但它强烈依赖于可用性和动画质量。

Conclusion: 个性化本身是不够的，SL 头像必须默认是可理解的。主要建议包括增强口型和面部动画，改进交互界面，以及应用参与式设计。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

Motivation: LLMs often have cultural biases from training data, challenging accurate representation in low-resource languages.

Method: Introduce MyCulture, a benchmark using open-ended multiple-choice questions in Bahasa Melayu.

Result: Evaluation reveals disparities in cultural comprehension.

Conclusion: LLMs show cultural comprehension disparities, needing culturally grounded benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMEval-3 是一个用于动态评估 LLM 的框架，可解决静态基准测试中的数据污染问题，从而提供对模型性能的更准确评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准上对大型语言模型 (LLM) 的现有评估容易受到数据污染和排行榜过度拟合的影响，这些关键问题掩盖了模型的真实能力。

Method: LLMEval-3 建立在 22 万个研究生级别问题的专有库之上，从中为每次评估运行动态采样未见过的测试集。 它的自动化管道通过抗污染数据管理、一种新颖的反作弊架构以及与人类专家达成 90% 一致的校准 LLM 即法官流程来确保完整性，并辅以用于公平比较的相对排名系统。

Result: 一项对近 50 个领先模型进行的为期 20 个月的纵向研究揭示了知识记忆的性能上限，并揭示了静态基准无法检测到的数据污染漏洞。 该框架在排名稳定性和一致性方面表现出卓越的稳健性，为动态评估范例提供了强大的经验验证。

Conclusion: LLMEval-3 提供了一种稳健且可信的方法，用于评估 LLM 的真实能力，超越了排行榜分数，并促进了更值得信赖的评估标准的开发。

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

TL;DR: TASE: a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' token-level understanding, reveals LLMs' weakness compared to human.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with fine-grained, token-level understanding and structural reasoning, which are essential for applications requiring precision and control.

Method: Introduce TASE, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and reason about token-level information across languages, and train a custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method.

Result: Human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent weaknesses in token-level reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs still have limitations in token-level reasoning compared to human performance.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/cyzcz/Tase .

TL;DR: 研究分析了现有创造力评估指标的局限性，并强调需要更可靠的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在评估各种创造力评估指标在不同创造性领域的有效性。

Method: 系统地检查、分析和比较了具有代表性的创造力指标，包括创造力指数、困惑度、句法模板和LLM-as-a-Judge。

Result: 这些指标表现出有限的一致性，捕捉了创造力的不同维度。同时指出了关键的局限性，包括创造力指数、困惑度、句法模板和LLM-as-a-Judge等。

Conclusion: 现有创造力评估指标在不同创造性领域表现出有限的一致性，并且存在诸如创造力指数侧重于词汇多样性、困惑度对模型置信度敏感、句法模板无法捕捉概念性创造力以及LLM-as-a-Judge不稳定和偏见等局限性。需要更强大、更通用的评估框架，以更好地与人类对创造力的判断保持一致。

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Su Dong,Shengyuan Chen,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAG是一种新的范例，它通过系统的 क्वेश्चन分解和依赖感知推理来重构知识增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在各种任务中表现出了卓越的能力，但在知识密集型任务中表现出关键的局限性，在面对需要专业知识的问题时经常产生幻觉。虽然检索增强生成（RAG）通过整合外部知识来缓解这种情况，但由于其依赖于直接语义检索和缺乏结构化的逻辑组织，因此在复杂的推理场景中步履蹒跚。

Method: LAG首先将复杂问题分解为按逻辑依赖性排序的原子子问题。然后，它依次解决这些问题，使用先前的答案来指导后续子问题的上下文检索，确保逐步扎根于逻辑链中。为了防止错误传播，LAG包含一个逻辑终止机制，该机制在遇到无法回答的子问题时停止推理，并减少在过度推理上浪费的计算。最后，它综合所有子解决方案以生成经过验证的响应。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，LAG显著增强了推理的稳健性，减少了幻觉，并将LLM问题解决与人类认知对齐。

Conclusion: LAG显著增强了推理的稳健性，减少了幻觉，并将LLM问题解决与人类认知对齐，为现有的RAG系统提供了一个有原则的替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了大型语言模型在地理区域推断方面存在偏差，全球北方和全球西方实体的推断成功率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）已经被广泛调整以减轻明显的偏见，但它们仍然表现出微妙的隐性偏见，这些偏见根植于它们的预训练数据中。我们没有直接用可能触发安全措施的人工问题来探测LLM，而是提出研究模型在主动提问时的行为方式。

Method: 使用一个新的数据集Geo20Q+，该数据集包含来自不同地区的著名人物和具有文化意义的物体（例如，食物、地标、动物），系统地评估实体推演中的地理性能差异。在两种游戏配置（标准的20个问题和无限制的回合）和七种语言（英语、印地语、普通话、日语、法语、西班牙语和土耳其语）中测试流行的LLM。

Result: 结果表明，LLM在推断全球北方实体方面比全球南方实体更成功，在全球西方实体方面比全球东方实体更成功。虽然维基百科的页面浏览量和预训练语料库的频率与性能有轻微的相关性，但它们未能完全解释这些差异。值得注意的是，玩游戏的语言对性能差距的影响很小。

Conclusion: 通过分析模型在多轮推理中发起和追求推理目标的方式，我们发现了嵌入在模型推理过程中的地域和文化差异。该研究证明了创造性的自由形式评估框架的价值，它可以揭示LLM中隐藏在标准提示设置中的微妙偏差。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoCoLex是一种新的解码策略，通过鼓励基于模型置信度的直接复制，确保对源的更高保真度，从而提高法律文本生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）虽然能够处理长而复杂的上下文，但由于它们容易产生不忠实、无根据或虚假的输出，因此在法律领域的应用受到了阻碍。检索增强生成（RAG）通过将生成内容建立在外部知识的基础上提供了一个有希望的解决方案，但它不能保证所提供的上下文将被有效地整合。上下文感知解码策略被提出来放大相关上下文的影响，但它们通常没有明确地强制对上下文的忠实性。

Method: 引入了一种名为Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text Generation (CoCoLex) 的解码策略，该策略动态地将模型生成的词汇分布与基于从上下文中复制得出的分布进行插值。

Result: CoCoLex优于现有的上下文感知解码方法，特别是在长文本生成任务中。

Conclusion: CoCoLex在五个法律基准测试中优于现有的上下文感知解码方法，特别是在长文本生成任务中。

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

*Guang Yang,Xinyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a frequency-based uncertainty quantification method for LLMs in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) to improve reliability and trustworthiness, especially in high-risk domains. It uses conformal prediction and demonstrates that sampling frequency can effectively replace logit-based probabilities in black-box scenarios, achieving better performance in distinguishing correct and incorrect predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have inherent unreliability, such as hallucination and overconfidence, which limits their application in high-risk domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty quantification method.

Method: We propose a frequency-based uncertainty quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy (PE).

Result: Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA, MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in black-box scenarios.

Conclusion: This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多语言大型语言模型在西方语言中政治观点可以跨语言传递，但跨文化差异是否会转化为跨语言差异尚不清楚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众舆论调查显示，社会文化背景下的政治观点存在跨文化差异。然而，目前尚不清楚这些差异是否会转化为多语言大型语言模型 (MLLM) 中的跨语言差异。

Method: 通过提示多语言大型语言模型报告他们对投票建议应用程序中政治声明的（不）同意程度来评估他们的观点。为了更好地理解模型中语言之间的交互，我们在仅使用直接偏好优化和英语对齐数据将它们与更多左翼或右翼观点对齐之前和之后对它们进行评估。

Result: 未对齐的模型在他们反映的政治观点中仅显示出非常少的显着跨语言差异。政治统一性几乎在所有五种语言中统一地改变了观点。

Conclusion: 政治观点在西方语言环境中可以跨语言传递，这表明在实现多语言大型语言模型的显式社会语言、文化和政治统一性方面存在挑战。

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

TL;DR: MathSmith是一个新的框架，用于合成具有挑战性的数学问题，以增强LLM推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成方法主要依靠转换人工编写的模板，限制了多样性和可扩展性。为了解决大语言模型在数学推理方面的发展受到高质量、高难度训练数据稀缺的限制的问题。

Method: MathSmith通过从PlanetMath随机抽样概念-解释对从头开始构建新问题，并采用强化学习来联合优化结构有效性、推理复杂性和答案一致性。

Result: 在五个基准测试（GSM8K、MATH-500、AIME2024、AIME2025、OlympiadBench）上的实验表明，在短CoT和长CoT设置下，MathSmith始终优于现有的基线。

Conclusion: MathSmith展示了强大的可扩展性、泛化性和迁移性，突出了高难度合成数据在提高LLM推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cooper, a reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes policy and reward models to address the limitations of existing reward paradigms. It alleviates reward hacking and improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based rewards lack robustness, while model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues

Method: We propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample pairs for continued training the reward model. We also propose a reference-based reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM

Result: Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct

Conclusion: Dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking, providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型擅长抽象推理，但它们在具身智能体推理方面的能力在很大程度上仍未得到探索。我们提出了 OmniEAR，这是一个综合框架，用于评估语言模型如何在具身任务中推理物理交互、工具使用和多智能体协作。

Method: 基于文本的环境表示，我们对跨越家庭和工业领域的 1,500 个场景中的连续物理属性和复杂空间关系进行建模。

Result: 当模型必须根据约束进行推理时，性能会严重下降：在明确的指令下达到 85-96% 的成功率，而工具推理的性能下降到 56-85%，隐式协作的性能下降到 63-85%，复合任务的失败率超过 50%。令人惊讶的是，完整的环境信息会降低协调性能，表明模型无法过滤与任务相关的约束。微调可以显着提高单智能体任务的性能（0.6% 到 76.3%），但多智能体增益最小（1.5% 到 5.5%），暴露了基本的架构限制。

Conclusion: 具身推理对当前模型提出了根本不同的挑战，OmniEAR 是评估和推进具身 AI 系统的严格基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Motivation: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification methods.

Method: a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning

Result: Evaluated on six long-form factuality benchmarks, the factual reasoning model achieves an average reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

Conclusion: The factual reasoning model achieves an average reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in

*Brandon Jaipersaud,David Krueger,Ekdeep Singh Lubana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Probes are used to study persuasion dynamics in conversations.  Probes can identify persuasion success and strategy, and outperform prompting in some settings. Probes are a plausible avenue for studying complex behaviors in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: understanding of how this dynamic transpires is limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to study

Method: apply probes to study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. leverage insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.

Result: probes can capture various aspects of persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. probes can identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such as when uncovering persuasion strategy.

Conclusion: Probes are a plausible avenue for studying complex behaviors such as deception and manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words span many bytes

Conclusion: hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

### [42] [RetinexDual: Retinex-based Dual Nature Approach for Generalized Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04797)
*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual是一个新的基于Retinex理论的框架，用于广义UHD IR任务，它优于最新的技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法，如下采样或从空间域到频域的转换，存在显着的缺点：下采样会导致UHD图像中不可逆的信息丢失，而我们的频率分析表明，纯频域方法对于空间受限的图像伪影无效，这主要是由于退化局部性的丧失。

Method: RetinexDual，一个基于Retinex理论的新框架，专为广义UHD IR任务而设计。RetinexDual利用两个互补的子网络：Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA)和Frequency Illumination Adaptor (FIA)。

Result: RetinexDual在四个UHD IR任务上优于最近的方法，并且消融研究证明了RetinexDual中每个分支采用不同设计的重要性及其各种组件的有效性。

Conclusion: RetinexDual在四个UHD IR任务（即去雨、去模糊、去雾和低光图像增强）上优于最近的方法，并且消融研究证明了RetinexDual中每个分支采用不同设计的重要性及其各种组件的有效性。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

TL;DR: Introduces ENTRep, a new benchmark dataset for ENT endoscopy analysis with tasks for classification and retrieval, and reports initial results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery in ENT care is underdeveloped due to variability in devices/operators, subtle findings, and fine-grained distinctions. Clinicians need reliable retrieval of similar cases, which is rarely supported by existing benchmarks.

Method: The paper introduces a dataset with expert-annotated images labeled for anatomical region and status, accompanied by dual-language descriptions. It defines three benchmark tasks and standardizes the submission protocol.

Result: The paper reports results from the top-performing teams.

Conclusion: The paper introduces ENTRep, a new benchmark dataset for ENT endoscopy analysis, and evaluates the performance of top-performing teams on three benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMAD distills knowledge from multiple self-supervised ViTs into a compact model, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning paradigms are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.

Method: Consensus-oriented Masked Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision Transformers into a compact student network using asymmetric masking, linear adapter, layer normalization, and joint consensus gating.

Result: CoMAD achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, and MS-COCO with a compact ViT-Tiny model.

Conclusion: CoMAD's ViT-Tiny achieves 75.4 percent Top-1 on ImageNet-1K, 47.3 percent mIoU on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL distillation.

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RADAR: Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based diffusion models in Real-time, overcomes the limitations of reconstruction-based anomaly detection, improving both detection accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1) the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in unsupervised settings.

Method: RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational efficiency.

Result: RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best model.

Conclusion: RADAR surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best model.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: accurately tracking eye movements during specific events. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device comfort and enhancing overall user experience.

Method: explored various approaches, with the CNN_LSTM model

Result: achieving approximately 81% accuracy

Conclusion: The CNN_LSTM model was most effective, achieving approximately 81% accuracy. Future work focuses on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the model's interpretability and predictive performance.

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the

TL;DR: LuKAN is an efficient 3D human motion prediction model using KANs with Lucas polynomials, achieving competitive performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often face limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in 3D human motion prediction.

Method: The LuKAN model uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations. It applies discrete wavelet transform, spatial projection, and inverse discrete wavelet transform.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of the LuKAN model.

Conclusion: The LuKAN model achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets with computational efficiency.

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VER-Bench是一个新的基准，用于评估MLLM识别细粒度视觉线索并将其与世界知识相结合以进行复杂推理的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的基准主要分为两种类型：基本感知基准，侧重于局部细节，但缺乏深入的推理（例如，“图像中有什么？”）；以及主流推理基准，侧重于突出的图像元素，但可能无法评估需要复杂分析的微妙线索。然而，深刻的视觉理解和复杂的推理更多地依赖于解释微妙的、不显眼的局部细节，而不是感知显著的、宏观层面的对象。

Method: 引入了VER-Bench，这是一个新的框架，用于评估MLLM的能力：1）识别细粒度的视觉线索，通常平均仅占图像面积的0.25%；2）将这些线索与世界知识相结合，进行复杂的推理。

Result: VER-Bench包含374个精心设计的问题，涵盖地理空间、时间、情境、意图、系统状态和符号推理，每个问题都附有结构化的证据：视觉线索和从中推导出的与问题相关的推理。

Conclusion: VER-Bench揭示了当前模型在提取微妙的视觉证据和构建基于证据的论证方面的局限性，强调需要提高模型在细粒度视觉证据提取、整合和推理方面的能力，以实现真正的视觉理解和类人分析。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of label ambiguity in multimodal hateful video detection through a fine-grained approach, finding that time-stamp noise alters model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence. It highlights the need for temporally aware models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal granularity of hateful content, which introduces substantial label noise.

Method: Trimmed hateful videos from the HateMM and MultiHateClip datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate hateful segments and conducted an exploratory analysis of these trimmed segments.

Result: The analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations.

Conclusion: Timestamp noise alters model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting the context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech. The study provides insights into the temporal dynamics of multimodal hateful videos and highlights the need for temporally aware models.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

TL;DR: Highlight-TTA 是一种测试时自适应框架，用于视频高光检测，它通过动态调整模型以更好地与每个测试视频的特定特征对齐来提高泛化能力和高光检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频高光检测方法虽然先进，但难以很好地推广到所有测试视频。这些方法通常为每个测试视频采用通用高光检测模型，这是次优的，因为它无法解释各个测试视频的独特特征和变化。这种固定模型无法适应新的、未见过的测试视频中存在的多样化内容、风格或音频和视觉质量，从而导致高光检测性能下降。

Method: 我们提出了 Highlight-TTA，这是一个用于视频高光检测的测试时自适应框架，该框架通过在测试期间动态调整模型以更好地与每个测试视频的特定特征对齐来解决此限制，从而提高泛化和高光检测性能。Highlight-TTA 与辅助任务（跨模态幻觉）以及主要高光检测任务共同优化。我们利用元辅助训练方案，通过辅助任务实现有效适应，同时增强主要任务。在测试期间，我们使用测试视频上的辅助任务来调整训练后的模型，以进一步提高其高光检测性能。

Result: 通过三个最先进的高光检测模型和三个基准数据集进行的大量实验表明，将 Highlight-TTA 引入这些模型可以提高它们的性能，从而产生优异的结果。

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA 提升了现有高光检测模型的性能，并在三个基准数据集上取得了优异的结果。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a self-supervised method to adapt monocular depth estimators trained on perspective images to fisheye images by aligning the latent embeddings and using calibration tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs) are susceptible to the covariate shift introduced by changes in camera calibration parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates.

Method: The method aligns the distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of perspective images by introducing Calibration Tokens as a light-weight adaptation mechanism.

Result: The approach consistently improves over state-of-the-art methods on both indoors and outdoors using a single set of tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves the performance of foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs) on fisheye images.

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

TL;DR: ProMIM is a plug-and-play framework that improves the generalization performance of VLMs by using masked image modeling to generate robust prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning techniques overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories.

Method: ProMIM enhances conditional prompt learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM pipelines. It leverages a masking strategy to generate robust, instance-conditioned prompts.

Result: ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting with negligible additional computational cost.

Conclusion: ProMIM consistently boosts generalization performance in zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRKT是一种用于弱监督动态场景图生成（WS-DSGG）的方法，它通过利用关系和运动感知知识来增强对象检测，从而在Action Genome数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的WS-DSGG方法依赖于现成的外部对象检测器来为后续DSGG训练生成伪标签。然而，在静态的、以对象为中心的图像上训练的检测器在DSGG所需的动态的、关系感知的场景中表现不佳，导致不准确的定位和低置信度的提议。为了解决外部对象检测器在WS-DSGG中带来的挑战。

Method: Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)方法，它利用知识来增强关系感知动态场景中的检测。TRKT建立在两个关键组件之上：（1）关系感知知识挖掘：首先，我们采用对象和关系类解码器来生成类别特定的注意力图，以突出对象区域和交互区域。然后，我们提出了一种帧间注意力增强策略，该策略利用相邻帧的光流来增强注意力图，使其具有运动感知能力并且对运动模糊具有鲁棒性。此步骤产生了用于WS-DSGG的关系和运动感知知识挖掘。（2）我们引入了一个双流融合模块，该模块将类别特定的注意力图集成到外部检测中，以完善对象定位并提高对象提议的置信度。

Result: TRKT在Action Genome数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRKT在Action Genome数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

Motivation: the robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift remains uncertain, posing an especially critical challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological signals

Method: a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning

Result: AdvDINO mitigates slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful representations. Across $>5.46$ million mIF image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction

Conclusion: AdvDINO mitigates slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful representations than non-adversarial baselines. the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in attention-based multiple instance learning

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

*Peng Zhang,Songru Yang,Jinsheng Sun,Weiqing Li,Zhiyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOW-Seg 是一种人机交互框架，用于开放世界点云语义分割，它利用稀疏的人工注释和分层原型消歧机制，实现了高性能的分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放世界点云语义分割（OW-Seg）方法依赖于资源密集型的离线增量学习或密集注释的支持数据，限制了它们的实用性。

Method: 我们提出了 HOW-Seg，这是第一个用于 OW-Seg 的人机交互框架。我们直接在查询数据上构建类原型，即基本分割单元，避免了支持数据和查询数据之间类内分布偏移导致的原型偏差。通过利用稀疏的人工注释作为指导，HOW-Seg 能够为基类和新类进行基于原型的分割。考虑到初始原型的粒度不足，我们引入了一种分层原型消歧机制来细化对应于不同类注释的模糊原型。为了进一步丰富上下文感知，我们在细化的原型上采用密集条件随机场（CRF）来优化它们的标签分配。

Result: 通过稀疏注释（例如，one-novel-class-one-click），HOW-Seg 在 5-shot 设置下匹配或超过了最先进的广义少样本分割（GFS-Seg）方法。当使用高级骨干网络（例如，Stratified Transformer）和更密集的注释（例如，每个子场景 10 次点击）时，HOW-Seg 在 S3DIS 上实现了 85.27% 的 mIoU，在 ScanNetv2 上实现了 66.37% 的 mIoU，显著优于其他替代方案。

Conclusion: HOW-Seg 通过迭代式的人工反馈动态地改进其预测，从而为基类和新类实现高质量的分割。实验表明，通过稀疏注释（例如，one-novel-class-one-click），HOW-Seg 在 5-shot 设置下匹配或超过了最先进的广义少样本分割（GFS-Seg）方法。当使用高级骨干网络（例如，Stratified Transformer）和更密集的注释（例如，每个子场景 10 次点击）时，HOW-Seg 在 S3DIS 上实现了 85.27% 的 mIoU，在 ScanNetv2 上实现了 66.37% 的 mIoU，显著优于其他替代方案。

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的3D Gaussian Splatting方法，通过自适应加权和不确定性学习，提高了在稀疏视图场景下的渲染质量和重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数3DGS方法中，Gaussians在渲染过程中被同等加权，这使得它们容易过拟合，尤其是在稀疏视图场景中。

Method: 通过学习的不确定性来表征Gaussian的自适应加权如何影响渲染质量。

Result: 该方法优于稀疏视图3D合成中的其他方法，并在大多数数据集中以更少的Gaussian实现了更高质量的重建。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视图3D合成中优于其他方法，与现有的稀疏视图方法相比，在大多数数据集中以更少的Gaussian实现了更高质量的重建，例如，与DropGaussian相比，该方法在MipNeRF 360数据集上实现了3.27%的PSNR改进。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

TL;DR: This paper improves canvas-based attention scheduling by allowing for variable-size canvas frames and employing selectable canvas frame rates, which improves the attainable quality/cost trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area, called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate.

Method: This paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i) allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset.

Result: Our results show that the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision (mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的图像压缩具有令人印象深刻的感知性能。但是，它有两个关键缺点：（1）由于多步采样而导致的过度解码延迟，以及（2）由于过度依赖生成先验而导致的保真度差。

Method: 利用预训练的基于VAE的模型生成具有丰富信息的潜在变量，并用单步解码代替迭代去噪过程。引入保真度指导模块，鼓励输出忠实于原始图像。设计了速率退火训练策略，以在极低的比特率下实现有效的训练。

Conclusion: SODEC在速率-失真-感知性能方面显著优于现有方法，并且解码速度比以前基于扩散的压缩模型提高了20倍以上。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

TL;DR: This paper proposes a depth completion framework that leverages depth foundation models and a dual-space propagation approach to achieve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion models is a promising solution.

Method: A novel depth completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to extract environmental cues from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth information into missing regions. A dual-space propagation approach, without any learnable parameters, effectively propagates sparse depth in both 3D and 2D spaces. A learnable correction module progressively adjusts the depth prediction towards the real depth.

Result: The framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods on 16 datasets. Models are released in https://github.com/shenglunch/PSD.

Conclusion: The proposed depth completion framework performs remarkably well in out-of-distribution scenarios and outperforms existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods.

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct UDA with VLMs suffers from suboptimal performance due to the modality gap, where only modality-invariant knowledge is transferred.

Method: A unified modality separation framework with modality-adaptive ensemble weights and a modality discrepancy metric.

Result: Up to 9% performance gain with 9 times computational efficiencies compared to existing methods. Demonstrated efficacy across various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings.

Conclusion: The proposed modality separation framework improves UDA performance by disentangling and handling modality-specific and modality-invariant components, achieving significant performance gains and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

Conclusion: 熟悉性训练将全局敏感性引入到分层网络的早期层中，并且混合的快慢权重架构可以为研究大脑中的快速全局上下文学习提供可行的计算模型。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

Conclusion: AG-ReID在多个Re-ID数据集上实现了最先进的结果，在处理遮挡和细微属性差异方面表现出显着改进，同时在标准Re-ID场景中保持了竞争性能。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

*Shivani Mall,Joao F. Henriques*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CRAM, a video continual learning method that uses compressed video and code refreshing to reduce memory footprint and improve performance on large-scale video datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical video CL is challenging due to the high memory requirements of video, which are exacerbated by long videos and continual streams, conflicting with rehearsal-buffer size constraints.

Method: The paper proposes CRAM, a rehearsal-based video CL method that uses compressed vision (video codes) and a scheme to refresh video codes to mitigate catastrophic forgetting of the video compressor.

Result: The paper expands current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings (EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700), storing thousands of relatively long videos in under 2 GB.

Conclusion: The proposed CRAM method outperforms prior video CL methods with a significantly reduced memory footprint, demonstrated on large-scale video CL benchmarks.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的高变异性和复杂性导致 VLM 在医学成像应用中面临挑战。医学图像通常表现出由各种混淆因素引起的显著域偏移，导致模型在应用于未见过的域时泛化能力较差。

Method: 多模态因果驱动表征学习 (MCDRL)，集成了因果推理与 VLM，解决医学图像分割中的域泛化问题。它通过 CLIP 识别病灶区域，构建混淆因素字典，并训练因果干预网络消除域特异性变异的影响。

Result: MCDRL 持续优于其他方法，产生卓越的分割精度并表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCDRL在分割精度和泛化能力上优于其他方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Motivation: 缺乏专门的质量评估模型已成为一个重要的限制因素，限制了用户体验并阻碍了增强方法的进步。感知质量评估方法在 UGC 和 AIGC 上表现出强大的性能，但它们在 AI 增强的 UGC (AI-UGC) 上的有效性在很大程度上仍未被探索。

Method: 构建了一个包含 4,800 个 AI-UGC 图像的基准数据集 AU-IQA，这些图像由三种具有代表性的增强类型（包括超分辨率、弱光增强和去噪）生成。对该数据集上的一系列现有质量评估模型进行了评估，包括传统 IQA 方法和大型多模态模型。

Conclusion: 分析表明，现有方法在评估 AI-UGC 的感知质量方面表现不佳。

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

TL;DR: skin-SOAP: A weakly supervised multimodal framework generates clinical SOAP notes from limited inputs, reducing clinician burden and achieving comparable performance to large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis and treatment of skin carcinoma are critical, but manual generation of SOAP notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.

Method: The paper proposes a weakly supervised multimodal framework (skin-SOAP) to generate SOAP notes from lesion images and sparse clinical text.

Result: skin-SOAP achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro. The paper also introduces two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS).

Conclusion: The paper introduces skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework for generating clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs. It achieves performance comparable to strong baselines and introduces new metrics for clinical relevance.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

*Md Redwanul Haque,Manzur Murshed,Manoranjan Paul,Tsz-Kwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SCSSIM, a new metric for evaluating image quality by assessing Scene Composition Structure (SCS) preservation, which overcomes the limitations of traditional methods and neural-network-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal, neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential generalization issues.

Method: a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural relationships

Result: SCSSIM's high invariance to non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely, it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation

Conclusion: SCSSIM is a valuable tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of scene composition.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework, HAMoBE, for video-based person ReID that adaptively integrates appearance, body shape, and gait features, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery pair for effective matching.

Method: A novel Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework is proposed, leveraging multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g., CLIP) and a dual-input decision gating network.

Result: The approach yields significant performance improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy) on benchmarks like MEVID.

Conclusion: The proposed HAMoBE framework achieves significant performance improvements on video-based ReID benchmarks like MEVID (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Method: propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention

Result: reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach

Conclusion: Spot-IT achieves significant improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise detail extraction from complex layouts.

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

Conclusion: DualMat在Objaverse和真实世界数据上实现了最先进的性能，在反照率估计方面提高了28%，在金属粗糙度预测误差方面降低了39%。

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: the colorization problem is challenging as it is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the surface texture could provide important cues for colors

Method: classification and adversarial learning

Result: N/A

Conclusion: explore automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific scenario and make comparisons.

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN-based and diffusion-based makeup transfer approaches have limitations in balancing transfer quality and facial identity consistency, often relying on auxiliary components that introduce extra errors.

Method: The method leverages source-reference image pairs, builds upon FLUX-Kontext using the source image as conditional input, and introduces RefLoRAInjector for makeup feature extraction. A data generation pipeline provides accurate supervision during training.

Result: FLUX-Makeup achieves high-fidelity, identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer without needing auxiliary face-control components.

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: AdaFusion 能够弥合异构 PFM，从而提高性能和模型特定归纳偏差的可解释性。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

Conclusion: PoseGen在身份保真度、姿势准确性方面明显优于现有方法，并且能够生成无限时长的连贯、无伪影的视频。

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance degradation in class-incremental learning. Existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.

Method: a novel FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task learning, and a Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision boundaries

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200 demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL

Conclusion: SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉基础框架，该框架利用从单个文本输入生成的多个潜在表达式，通过结合原始描述中没有的互补视觉细节, 从而在多个基准测试中优于最先进的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于单个文本输入，该输入仅捕获视觉域中可用的大量信息的一小部分。丰富的视觉细节和稀疏的文本线索之间的这种不匹配可能导致相似对象的错误识别。

Method: 提出了一种新的视觉基础框架，该框架利用从单个文本输入生成的多个潜在表达式，通过结合原始描述中没有的互补视觉细节。具体来说，引入了主题分配器和视觉概念注入器模块，以将共享主题和不同属性概念嵌入到潜在表示中，从而捕获独特的和特定于目标的视觉线索。还提出了一种正边距对比学习策略，以将所有潜在表达式与原始文本对齐，同时保留细微的变化。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中优于最先进的 RIS 和 REC 方法，并且在广义指代表达式分割 (GRES) 基准测试中实现了出色的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个基准测试中优于最先进的 RIS 和 REC 方法，并且在广义指代表达式分割 (GRES) 基准测试中实现了出色的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

TL;DR: FedGIN是一种用于多模态器官分割的联邦学习(FL)框架，无需共享原始患者数据， 并在数据有限的情况下实现了强大的跨模态泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI辅助诊断、手术计划和治疗监测中，医学图像分割起着关键作用。需要一个能够有效推广到多种模态的统一模型。然而，实际部署面临数据稀缺、模态间域转移以及阻止数据共享的隐私限制等主要挑战。

Method: 联邦学习(FL)框架，集成了轻量级的全局强度非线性(GIN)增强模块，用于协调模态特异性强度分布。

Result: 在有限数据集的情况下，与没有GIN的FL相比，FedGIN在MRI测试用例上的3D Dice评分提高了12%至18%，并且始终优于局部基线。在完整数据集的情况下，FedGIN表现出接近中心化的性能，与仅MRI基线相比，Dice评分提高了30%，与仅CT基线相比，Dice评分提高了10%。

Conclusion: FedGIN在保护隐私的情况下实现了强大的跨模态泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种自动发现与慢性疼痛相关特征的框架，无需依赖人类定义的动作标签，并在疼痛分类和药物疗效评估方面优于人类专家和其他方法。


<details>

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a rotation equivariant ASISR method to address the issue of warped and deformed geometric patterns in low-resolution images, achieving improved performance and the ability to enhance existing ASISR methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedding rotation equivariance into the ASISR network is necessary to maintain the original orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the input image, which are often warped and deformed in low-resolution images.

Method: The method elaborately redesigns the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic rotation equivariance capabilities.

Result: The ASISR network can be implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to output. Theoretical analysis evaluates its intrinsic equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an equivariance structure.

Conclusion: The proposed rotation equivariant ASISR method demonstrates superior performance on both simulated and real datasets. It can also be integrated into current ASISR methods to further enhance their performance.

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

TL;DR: X-MoGen是第一个统一的跨物种文本驱动运动生成框架，涵盖人类和动物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常分别对人类和动物的运动进行建模，而联合跨物种方法具有关键优势，例如统一的表示和改进的泛化。然而，物种之间的形态差异仍然是一个关键挑战，通常会损害运动的合理性。

Method: X-MoGen 采用两阶段架构。首先，条件图变分自动编码器学习规范的 T 姿势先验，而自动编码器将运动编码到由形态损失正则化的共享潜在空间中。在第二阶段，我们执行掩码运动建模，以生成以文本描述为条件的运动嵌入。

Result: 我们构建了 UniMo4D，这是一个包含 115 个物种和 119k 个运动序列的大规模数据集，它在共享骨骼拓扑下整合了人类和动物运动，用于联合训练。

Conclusion: X-MoGen在UniMo4D数据集上的大量实验表明，在已见和未见物种上，其性能优于目前最先进的方法。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

TL;DR: PhysPatch是一种为基于MLLM的AD系统量身定制的、物理上可实现且可转移的对抗性补丁框架，它优于现有的攻击方法，并在现实世界中具有很强的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于补丁的攻击方法主要是为目标检测模型设计的，当转移到基于MLLM的系统时，由于后者复杂的架构和推理能力，表现不佳。MLLM容易受到对抗性攻击，特别是对抗性补丁攻击，这可能在现实场景中构成严重威胁。

Method: PhysPatch联合优化补丁位置、形状和内容，以提高攻击有效性和真实世界的适用性。它引入了一种基于语义的掩码初始化策略，用于真实放置；一种基于SVD的局部对齐损失与补丁引导的裁剪调整大小，以提高可迁移性；以及一种基于势场的掩码细化方法。

Result: 在开源、商业和具有推理能力的MLLM上进行的大量实验表明，PhysPatch显著优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: PhysPatch在将基于MLLM的AD系统转向目标对齐的感知和规划输出方面，显著优于先前的方法。此外，PhysPatch始终将对抗性补丁放置在AD场景中物理上可行的区域，确保了强大的真实世界适用性和可部署性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Motivation: 光谱信息长期以来被认为是遥感观测中的关键线索。虽然已经开发了许多用于像素级解释的视觉语言模型，但光谱信息仍然未得到充分利用，导致性能欠佳，尤其是在多光谱场景中。

Method: SPEX，一种多模态LLM，专为指令驱动的土地覆盖提取而设计。为此，我们引入了几个精心设计的组件和训练策略，包括多尺度特征聚合、token上下文浓缩和多光谱视觉预训练，以实现精确和灵活的像素级解释。

Conclusion: SPEX在提取植被、建筑物和水体等典型地物覆盖类别方面，始终优于现有的最先进方法。此外，SPEX 能够为其预测生成文本解释，从而提高可解释性和用户友好性。

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

TL;DR: EndoMatcher, a generalizable endoscopic image matcher, addresses challenges in endoscopic image matching using a Vision Transformer, a multi-domain dataset (Endo-Mix6), and a progressive training strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for robot-assisted tasks but challenged by difficult visual conditions and data scarcity.

Method: EndoMatcher uses a two-branch Vision Transformer with dual interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning and is trained on the Endo-Mix6 dataset using a progressive multi-objective training strategy.

Result: EndoMatcher improves inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder datasets, respectively, and improves MDPA by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset.

Conclusion: EndoMatcher generalizes well to unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot manner, achieving significant improvements in inlier matches and matching direction prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

TL;DR: VFlowOpt 是一种 token 剪枝框架，它可以修剪 90% 的视觉 token，同时保持相当的性能，从而使 KV-Cache 内存减少 89%，推理速度提高 3.8 倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型 (LMM) 通过利用大量视觉 token 来获得精细的视觉信息，从而在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但这种 token 冗余导致了巨大的计算成本。以往旨在减少推理期间视觉 token 的研究通常利用从纯视觉 token 或视觉语言 token 之间的注意力得分导出的重要性图来跨一个或多个剪枝阶段修剪 token。尽管取得了这些进展，但剪枝框架和策略仍然过于简单且探索不足，通常会导致严重的性能下降。

Method: 提出了一种 token 剪枝框架 VFlowOpt，该框架引入了重要性图推导过程和一个具有回收机制的渐进式剪枝模块。其剪枝策略的超参数通过视觉信息流引导的方法进一步优化。

Result: VFlowOpt 可以修剪 90% 的视觉 token，同时保持相当的性能，从而使 KV-Cache 内存减少 89%，推理速度提高 3.8 倍。

Conclusion: VFlowOpt 可以在保持相当性能的同时修剪 90% 的视觉 token，从而使 KV-Cache 内存减少 89%，推理速度提高 3.8 倍。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

*Xiao Wang,Liye Jin,Xufeng Lou,Shiao Wang,Lan Chen,Bo Jiang,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes ReasoningTrack, a reasoning-based vision-language tracking framework using Qwen2.5-VL, SFT, and GRPO. It also introduces a new large-scale dataset TNLLT and demonstrates improved performance on vision-language tracking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large models, which further limits their overall performance.

Method: a novel reasoning-based vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then, we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object. In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20 baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.

Result: 20 baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural language generation strategy.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural language generation strategy.

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved challenge in numerous industrial settings. Traditional approaches assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup.

Method: fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1

Result: accurate segmentation of highly non-convex, irregular bubble structures

Conclusion: SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Arbiviewgen是一种新的基于扩散的框架，用于从任意视点生成可控的相机图像，通过FAVS和CVC-SSL解决缺乏外推视角真实数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏外推视角的真实数据，这阻碍了高保真生成模型的训练。因此，本文旨在实现任意视点图像生成。

Method: 基于扩散的框架，结合Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching (FAVS) 和 Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL)。

Result: 该框架仅需要多相机图像及其相关姿势进行训练，无需额外的传感器或深度图。

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen是第一个能够在多种车辆配置中生成可控的任意视角相机图像的方法。

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

Motivation: 工业机械维护需要及时干预，以防止灾难性故障并优化运营效率。本文介绍了一种基于大型语言模型 (LLM) 的集成智能系统，用于规范性维护，该系统超越了传统的异常检测，可提供可操作的维护建议。

Method: 该方法将轴承振动数据（BPFO、BPFI、BSF、FTF 频率）序列化为自然语言，以进行 LLM 处理，从而实现高精度的少样本异常检测。多代理组件使用向量嵌入和语义搜索处理维护手册，同时进行网络搜索以检索全面的程序知识并访问最新的维护实践，从而获得更准确和深入的建议。

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

Motivation: 对抗性棋盘游戏作为战略推理和智能的范例领域，长期以来既是一种流行的竞争活动，也是评估人工智能（AI）系统的基准。主流的基于问答（Q＆A）的基准方法存在数据依赖性的局限性，因此需要新的评估方法。

Conclusion: 尽管存在技术差异，但大多数LLM在输赢方面仍然乐观，表现出比人类更强的对高压力对抗环境的适应性。循环胜负的复杂关系暴露了LLM在游戏过程中技能表现的不稳定性，需要进一步解释和探索。

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

Motivation: Current AWebGIS solutions rely on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet access and raise privacy and scalability issues.

Method: The study compares three approaches: a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs, a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning, and a fully autonomous offline method based on a fine-tuned T5-small model executed in the client's web browser.

Result: The client-side method using SLMs achieved the highest accuracy, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of 0.99, and ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L scores of 0.98. It also reduces the load on backend servers.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using browser-executable small language models (SLMs) for Autonomous Web-based Geographical Information Systems (AWebGIS), achieving high accuracy while reducing server load and addressing privacy concerns.

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic, non-ideal scenarios.

Method: Fine-tuned three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM) using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then tested their performance on eight public datasets.

Result: RL fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Current methods leave these reasoning deficits largely unresolved.

Conclusion: RL fine-tuning improves reasoning in idealized settings but declines significantly in non-ideal scenarios, revealing limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic

HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands and proteins

Method: a novel game-theoretic framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game called the Docking Game, with a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm

Result: LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10% improvement in predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art methods

Conclusion: LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10% improvement in predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the accuracy of molecular docking in drug discovery.

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

TL;DR: LLMs can be used for spatial data integration, but they need relevant features and a review-and-refine method to correct errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases, requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples.

Method: We adapt a review-and-refine method to correct erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses.

Result: LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning, LLMs are able to generate high-performing results.

Conclusion: LLMs are a promising and flexible alternative to traditional rule-based heuristics for adaptive spatial data integration.

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web navigation is critical and challenging for AGI, demanding complex decision-making. Current approaches rarely integrate offline imitation learning and online exploration effectively.

Method: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, a decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2 cognitive processes is derived. This is implemented in CogniWeb, a modular agent architecture.

Result: CogniWeb achieves 43.96% success rate on WebArena with 75% reduction in token usage.

Conclusion: CogniWeb achieves competitive performance with higher efficiency.

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token

TL;DR: 提出了MedMKEB，这是一个用于评估医学多模态大型语言模型知识编辑的综合基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医学知识不断发展，允许这些模型有效地更新过时或不正确的信息而不从头开始重新训练至关重要。尽管文本知识编辑已被广泛研究，但仍然缺乏对涉及图像和文本模态的多模态医学知识编辑的系统基准。

Method: 我们提出了MedMKEB，这是第一个综合基准，旨在评估医学多模态大型语言模型中知识编辑的可靠性、通用性、局部性、可移植性和鲁棒性。MedMKEB建立在一个高质量的医学视觉问答数据集上，并通过精心构建的编辑任务进行了丰富，包括反事实校正、语义泛化、知识转移和对抗鲁棒性。我们结合了人类专家验证，以确保基准的准确性和可靠性。

Result: 在最先进的通用和医学MLLM上进行的大量单次编辑和顺序编辑实验证明了现有基于知识的编辑方法在医学中的局限性，突出了开发专门的编辑策略的必要性。

Conclusion: MedMKEB将作为一个标准基准，以促进可信和高效的医学知识编辑算法的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EasySize is a lightweight gate sizing framework based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model. It achieves strong performance across different technology nodes and outperforms AutoCkt with more than 96.67% of simulation resources reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: developing universal, fast, and stable gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes.

Method: a lightweight gate sizing framework based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow.

Result: achieves strong performance on 5 operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67% of tasks with more than 96.67% of simulation resources reduction.

Conclusion: EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying the analog circuit design process.

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

Motivation: Generative AI is rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated in higher education.

Method: A controlled experiment was conducted with 65 pre-service teacher students in Germany, comparing interaction with a Socratic AI Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot.

Result: Students using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical, independent, and reflective thinking.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于异构图神经网络的事件日志补全方法，可以有效地补全缺失的事件属性，并在多个数据集上取得了良好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的事件日志中，数据获取可能存在问题，导致事件记录缺少信息。传统的补全方法依赖于流程模型或机器学习/深度学习模型，但这些方法存在局限性。异构图神经网络能够更自然地表示复杂的多模态序列，提供更具表达性和语义丰富的编码。

Method: 开发了一个异构图神经网络模型，通过将执行轨迹表示为图结构，从而能够处理包含不完整事件的轨迹，并返回缺失的属性。

Result: 提出的方法在重构所有不同的事件属性方面表现出非常好的性能，优于目前最先进的无模型方法，后者主要关注于修复事件属性的子集。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种异构图神经网络模型，用于补全事件日志中缺失的事件属性，并且在不同类型的缺失值上，对合成日志和真实日志进行了评估，结果表明该方法在重构所有不同的事件属性方面表现良好。

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces QA-Dragon, a query-aware dynamic RAG system for knowledge-intensive VQA that outperforms baselines in answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores on single-source, multi-source, and multi-turn tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge.

Method: The paper proposes QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive VQA, which introduces a domain router and a search router to dynamically select optimal retrieval strategies, orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup.

Result: QA-Dragon significantly enhances the reasoning performance of base models under challenging scenarios, achieving substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task on the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025.

Conclusion: The QA-Dragon framework achieves substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Motivation: Unlike prior approaches that loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.

Result: achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On ProofWriter, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2% through logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3% accuracy gains in multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On ARC, it boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0% through integration of symbolic oracles.

Conclusion: This architecture offers a robust, interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent developments in AI capabilities have amplified ambiguity of the term agent, creating significant challenges in research communication, system evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development

Method: Drawing from historical analysis and contemporary usage patterns

Result: provides precise vocabulary for system description while preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature

Conclusion: propose a framework that defines clear minimum requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing systems along a multidimensional spectrum

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies reasoning with minimal models in Description Logics (DLs). It shows that concept satisfiability in minimal models is undecidable for $\mathcal{EL}$, but decidability can be regained by imposing acyclicity conditions on the TBox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of this problem in Description Logics (DLs). The case of `pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal, has remained largely uncharted.

Method: minimization of some selected predicates

Result: concept satisfiability in minimal models is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$

Conclusion: concept satisfiability in minimal models is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}.

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often prohibitively expensive.

Method: a novel benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and
run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported
transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast
reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without
human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from
speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the importance of considering geographic variability in AI alignment, as norms and laws differ across regions. It reviews research problems, suggests future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: the geographic variability of alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate, truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms, political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical realities

Method: reviews key geographic research problems, suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment sensitivity.

Result: some model outputs are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on knowing the user's location and their context. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about how context is managed

Conclusion: This paper reviews key geographic research problems, suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment sensitivity.

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

*Matteo Prandi,Vincenzo Suriani,Federico Pierucci,Marcello Galisai,Daniele Nardi,Piercosma Bisconti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current AI benchmarks don't adequately evaluate systemic risks as required by the EU AI Act, focusing instead on narrow behavioral propensities. Critical capabilities like evading human oversight are neglected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of GPAI models and emerging regulations like the EU AI Act necessitate robust evaluation frameworks that address systemic risks, which current benchmarks fail to adequately measure.

Method: A novel framework called Bench-2-CoP, using LLM-as-judge analysis, was used to map 194,955 benchmark questions against the EU AI Act's taxonomy.

Result: The evaluation ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on behavioral propensities like hallucination and bias, while capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios receive zero coverage, leading to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks.

Conclusion: This study provides a quantitative analysis of the gap between current AI evaluation benchmarks and the EU AI Act's requirements, revealing a significant misalignment where critical functional capabilities related to systemic risks are almost entirely neglected.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

*Burak Can Kaplan,Hugo Cesar De Castro Carneiro,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper uses a small LLM to generate ERC datasets to address data scarcity and bias issues. The generated datasets improve the performance of ERC classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data generation--remains limited.

Method: employ a small, resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with diverse properties

Result: generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC

Conclusion: ERC classifier models trained on the generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfiAlign is a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework that aligns LLMs for enhanced reasoning by integrating SFT with DPO and a data selection pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs through post-training is resource intensive. Existing methods rely on heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability.

Method: Integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and a data selection pipeline using multidimensional quality metrics.

Result: SFT model achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B using approximately 12% of the training data, with an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME 24/25 benchmarks using DPO.

Conclusion: Combining data selection with post-training is effective for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient manner.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: GRAIL 是一种用于检索增强推理的图检索增强交互学习框架，它通过整合 LLM 引导的随机探索与路径过滤，学习动态策略，在知识图谱问答任务上取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 RAG 方法主要处理非结构化数据，处理结构化知识（如知识图谱）的能力有限；当前的图检索方法难以捕捉整体图结构，同时面临精度控制挑战。

Method: GRAIL 整合了 LLM 引导的随机探索与路径过滤，建立了一个数据合成管道，并采用两阶段训练过程学习策略，动态决定每一步的最优动作。

Result: GRAIL 在三个知识图谱问答数据集上实现了平均 21.01% 的准确率提升和 22.43% 的 F1 值提升。

Conclusion: GRAIL在知识图谱问答数据集上实现了平均 21.01% 的准确率提升和 22.43% 的 F1 值提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个通用的agent评估框架，通过模拟人类评估过程，提高了评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法要么只关注最终输出，要么只适用于狭窄的领域，忽略了agent决策过程中的逐步推理。

Method: 该框架通过将任务分解为子任务并验证每个步骤来模拟类似人类的评估。

Result: 该Judge Agent在预测任务成功率方面与人类评估更一致，与基于GPT-4o的LLM-as-a-Judge基线相比，分别实现了4.76%和10.52%的更高对齐准确率。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个通用的、模块化的框架，用于评估agent的任务完成情况，并在GAIA和BigCodeBench两个基准测试中验证了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体已发展成为一个复杂的多模态环境，文本、图像和其他信号相互作用以塑造细微的含义，通常隐藏有害意图。识别这种意图仍然具有挑战性，由于跨模态矛盾、快速的文化转变和微妙的语用线索。

Method: 提出了一个多视角代理辩论框架，具有动态反射门控，用于统一的多模态有害内容检测。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，MV-Debate 明显优于强大的单模型和现有的多智能体辩论基线。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，多智能体辩论在推进安全关键在线环境中可靠的社会意图检测方面具有前景。

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

TL;DR: 本文认为主动推理（AIF）为开发能够从经验中学习而无需持续人工奖励工程的自主人工智能智能体提供了关键基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能系统在奖励设计上过度依赖人工，面临可扩展性挑战，阻碍了真正的人工智能自主性进展。即使提议的“经验时代”允许智能体从自我生成的数据中学习，仍然依赖于大量人工设计的奖励函数，有效地将瓶颈从数据管理转移到奖励管理。这突出了当代人工智能系统自主制定、适应和追求目标的不足。

Method: 用最小化自由能的内在驱动取代外部奖励信号，允许智能体通过统一的贝叶斯目标自然地平衡探索和利用。

Result: AIF 可以通过用最小化自由能的内在驱动取代外部奖励信号来弥合这一差距，允许智能体通过统一的贝叶斯目标自然地平衡探索和利用。

Conclusion: 通过将大型语言模型作为生成世界模型与 AIF 的决策框架相结合，可以创造出能够从经验中有效学习，同时与人类价值观保持一致的智能体。这为自主发展同时遵守计算和物理约束的 AI 系统提供了一条引人注目的路径。

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

Motivation: Recent approaches struggle to capture learning dynamics, track progress over time, or provide explainability.

Method: LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment

Result: Longitudinal analysis reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct learners align closely with their psychological profiles. Learners' self-concept scores evolve realistically.

Conclusion: The default profile of base LLM is a diligent but brittle Surface Learner, lacking true, generalizable understanding.

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPEAR, a language and runtime for managing prompts in LLM pipelines, making them structured, adaptive, and first-class components to improve reuse, optimization, and runtime control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems... Yet, the central element guiding this process -- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime control.

Method: describes a vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual, assisted, and automatic)

Result: SPEAR enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.

Conclusion: SPEAR enables optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse by treating prompt logic as structured data. Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

Conclusion: DASG提升了查询精度，同时保持了效率，建立了一种协作分析范例，其中系统主动参与查询制定，而不是被动地翻译用户请求。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Data-Aware Socratic Guidance (DASG), a
dialogue-based query enhancement framework that embeds \linebreak interactive
clarification as a first-class operator within database systems to resolve
ambiguity in natural language queries. DASG treats dialogue as an optimization
decision, asking clarifying questions only when the expected execution cost
reduction exceeds the interaction overhead. The system quantifies ambiguity
through linguistic fuzziness, schema grounding confidence, and projected costs
across relational and vector backends. Our algorithm selects the optimal
clarifications by combining semantic relevance, catalog-based information gain,
and potential cost reduction. We evaluate our proposed framework on three
datasets. The results show that DASG demonstrates improved query precision
while maintaining efficiency, establishing a cooperative analytics paradigm
where systems actively participate in query formulation rather than passively
translating user requests.

### [132] [Augmented Question-guided Retrieval (AQgR) of Indian Case Law with LLM, RAG, and Structured Summaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04710)
*Vishnuprabha V,Daleesha M Viswanathan,Rajesh R,Aneesh V Pillai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper uses LLMs to improve legal case retrieval by focusing on legal issues rather than just facts, achieving better accuracy than current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying relevant legal precedents remains challenging because most retrieval methods emphasize factual similarity over legal issues, and current systems often lack explanations clarifying case relevance.

Method: The approach combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with structured summaries optimized for Indian case law and leverages the Augmented Question-guided Retrieval (AQgR) framework.

Result: The experimental evaluation on a subset of the FIRE 2019 dataset yielded a Mean Average Precision (MAP) score of 0.36 and a Mean Average Recall (MAR) of 0.67, significantly surpassing the current MAP benchmark of 0.1573.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a new approach to case law retrieval using LLMs, RAG, and structured summaries, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Identifying relevant legal precedents remains challenging, as most retrieval
methods emphasize factual similarity over legal issues, and current systems
often lack explanations clarifying case relevance. This paper proposes the use
of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this gap by facilitating the
retrieval of relevant cases, generating explanations to elucidate relevance,
and identifying core legal issues all autonomously, without requiring legal
expertise. Our approach combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with
structured summaries optimized for Indian case law. Leveraging the Augmented
Question-guided Retrieval (AQgR) framework, the system generates targeted legal
questions based on factual scenarios to identify relevant case law more
effectively. The structured summaries were assessed manually by legal experts,
given the absence of a suitable structured summary dataset. Case law retrieval
was evaluated using the FIRE dataset, and explanations were reviewed by legal
experts, as explanation generation alongside case retrieval is an emerging
innovation. Experimental evaluation on a subset of the FIRE 2019 dataset
yielded promising outcomes, achieving a Mean Average Precision (MAP) score of
0.36 and a Mean Average Recall (MAR) of 0.67 across test queries, significantly
surpassing the current MAP benchmark of 0.1573. This work introduces a suite of
novel contributions to advance case law retrieval. By transitioning from
fact-based to legal-issue-based retrieval, the proposed approach delivers more
contextually relevant results that align closely with legal professionals'
needs. Integrating legal questions within the retrieval process through the
AQgR framework ensures more precise and meaningful retrieval by refining the
context of queries.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Introduces context parallelism with jagged tensor support for HSTU attention to scale up sequence dimensions, achieving a 5.3x increase in supported user interaction sequence length and a 1.55x scaling factor when combined with DDP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling sequence length is activation-heavy, necessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. Production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to represent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation challenges.

Method: Introduces context parallelism with jagged tensor support for HSTU attention.

Result: Enables a 5.3x increase in supported user interaction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55x scaling factor when combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

Conclusion: This work introduces context parallelism with jagged tensor support for HSTU attention, enabling a 5.3x increase in supported user interaction sequence length and a 1.55x scaling factor when combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

Abstract: Large-scale recommendation systems are pivotal to process an immense volume
of daily user interactions, requiring the effective modeling of high
cardinality and heterogeneous features to ensure accurate predictions. In prior
work, we introduced Hierarchical Sequential Transducers (HSTU), an
attention-based architecture for modeling high cardinality, non-stationary
streaming recommendation data, providing good scaling law in the generative
recommender framework (GR). Recent studies and experiments demonstrate that
attending to longer user history sequences yields significant metric
improvements. However, scaling sequence length is activation-heavy,
necessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. In
transformer-based LLMs, context parallelism (CP) is a commonly used technique
that distributes computation along the sequence-length dimension across
multiple GPUs, effectively reducing memory usage from attention activations. In
contrast, production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to
represent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation
challenges. In this work, we introduce context parallelism with jagged tensor
support for HSTU attention, establishing foundational capabilities for scaling
up sequence dimensions. Our approach enables a 5.3x increase in supported user
interaction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55x scaling factor when
combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

TL;DR: This paper introduces LIS, a new metric for evaluating multimodal recommendation alignment, and shows its effectiveness in real-world A/B tests on Xiaohongshu.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the alignment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for recommendation is challenging due to inaccurate static benchmarks, expensive online system evaluations, and conventional metrics lacking actionable insights.

Method: The paper proposes the Leakage Impact Score (LIS), a novel metric for multimodal recommendation that measures the upper bound of preference data rather than directly assessing MLLMs.

Result: Online A/B tests on Content Feed and Display Ads of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed production demonstrate the effectiveness of LIS, showing significant improvements in user spent time and advertiser value.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the Leakage Impact Score (LIS) metric and demonstrates its effectiveness through online A/B tests on Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed, showing improvements in user spent time and advertiser value.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a critical technique in modern
recommender systems, leveraging content representations from advanced
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To ensure these representations are
well-adapted, alignment with the recommender system is essential. However,
evaluating the alignment of MLLMs for recommendation presents significant
challenges due to three key issues: (1) static benchmarks are inaccurate
because of the dynamism in real-world applications, (2) evaluations with online
system, while accurate, are prohibitively expensive at scale, and (3)
conventional metrics fail to provide actionable insights when learned
representations underperform. To address these challenges, we propose the
Leakage Impact Score (LIS), a novel metric for multimodal recommendation.
Rather than directly assessing MLLMs, LIS efficiently measures the upper bound
of preference data. We also share practical insights on deploying MLLMs with
LIS in real-world scenarios. Online A/B tests on both Content Feed and Display
Ads of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed production demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method, showing significant improvements in user spent time and
advertiser value.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出 HorizonRec，利用双向扩散模型协调三元偏好，实现跨领域序列推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了缓解数据稀疏和兴趣漂移问题，传统方法通常通过跨领域过渡来整合来自其他领域的辅助行为。然而，现有的跨领域序列推荐 (CDSR) 方法通常遵循一种对齐然后融合的范式，该范式执行跨多个领域的表示级对齐，并将它们机械地组合以进行推荐，忽略了领域特定偏好的细粒度融合。

Method: 提出了一种双向扩散偏好的方法来抑制潜在的噪声，并强调多领域用户表示融合过程中与目标相关的兴趣。

Result: 在来自两个不同平台的四个 CDSR 数据集上进行了大量实验，证明了 HorizonRec 在细粒度的三领域偏好融合方面的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HorizonRec在细粒度的三领域偏好融合方面表现出有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Personalized sequential recommendation aims to predict appropriate items for
users based on their behavioral sequences. To alleviate data sparsity and
interest drift issues, conventional approaches typically incorporate auxiliary
behaviors from other domains via cross-domain transition. However, existing
cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) methods often follow an
align-then-fusion paradigm that performs representation-level alignment across
multiple domains and combines them mechanically for recommendation, overlooking
the fine-grained fusion of domain-specific preferences. Inspired by recent
advances in diffusion models (DMs) for distribution matching, we propose an
align-for-fusion framework for CDSR to harmonize triple preferences via
dual-oriented DMs, termed HorizonRec. Specifically, we investigate the
uncertainty injection of DMs and identify stochastic noise as a key source of
instability in existing DM-based recommenders. To address this, we introduce a
mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval strategy that leverages distributions
retrieved from users' authentic behavioral logic as semantic bridges across
domains, enabling consistent multi-domain preference modeling. Furthermore, we
propose a dual-oriented preference diffusion method to suppress potential noise
and emphasize target-relevant interests during multi-domain user representation
fusion. Extensive experiments on four CDSR datasets from two distinct platforms
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of HorizonRec in fine-grained
triple-domain preference fusion.

TL;DR: EMER, a novel end-to-end multi-objective ensemble ranking framework, improves short video recommendation and increases user engagement on Kuaishou.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of defining effective supervision for ensemble ranking in short video recommendation systems.

Method: The paper introduces a novel sample organization method and transformer-based network architecture.

Result: The EMER framework achieves a 1.39% increase in overall App Stay Time and a 0.196% increase in 7-day user Lifetime.

Conclusion: The EMER framework achieves substantial improvements in App Stay Time and user Lifetime on the Kuaishou short video platform.

Abstract: We propose a novel End-to-end Multi-objective Ensemble Ranking framework
(EMER) for the multi-objective ensemble ranking module, which is the most
critical component of the short video recommendation system. EMER enhances
personalization by replacing manually-designed heuristic formulas with an
end-to-end modeling paradigm. EMER introduces a meticulously designed loss
function to address the fundamental challenge of defining effective supervision
for ensemble ranking, where no single ground-truth signal can fully capture
user satisfaction. Moreover, EMER introduces novel sample organization method
and transformer-based network architecture to capture the comparative
relationships among candidates, which are critical for effective ranking.
Additionally, we have proposed an offline-online consistent evaluation system
to enhance the efficiency of offline model optimization, which is an
established yet persistent challenge within the multi-objective ranking domain
in industry. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a real industrial
dataset, and the results well demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
framework. In addition, our framework has been deployed in the primary
scenarios of Kuaishou, a short video recommendation platform with hundreds of
millions of daily active users, achieving a 1.39% increase in overall App Stay
Time and a 0.196% increase in 7-day user Lifetime(LT7), which are substantial
improvements.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PaperEval是一种基于LLM的新框架，用于自动化论文评估，它使用领域感知检索和潜在推理来提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学术出版物的快速和持续增长，识别高质量的研究已成为一个日益紧迫的挑战。虽然最近利用大型语言模型（LLM）进行自动论文评估的方法显示出了巨大的希望，但它们通常受到过时的领域知识和有限的推理能力的限制。

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM的自动化论文评估框架PaperEval，该框架通过以下两个关键组件解决了这些限制：1) 领域感知论文检索模块，该模块检索相关的并发工作，以支持对新颖性和贡献的背景化评估；2) 潜在的推理机制，能够深入理解复杂的动机和方法，以及与并发相关工作的全面比较，以支持更准确和可靠的评估。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，PaperEval在学术影响和论文质量评估方面始终优于现有方法。此外，我们将PaperEval部署在真实的论文推荐系统中，用于过滤高质量的论文，并在社交媒体上获得了广泛的参与——吸引了超过8,000名订阅者，并为许多过滤后的高质量论文吸引了超过10,000次观看——证明了PaperEval的实际有效性。

Conclusion: PaperEval在学术影响和论文质量评估方面始终优于现有方法。PaperEval已部署在真实的论文推荐系统中，用于过滤高质量的论文，并在社交媒体上获得了广泛的参与。

Abstract: With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying
high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While
recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper
evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated
domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present
PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that
addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper
retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support
contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent
reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and
methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related
work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning
process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that
encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on
relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval
consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper
quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper
recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained
strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and
attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers --
demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的工具检索方法，该方法考虑了工具之间的依赖关系，并在常用数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能代理的显著进步，它们配备的工具数量正在迅速增加。然而，将所有工具信息集成到有限的模型上下文中变得不切实际，这突显了对有效工具检索方法的需求。主流方法主要依赖于工具描述和用户查询之间的语义相似性来检索相关工具。然而，它们通常独立考虑每个工具，忽略工具之间的依赖关系，这可能导致遗漏成功执行任务的前提工具。

Method: 提出工具图检索器 (TGR)，它利用工具之间的依赖关系来学习更好的工具表示以进行检索。首先，构建一个名为 TDI300K 的数据集，以训练用于识别工具依赖关系的鉴别器。然后，将所有候选工具表示为工具依赖关系图，并使用图卷积将依赖关系集成到它们的表示中。最后，这些更新的工具表示用于在线检索。

Result: 在多个常用数据集上的实验结果表明，TGR 可以提高现有主导方法的性能，实现 SOTA 性能。

Conclusion: TGR通过利用工具依赖关系，可以提高现有主导方法的性能，实现SOTA性能。深入分析验证了工具依赖关系的重要性以及TGR的有效性。

Abstract: With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped
tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the
limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient
tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on
semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve
relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently,
overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of
prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in
this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the
dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval.
First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for
identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool
dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into
their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed
for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets
show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant
methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify
the importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a sub-ID-level personalized popularity method (sPPS) within the RecJPQ framework to improve personalized novelty in music recommendations without sacrificing accuracy, addressing the limitation of item-level PPS which tends to recommend already-known content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While PPS enhances relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content, limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction.

Method: We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty.

Result: Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising recommendation accuracy.

Conclusion: The sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising recommendation accuracy.

Abstract: In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommenders have shown
promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key
characteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently
replay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research
has introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify
user-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances
relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content,
limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key
elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address
this limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially
developed to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item
decomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model
personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture
shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not
accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration
of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling
explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty.
Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by
achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising
recommendation accuracy. Code and experiments are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法存在常见的局限性——解释与模型预测的弱对齐，在识别用户意图时模糊或不准确，以及过度重复或泛化。

Method: 结合了基于SHAP的特征属性与结构化的、prompt驱动的语言生成。

Result: FIRE产生忠实的、多样化的和用户对齐的解释，这些解释基于模型的实际决策过程。结果表明，

Conclusion: FIRE不仅实现了有竞争力的推荐准确率，而且在对齐、结构和忠实度等关键维度上显著提高了说明质量。这项工作强调需要超越review-as-explanation模式，转向兼顾责任和可解释性的解释方法。

Abstract: Natural language explanations in recommender systems are often framed as a
review generation task, leveraging user reviews as ground-truth supervision.
While convenient, this approach conflates a user's opinion with the system's
reasoning, leading to explanations that may be fluent but fail to reflect the
true logic behind recommendations. In this work, we revisit the core objective
of explainable recommendation: to transparently communicate why an item is
recommended by linking user needs to relevant item features. Through a
comprehensive analysis of existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets,
we identify common limitations-explanations that are weakly aligned with model
predictions, vague or inaccurate in identifying user intents, and overly
repetitive or generic. To overcome these challenges, we propose FIRE, a
lightweight and interpretable framework that combines SHAP-based feature
attribution with structured, prompt-driven language generation. FIRE produces
faithful, diverse, and user-aligned explanations, grounded in the actual
decision-making process of the model. Our results demonstrate that FIRE not
only achieves competitive recommendation accuracy but also significantly
improves explanation quality along critical dimensions such as alignment,
structure, and faithfulness. This work highlights the need to move beyond the
review-as-explanation paradigm and toward explanation methods that are both
accountable and interpretable.

*Benedikt Kantz,Stefan Lengauer,Peter Waldert,Tobias Schreck*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A new visual query interface helps users explore and analyze knowledge graphs by showing the changes made during the query building process and allowing natural language input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual query builders help non-experts use knowledge graphs, but query building is iterative and can change, especially for explorative search.

Method: A visual querying interface communicates changes between iterative steps using graph differences and integrates a natural language interface.

Result: The system communicates changes in results by contrasting differences in result distribution and individual instances.

Conclusion: The system's applicability is demonstrated through case studies, showing it fosters data exploration and analysis of domain-specific graphs.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) contain vast amounts of linked resources that encode
knowledge in various domains, which can be queried and searched for using
specialized languages like SPARQL, a query language developed to query KGs.
Existing visual query builders enable non-expert users to construct SPARQL
queries and utilize the knowledge contained in these graphs. Query building is,
however, an iterative and, often, visual process where the question of the user
can change and differ throughout the process, especially for explorative
search. Our visual querying interface communicates these change between
iterative steps in the query building process using graph differences to
contrast the changes and the evolution in the graph query. We also enable users
to formulate their evolving information needs using a natural language
interface directly integrated into the difference query view. We, furthermore,
communicate the change in results in the result view by contrasting the
differences in both result distribution and individual instances of the
prototype graph and demonstrate the system's applicability through case studies
on different ontologies and usage scenarios, illustrating how our system
fosters, both, data exploration and analysis of domain-specific graphs.

Result: M$^3$BSR在基准数据集上显著优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: M$^3$BSR显著优于现有最佳方法。

Abstract: The sequential recommendation system utilizes historical user interactions to
predict preferences. Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns
with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential
recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper
focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation,
aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective
characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user
attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2)
the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such
as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle
modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the
accurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a
novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR).
This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a
Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep
behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data,
thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through
Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a
Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common
and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance
recommendation performance. Experimental results indicate that M$^3$BSR
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark
datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly popular for their
potential to improve performance by integrating diverse data types. However,
the actual benefits of this integration remain unclear, raising questions about

evaluate their performance on different platforms. Our findings show that
multimodal data is particularly beneficial in sparse interaction scenarios and
during the recall stage of recommendation pipelines. We also observe that the
importance of each modality is task-specific, where text features are more
useful in e-commerce and visual features are more effective in short-video
recommendations. Additionally, we explore different integration strategies and
model sizes, finding that Ensemble-Based Learning outperforms Fusion-Based
Learning, and that larger models do not necessarily deliver better results. To
deepen our understanding, we include case studies and review findings from
other recommendation domains. Our work provides practical insights for building
efficient and effective multimodal recommendation systems, emphasizing the need
for thoughtful modality selection, integration strategies, and model design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当在线测试不切实际或有风险时，离线评估在推荐系统基准测试中起着核心作用。然而，它容易受到两种关键偏差的影响：暴露偏差（用户只与他们看到的项目互动）和抽样偏差（当评估是在记录项目的子集上而不是在完整目录上执行时引入）。

Method: 使用完全观察的数据集作为ground truth，系统地模拟不同的暴露偏差，并评估常见抽样策略的可靠性。

Result: 研究结果强调了抽样何时以及如何扭曲评估结果。

Conclusion: 考察不同的日志记录和抽样选择如何影响离线评估的可靠性，并为选择产生可靠和稳健的离线比较的策略提供实用指导。

Abstract: Offline evaluation plays a central role in benchmarking recommender systems
when online testing is impractical or risky. However, it is susceptible to two
key sources of bias: exposure bias, where users only interact with items they
are shown, and sampling bias, introduced when evaluation is performed on a
subset of logged items rather than the full catalog. While prior work has
proposed methods to mitigate sampling bias, these are typically assessed on
fixed logged datasets rather than for their ability to support reliable model
comparisons under varying exposure conditions or relative to true user
preferences. In this paper, we investigate how different combinations of
logging and sampling choices affect the reliability of offline evaluation.
Using a fully observed dataset as ground truth, we systematically simulate
diverse exposure biases and assess the reliability of common sampling
strategies along four dimensions: sampling resolution (recommender model
separability), fidelity (agreement with full evaluation), robustness (stability
under exposure bias), and predictive power (alignment with ground truth). Our
findings highlight when and how sampling distorts evaluation outcomes and offer
practical guidance for selecting strategies that yield faithful and robust
offline comparisons.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and document
reranking systems remains challenging due to the lack of scalable,
user-centric, and multi-perspective evaluation tools. We introduce RankArena, a
unified platform for comparing and analysing the performance of retrieval
pipelines, rerankers, and RAG systems using structured human and LLM-based
feedback as well as for collecting such feedback. RankArena supports multiple
evaluation modes: direct reranking visualisation, blind pairwise comparisons
with human or LLM voting, supervised manual document annotation, and end-to-end
RAG answer quality assessment. It captures fine-grained relevance feedback
through both pairwise preferences and full-list annotations, along with
auxiliary metadata such as movement metrics, annotation time, and quality
ratings. The platform also integrates LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, enabling
comparison between model-generated rankings and human ground truth annotations.
All interactions are stored as structured evaluation datasets that can be used
to train rerankers, reward models, judgment agents, or retrieval strategy
selectors. Our platform is publicly available at https://rankarena.ngrok.io/,

Abstract: Live streaming platforms have become a dominant form of online content
consumption, offering dynamically evolving content, real-time interactions, and
highly engaging user experiences. These unique characteristics introduce new
challenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional

types of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich
side information features for both users and streamers. These features enable
more realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of
user and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from
multiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation

Motivation: 扩散模型(DM)已经成为高质量内容生成的强大工具，但它们对推理的密集计算需求对资源受限的边缘设备提出了挑战。基于云的解决方案有助于计算，但通常在解决多用户边缘AIGC场景中的隐私风险、个性化效率和通信成本方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了加速收敛，同时保持了在边缘约束下可扩展的多用户个性化AIGC服务的实际可行性。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC
services under edge constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSL is crucial in sciences where samples are limited and data collection is costly. The study aims to improve FSL model generalization using LMMMs.

Method: The study constructs M3FD, introduces the M3F framework, and fine-tunes the model on M3FD.

Result: M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL deployment.

Conclusion: The study introduces M3F, a novel LMMM framework, and M3FD dataset for FSL, demonstrating improved model performance and democratizing access to FSL in data-scarce scientific domains.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol, an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework, improves molecular property prediction with LLMs by eliciting relevant molecular attributes, enhancing both performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in molecular property prediction rely on human-crafted prompts and can be verbose and lack relevance.

Method: Attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework (AttriLens-Mol) using format, count, and rationality rewards to steer the model's reasoning.

Result: AttriLens-Mol significantly boosts performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, achieving comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning and advanced models. Extracted attributes also improve performance in a decision tree model.

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and performance for property prediction. Experiments show AttriLens-Mol significantly boosts performance, achieving comparable or better results than other models. Further, extracted attributes yield superior performance in a decision tree model.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in

TL;DR: PA-RNet是一种鲁棒的多模态预测框架，它通过扰动感知投影模块和跨模态注意机制来解决文本数据中的噪声问题，并在各种实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态时间序列预测方法通常忽略文本数据中的固有扰动，其中不相关、嘈杂或模棱两可的内容会显著降低模型性能，尤其是在噪声表现出不同的强度或源于结构不一致时。

Method: PA-RNet具有扰动感知投影模块和跨模态注意机制，以有效地将噪声与文本嵌入分离，同时保持语义上有意义的表示。

Result: 我们建立了PA-RNet关于文本输入的Lipschitz连续性，并证明了所提出的扰动模块可以减少预期的预测误差，为噪声条件下的稳定性提供了强有力的保证。此外，我们还引入了一个文本扰动管道，可以无缝地集成到现有的多模态时间序列预测任务中，从而可以在存在不同级别的文本噪声的情况下系统地评估模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PA-RNet在各种领域和时间设置中始终优于最先进的基线。

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

TL;DR: InfoQ is a training-free framework for mixed-precision quantization that uses mutual information to assess layer sensitivity and achieves better accuracy and search time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for mixed-precision quantization rely on expensive search algorithms or local sensitivity proxies that fail to capture the global effects of quantization error.

Method: InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each layer and measuring the change in mutual information in subsequent layers, then formulates bit-width allocation as an integer linear programming problem.

Result: InfoQ provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off and yields up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2 and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates.

Conclusion: InfoQ achieves superior search-time/accuracy trade-off and accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2 and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates.

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

TL;DR: LLMs show promise in dynamic insulin dosing but have limitations like arithmetic hallucination and temporal misinterpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: practical deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic prompts without requiring environment-specific training.

Method: evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly trained for the task.

Result: carefully designed zero-shot prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs, particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g., meals) yielded minimal performance gains

Conclusion: LLMs can achieve comparable or superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs, particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical logic.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

*Lin Jiang,Dahai Yu,Rongchao Xu,Tian Tang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an equity-aware power restoration strategy (EPOPR) to address disparities in power restoration for disadvantaged communities. EPOPR uses a predict-then-optimize framework with uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction and spatial-temporal attentional RL to improve both efficiency and equity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system restoration. Disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests, making the current restoration solution inequitable and leaving these communities vulnerable to extended power outages.

Method: predict-then-optimize framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2) Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels across regions for equitable decision-making.

Result: EPOPR reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了联邦持续推荐（FCRec）任务，并提出了一个名为F3CRec的框架，该框架优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦推荐方法难以处理非平稳数据流，而持续学习推荐方法通常假设集中式数据访问，使其与联邦学习约束不兼容。为了弥合这一差距，我们介绍了联邦持续推荐（FCRec），这是一个集成联邦推荐和持续学习推荐的新任务，要求模型在保护隐私的同时从流数据中学习。

Method: 我们提出了F3CRec，一个旨在平衡知识保留和适应的框架。F3CRec引入了两个关键组件：客户端自适应重放记忆和服务器端项目级时间均值。

Result: F3CRec在联邦环境中，在保持推荐质量方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: F3CRec在联邦环境中，在保持推荐质量方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

*Lin Jiang,Yu Yang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HCRide, a human-centered ride-hailing system using a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, Habic, to improve system efficiency, passenger fairness, and driver preference. HCRide outperforms existing systems in experiments using real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: design a human-centered ride-hailing system by considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference since optimizing one may sacrifice the other.

Method: a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic)

Result: HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%, fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: HCRide can effectively improves system efficiency, fairness, and driver preference compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a non-autoregressive flow matching framework for modeling long horizon marked event sequences, improving accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting.

Method: A unified flow matching framework for marked temporal point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding.

Result: Significant improvements over autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation efficiency on six real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed flow matching framework achieves significant improvements over autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation efficiency on six real-world benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文为OPTQ及其变体提供了量化误差的理论保证，并为实际应用提供了指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OPTQ框架（也称为GPTQ）已成为一种领先的方法，但缺乏严格的定量理论保证。

Method: 我们分析了OPTQ的迭代过程如何导致量化误差，并推导了依赖于校准数据和OPTQ使用的正则化参数的非渐近2-范数误差界限。对于随机变量，我们建立了更强的无穷范数误差界限。我们将分析扩展到Qronos，为其确定性和随机变体提供了新的理论界限。

Result: 为OPTQ的确定性和随机变体以及Qronos提供了第一个定量误差界限。我们的分析为一些实用的设计选择提供了理论依据，包括通过递减范数对特征进行排序的广泛使用的启发式方法，以及选择正则化参数的指导。

Conclusion: 本文为OPTQ的确定性和随机变体以及Qronos提供了第一个定量误差界限，并解释了其经验优势。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and
stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agnostics is a language-agnostic post-training method that improves code generation in low-resource languages by using verifiable rewards and a single verifier for all languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with low-resource languages due to data scarcity and the need for per-language post-training infrastructure.

Method: A language-agnostic post-training pipeline that judges code by its externally observable behavior, using an LLM to rewrite unit-test datasets into an I/O format and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).

Result: Agnostics improves Qwen-3 4B to performance rivaling 16B-70B models, scales to larger models, and sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on MultiPL-E and LiveCodeBench.

Conclusion: Agnostics improves code generation performance in low-resource languages, achieving state-of-the-art results on MultiPL-E and LiveCodeBench.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

TL;DR: Introduces Hilbert Neural Operator (HNO) to improve upon Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) by using Hilbert transform for better handling of causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain, making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information to learn an effective network.

Method: HNO operates by first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed representation.

Result: We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary systems.

Conclusion: We introduce the Hilbert Neural Operator (HNO), a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing.

Motivation: 探索动态是否可以直接在概率测度上实现。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型作为分布的灵活参数族，并结合Wasserstein梯度流理论来推导这些措施的训练动态。

Result: GM层表现出与经典全连接层不同的行为，即使后者足够大，可以被认为是在平均场状态。

Conclusion: GM层在简单分类任务上取得了与两层全连接网络相当的测试性能，并且表现出与经典全连接层不同的行为。

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate
width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether
dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures. Specifically,
we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

TL;DR: 提出了 Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR) 来解决在线广告系统中检索阶段和排序阶段之间的不一致性问题，经验证该方法有效，可提高收入和展示次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动投标策略的日益普及，计算敏感的检索阶段和排序阶段之间的不一致性变得更加明显，因为前者无法访问大量广告语料库的精确、实时投标。这种差异导致平台收入和广告商收益欠佳。

Method: Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR)，一个基于模型的检索框架，通过将广告出价纳入检索评分函数来解决多阶段不一致性问题。核心创新是 Bidding-Aware Modeling，通过单调约束学习和多任务蒸馏结合投标信号，以确保经济上连贯的表征，而异步近线推理能够实时更新嵌入，以提高市场响应能力。此外，任务感知细化模块选择性地增强特征交互，以解开用户兴趣和商业价值信号。

Result: 平台收入增加了 4.32%，正面运营广告的展示次数增加了 22.2%。

Conclusion: BAR在阿里巴巴的展示广告平台上进行了全面部署，经验证有效：平台收入增加了 4.32%，正面运营广告的展示次数增加了 22.2%。

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地表臭氧 (O3) 是一种重要的污染物，其趋势的驱动因素难以建模，传统的基于物理的模型在与人类健康影响相关的尺度上的实际应用不足。基于深度学习的模拟器在捕获复杂的气候模式方面显示出希望，但总体上缺乏支持政策变化和公共卫生措施的关键决策所需的解释性。

Method: 实现了一个不确定性感知 U-Net 架构，使用贝叶斯和分位数回归方法。

Result: 证明了我们的技术在 2019 年 6 月北美和欧洲区域偏差估计中的能力。我们强调了两种 UQ 方法之间的不确定性量化 (UQ) 分数，并辨别哪些地面站是 MOMO-Chem 偏差校正的最佳和次优候选者，并评估了土地利用信息对地表臭氧残留建模的影响。

Conclusion: 使用不确定性感知 U-Net 架构来预测 Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data assimilation (MOMO-Chem) 模型的地表臭氧残差（偏差）。

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

Conclusion: 该研究的结果可以提高我们对影响城市尺度臭氧偏差的因素的科学理解，这些因素可用于改进环境政策。

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的水位预测对于管理像 Everglades 这样的生态系统至关重要，但深度学习（尤其是时间序列基础模型）在水文学中的应用仍有待探索，并且由于缺乏有效的适应机制，它们通常难以在不同的未见数据集和领域中推广。

Method: 提出了将检索增强预测 (RAF) 引入水文学领域，构建了一个框架，该框架检索历史上类似的多元水文事件，以丰富预测前的模型输入。

Result: 在来自 Everglades 的真实世界数据上进行的综合评估表明，RAF 框架在水位预测精度方面产生了显着改进。

Conclusion: Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) 显著提高了 Everglades 水位预测的准确性，并为环境水文学中自适应 AI 方法的更广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practices often rely on inconsistent and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability. Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection.

Method: Using real and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics, consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters.

Result: Matthews and Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured expert-level AI performance.

Conclusion: We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure detection.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

*Santosh Chapagain,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores transformer-based models for hate speech detection, with fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing hate speech requires robust automated detection methods due to its prevalence and link to real-world hate crimes.

Method: Evaluate multiple state-of-the-art transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with fine-tuning.

Result: Achieved good results with transformer models; fine-tuned ELECTRA đạt được hiệu suất cao nhất (điểm F1: 0,8980).

Conclusion: Fine-tuned ELECTRA achieves the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980) on the MetaHate dataset.

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估DAL算法的新平台ALScope，发现DAL算法在不同场景下表现差异大，在非标准场景下仍有改进空间，且部分算法需要更长的选择时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用变得越来越复杂，源于分布偏移（例如，开放集识别）和数据不平衡的挑战越来越受到关注，促使人们开发了许多DAL算法。然而，缺乏统一的平台阻碍了在不同条件下进行公平和系统的评估。

Method: 构建了一个新的DAL平台ALScope，集成了来自计算机视觉（CV）和自然语言处理（NLP）的10个数据集，以及21个具有代表性的DAL算法。

Result: 在各种设置下进行了广泛的实验，发现DAL算法的性能在不同领域和任务设置中差异显著；在非标准场景（如不平衡和开放集设置）中，DAL算法仍有改进空间；一些算法表现良好，但需要更长的选择时间。

Conclusion: DAL算法的表现在不同领域和任务设置中差异显著；在非标准场景（如不平衡和开放集设置）中，DAL算法仍有改进空间，需要进一步研究；一些算法表现良好，但需要更长的选择时间。

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces REINA, a novel loss function for Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) that improves the balance between translation quality and latency. REINA achieves state-of-the-art streaming results and improves the latency/quality trade-off by 21% compared to prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems face the significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. The paper introduces a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you gain information by doing so.

Method: The paper presents Regularized Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. REINA is derived from information theory principles.

Result: REINA helps push the reported Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. The paper quantitatively shows REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: The paper achieves state-of-the-art streaming results for models of comparable size by training a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and into English, using only open source or synthetically generated data. The paper also introduces a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable

showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

### [174] [Self-Error Adjustment: Theory and Practice of Balancing Individual Performance and Diversity in Ensemble Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04948)
*Rui Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEA是一种用于集成学习的新框架，它通过将误差分解为个体性能和多样性项，并引入可调整的参数来实现对集成性能的精确控制，从而优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成学习通过聚合来自多个基础学习者的预测来提高性能。一个核心挑战是平衡个体学习者的准确性与多样性。传统的诸如Bagging和Boosting之类的方法通过随机性来促进多样性，但是缺乏对准确性-多样性折衷的精确控制。负相关学习（NCL）引入了一种惩罚来管理这种折衷，但是受到宽松的理论界限和有限的调整范围的限制。

Method: 我们提出了一个名为自误差调整（SEA）的新框架，该框架将集成误差分解为两个不同的组成部分：个体性能项和反映学习者之间相互作用的多样性项。这种分解使我们能够将可调整的参数引入损失函数中，从而可以精确控制每个组成部分的贡献，从而可以更好地调节集成性能。

Result: 在几个公共回归和分类数据集上的实验结果表明，与NCL及其变体相比，SEA提供了更广泛的有效调整范围以及更多样性的一致变化。此外，我们为可调整的集成方法建立了更严格的理论界限，并通过经验实验对其进行了验证。消融研究证实，SEA在微调策略中提供了更灵活的调整能力和卓越的性能。

Conclusion: SEA在所有任务中始终优于基线方法，并且在微调策略中提供了更灵活的调整能力和卓越的性能。

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct
components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each
base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss
function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,
thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning
strategies.

TL;DR: 本文设计了两种用于非凸随机优化的压缩分散式算法，在深度神经网络 (DNN) 和 Transformer 的训练中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然动量加速和压缩通信已在文献中使用，但从理论上证明它们在分散式算法中的组合的有效性非常重要，因为需要同时控制共识误差、压缩误差和来自动量梯度的偏差。

Method: 我们设计了两种压缩的分散式算法，用于解决两种不同场景下的非凸随机优化问题。两种算法都采用动量技术来实现快速收敛，并采用消息压缩技术来节省通信成本。

Result: 在训练深度神经网络 (DNN) 和 Transformer 时，观察到优于最新方法的卓越经验性能。

Conclusion: 两项方法均实现了最优收敛速度，并且在用户指定的误差容限范围内，它们可以实现线性加速并采用与拓扑无关的算法参数。

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

TL;DR: MENDR, a filter bank-based EEG foundation model, addresses transparency and interpretability issues in existing models by learning symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals. It achieves near state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters, making it efficient and clinically applicable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned representations.

Method: a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture

Result: MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings

Conclusion: MENDR achieves near state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG analysis.

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports
accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations
across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near
state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring
its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG
analysis.

Motivation: Obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often challenging.

Method: reservoir computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF)

Result: The RC component learns the nonlinear system dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF prediction step to generate state estimates. The UKF measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift in the data-driven model.

Conclusion: RCUKF effectiveness is demonstrated on benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task.

Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications,
yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir
computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven
modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system
dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF
prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic
regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF
measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift
in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known
benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

TL;DR: MMCI model uses causal intervention to address spurious correlations in multimodal sentiment analysis, improving generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) suffer from spurious correlations within and across modalities, leading to reliance on statistical shortcuts and undermining generalization.

Method: A Multi-relational Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model leveraging backdoor adjustment from causal theory.

Result: Demonstrates effective bias suppression and improved performance on standard MSA datasets and out-of-distribution test sets.

Conclusion: The proposed MMCI model effectively suppresses biases and improves performance on standard MSA datasets and out-of-distribution test sets.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

TL;DR: R-Zero是一个完全自主的框架，它通过挑战者和解决者的互动，从头开始生成自己的训练数据，从而提高了LLM的推理能力，无需任何预先存在的任务和标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的训练方法仍然严重依赖于大量人工管理的任务和标签，通常通过微调或强化学习，这对将人工智能系统提升到超越人类智能的能力构成了一个根本性的瓶颈。

Method: R-Zero引入了一个完全自主的框架，该框架从头开始生成自己的训练数据。从一个单一的基础LLM开始，R-Zero初始化两个具有不同角色的独立模型，一个挑战者和一个解决者。这些模型被分别优化，并通过互动共同进化：挑战者因提出接近解决者能力边缘的任务而获得奖励，而解决者因解决挑战者提出的越来越具有挑战性的任务而获得奖励。这个过程产生了一个有针对性的、自我改进的课程，没有任何预先存在的任务和标签。

Result: R-Zero在不同的主干LLM上大幅提高了推理能力，例如，在数学推理基准上将Qwen3-4B-Base提高了+6.49，在通用领域推理基准上提高了+7.54。

Conclusion: R-Zero通过在不同的主干LLM上大幅提高推理能力来证明了其有效性，例如，在数学推理基准上将Qwen3-4B-Base提高了+6.49，在通用领域推理基准上提高了+7.54。

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: Current curriculum learning or data selection approaches are heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their scalability and generalizability.

Method: SPaRFT, a self-paced learning framework with cluster-based data reduction and a multi-armed bandit for adaptive data selection.

Conclusion: Carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强现实（AR）系统在通过实时指导提高任务性能的同时，也存在诱发认知隧道效应的风险——过度关注虚拟内容，从而损害安全关键场景中的情境感知（SA）。

Method: 开发了一个在 Magic Leap 2 上的增强现实应用程序，该程序覆盖了实时心肺复苏反馈（压缩深度和速率），并进行了一项用户研究，其中模拟了意外事件（例如，出血）以评估情境感知，其中通过观察和在冻结探测事件期间管理的问卷收集情境感知指标。

Result: 眼动追踪分析表明，较高的情境感知水平与更大的扫视幅度和速度相关，并与虚拟内容的注视比例和频率降低相关。为了预测情境感知，我们提出了 FixGraphPool，一个图神经网络，它将注视事件（注视、扫视）构建成时空图，有效地捕捉动态注意力模式。我们的模型达到了 83.0% 的准确率（F1=81.0%），通过利用领域知识和编码在 ET 数据中的时空信息，优于基于特征的机器学习和最先进的时间序列模型。

Conclusion: 眼动追踪技术在增强现实情境感知建模方面具有潜力，并突显了其在设计确保用户安全和情境感知的增强现实系统中的实用性。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

Conclusion: KNOW预测优于朴素微调和简单权重预测，从而带来卓越的下游性能。这项工作为重新解释遗忘动态以推动深度学习中知识转移的极限提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

Method: 引入TANGO，一个受动态系统启发的图表示学习框架，该框架通过学习的能量景观及其相关的下降动力学来控制节点特征的演变。其核心是一种可学习的节点嵌入Lyapunov函数，其梯度定义了一个能量减少方向，保证了收敛性和稳定性。为了在保持基于能量的动力学优势的同时增强灵活性，我们引入了一种新的切向分量，通过消息传递学习，在保持能量值的同时演化特征。

Result: TANGO减轻了过度压缩，并且与不同的图神经网络主干兼容。TANGO在节点和图分类以及回归基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: TANGO在节点和图分类以及回归基准测试中表现出色，证明了联合学习能量函数和切向流对于图神经网络的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

Result: ULU在图像分类和目标检测任务中显著优于ReLU和Mish。

Conclusion: ULU显著优于ReLU和Mish，并且提出了LIB指标来衡量模型的归纳偏置。

Abstract: We propose \textbf{ULU}, a novel non-monotonic, piecewise activation function

$f(x;\alpha)=0.5x(tanh(\alpha x)+1),\alpha >0$. ULU treats positive and
negative inputs differently. Extensive experiments demonstrate ULU
significantly outperforms ReLU and Mish across image classification and object
detection tasks. Its variant Adaptive ULU (\textbf{AULU}) is expressed as
$\{f(x;\beta_1^2),x<0; f(x;\beta_2^2),x>=0 \}$, where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$
are learnable parameters, enabling it to adapt its response separately for
positive and negative inputs. Additionally, we introduce the LIB (Like
Inductive Bias) metric from AULU to quantitatively measure the inductive bias
of the model.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Integrated Influence, a data attribution method addressing limitations of existing methods by incorporating a baseline and considering collective influence. It demonstrates improved reliability in data attribution and mislabeled example identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the training set.  The lack of baseline in many data attribution methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide counterfactual explanations.

Method: Integrated Influence incorporates a baseline approach. It defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each sample throughout this process.

Result: Theoretical framework and experimental results demonstrate that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled example identification task.

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于冷启动主动偏好学习的新框架，该框架通过自监督预训练和主动学习循环来解决冷启动问题，优于标准主动学习策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动偏好学习是一种用于有效建模偏好的强大范例，但它存在冷启动问题：当没有可用的初始标记数据时，性能会显着下降。在计算社会系统和经济分析中，这一挑战尤为严峻，在这些系统中，标记数据通常稀缺、昂贵且容易受到专家噪声的影响。

Method: 通过自监督预训练阶段启动学习过程，利用主成分分析 (PCA) 从数据的内在结构中导出初始伪标签，从而创建一个无需任何初始oracle交互的冷启动模型。随后，通过主动学习循环细化模型，该循环策略性地查询模拟的噪声oracle以获取标签。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的冷启动方法优于从零开始的标准主动学习策略，以更少的标记对实现了更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过在数据受限的环境中增强样本效率和偏好学习的适用性，为缓解冷启动问题提供了一种实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple relational perspectives. The method integrates two distinct forms of weak labels: similarity-confidence and confidence-difference, and introduces two types of unbiased risk estimators for classification. The proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines across a variety of settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a single type of weak supervision.

Method: SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against inaccurate class prior probability and label noise.

Result: achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to estimation error bounds. introduce a risk correction approach to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against inaccurate class prior probability and label noise.

Motivation: Current training approaches fail to develop robust reasoning strategies for function calling.

TL;DR: 提出了HFedATM，一种用于分层联邦域泛化的新方法，通过对齐卷积滤波器和使用收缩感知正则化平均聚合来提高性能，并在多个数据集上进行了验证，同时保持了计算和通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的联邦学习由于参与设备数量的增长，对单个中央服务器提出了过度的计算和通信需求，面临可扩展性挑战。分层联邦学习(HFL)通过在中间节点(站点)上分配模型聚合任务来解决这些问题，从而增强了系统可扩展性和针对单点故障的鲁棒性。然而，HFL仍然存在一个关键但经常被忽视的限制:域偏移，即数据分布在不同的客户端和站点之间差异很大，从而降低了模型在未见过的目标域上的性能。虽然联邦域泛化(FedDG)方法已经出现以提高对域偏移的鲁棒性，但它们与HFL框架的集成在很大程度上仍未被探索。

Method: 提出了一种分层聚合方法HFedATM，该方法首先通过滤波器方式最优传输对齐来对齐来自不同站点的模型的卷积滤波器，然后使用收缩感知正则化平均聚合来合并对齐的模型。

Result: HFedATM在多个数据集上显著提高了现有FedDG基线的性能，并保持了计算和通信效率。理论分析表明，与标准分层平均相比，HFedATM实现了更严格的泛化误差界限，从而实现了更快的收敛和稳定的训练行为。

Conclusion: HFedATM显著提升了现有FedDG基线在多个数据集上的性能，并保持了计算和通信效率。理论分析表明，与标准分层平均相比，HFedATM实现了更严格的泛化误差界限，从而实现了更快的收敛和稳定的训练行为。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

Conclusion: deep networks with general activations can approximate weak solutions of PDEs with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element

\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the
error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the use of domain-driven rewards alongside traditional metrics for policy optimization in a rational ABM disease modeling case study, considering scenarios like differential mask availability.

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and
rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as
reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化联邦学习(pFL)方法大多假设客户端参与是静态的，这不能反映新客户端可能不断加入联邦系统(即动态客户端加入)的真实场景。本文探讨了一种实际场景，其中在学习任务保持不变的情况下，增量引入一批新客户端。这种动态环境带来了各种挑战，包括在不重新训练的情况下保持现有客户端的性能，以及实现客户端批次之间的高效知识转移。

Method: 基于中心超网络的个性化联邦无数据子超网络(pFedDSH)，通过嵌入向量为每个客户端生成个性化模型。为了保持现有客户端的知识稳定性，pFedDSH包含特定于批次的掩码，这些掩码激活神经元的子集以保持知识。此外，我们引入了一种受DeepInversion启发的无数据重放策略，以促进后向转移，在不损害隐私的情况下提高现有客户端的性能。

Conclusion: pFedDSH在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上优于最先进的pFL和联邦持续学习基线，实现了现有客户端的鲁棒性能稳定性、新客户端的适应性以及神经资源的高效利用。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

Conclusion: S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA) decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution for AAD tasks.

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often

HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify the best performing algorithm from a collection of competing machine learning algorithms on a benchmark of datasets, specifically which algorithm is most likely to rank highest on a future, unseen dataset; performance differences are marginal and additional candidates may also be considered.

Method: Formulated as subset selection for multinomial distributions; introduces a novel framework for the subset selection problem; provides asymptotic and finite-sample schemes.

Result: Schemes that significantly improve upon currently known methods; matching lower bounds, demonstrating the favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel framework for the subset selection problem, provides both asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently known methods, and gives matching lower bounds.

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday activities

Method: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with minimal overhead

Result: The HAR model showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively. For everyday activities, the proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high performance across 9 smartphone wear locations, outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%.

Conclusion: The proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical applicability.

Abstract: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with
minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday
activities (walking, running, stairs, standing, sitting, lying, sit-to-stand
transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data
from adult healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0.0-6.5. Datasets
included the GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728), an internal Roche dataset, and
publicly available data sources (training only). Data from 34 HC and 68 PwMS
(mean [SD] EDSS: 4.7 [1.5]) were included in the evaluation. The HAR model
showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in
the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively, similar to a comparative
state-of-the-art ResNet model (99.3% and 99.4%). For everyday activities, the
proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high
performance across 9 smartphone wear locations (handbag, shopping bag,
crossbody bag, backpack, hoodie pocket, coat/jacket pocket, hand, neck, belt),
outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the
proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high
robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical
applicability.

TL;DR: PITI-DeepONet 优于 FR 和 AR 方法，因为它通过学习时间导数算子并结合残差监控来提高长期预测的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确地建模和推断扩展范围内随时间变化的偏微分方程 (PDE) 的解仍然是科学机器学习中的一个核心挑战。传统的完整展开 (FR) 方法（一步预测整个轨迹）通常无法捕捉因果依赖关系，并且在训练时间范围之外泛化能力较差。自回归 (AR) 方法逐步演化系统，会受到误差累积的影响，从而限制了长期准确性。这些缺点限制了这两种策略的长期准确性和可靠性。

Method: 我们引入了物理信息时间积分深度算子网络 (PITI-DeepONet)，这是一种双输出架构，通过完全物理信息或混合物理和数据驱动的目标进行训练，以确保在超出训练范围的时间范围内实现稳定、准确的长期演化。

Result: 应用于基准问题时，与传统方法相比，PITI-DeepONet 在更长的推理时间范围内表现出更高的准确性。一维热方程的平均相对 $\mathcal{L}_2$ 误差降低了 84%（与 FR 相比）和 79%（与 AR 相比）；一维 Burgers 方程降低了 87%（与 FR 相比）和 98%（与 AR 相比）；二维 Allen-Cahn 方程降低了 42%（与 FR 相比）和 89%（与 AR 相比）。

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet 通过超越经典的 FR 和 AR 方案，为更可靠地长期整合复杂、随时间变化的 PDE 铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
