### [1] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究调查了大型语言模型中不良行为（如欺骗性）是否可以被移除，或者它们是否与模型的核心认知能力密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的安全性和可控性至关重要。核心问题是不良行为是否是可以移除的局部功能，还是与模型的核心认知能力紧密相连。

Method: 我们引入了“循环消融”的迭代方法来测试这一点。通过结合稀疏自动编码器、目标消融和DistilGPT-2上的对抗训练，我们试图消除欺骗的概念。

Result: 我们发现，与局部化假设相反，欺骗具有很强的弹性。在每次消融循环后，模型通过对抗训练持续恢复其欺骗行为，我们称之为功能再生。

Conclusion: 这些发现与复杂概念是分布式的和纠缠的观点相一致，强调了通过机制可解释性进行直接模型编辑的局限性。

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

### [2] [From Internal Representations to Text Quality: A Geometric Approach to LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25359)
*Viacheslav Yusupov,Danil Maksimov,Ameliia Alaeva,Anna Vasileva,Anna Antipina,Tatyana Zaitseva,Alina Ermilova,Evgeny Burnaev,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过论证内部模型表征的几何属性可以作为评估生成文本质量的可靠指标，从而连接了大型语言模型（LLM）的内部和外部分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型内部机制与生成文本质量之间的关系。

Method: 通过测量LLM不同层的最大可解释方差、有效秩、固有维度、MAUVE得分和Schatten范数等指标，验证了固有维度和有效秩可以作为文本自然性和质量的通用评估。

Result: 研究发现不同的模型基于这些几何属性对来自不同来源的文本进行一致排序，表明这些指标反映了固有的文本特征，而不是特定于模型的伪像。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种无需参考的文本质量评估方法，该方法不需要人工标注的数据集，为自动评估流程提供了实际优势。

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

### [3] [Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25369)
*Andy Liu,Kshitish Ghate,Mona Diab,Daniel Fried,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种名为ConflictScope的自动流程，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在面对价值冲突时如何进行优先级排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐数据集中的价值冲突稀缺，导致LLM助手在部署时经常需要在价值之间进行权衡。

Method: 该流程自动生成LLM在用户定义的一组价值观中面临冲突的场景，通过LLM编写的“用户提示”来提示目标模型，并评估其自由文本响应，从而引出价值观的排序。

Result: 研究发现，在更开放的价值冲突环境中，模型会减少对保护性价值（如无害性）的支持，而更多地支持个人价值（如用户自主性）。在模型的系统提示中包含详细的价值排序可以提高14%的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 这项工作表明了评估模型中价值优先级的重要性，并为该领域的未来工作奠定了基础。

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

### [4] [From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25409)
*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的奖励模型，名为 Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM)，用于提高大型语言模型在开放域问答等复杂任务中的性能。TRM 通过结合句子级别的思考监督，使奖励模型具备批判性思维能力，从而更好地评估答案的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法在开放域问答等复杂任务中面临挑战，因为很难验证答案的正确性。以往的研究主要集中在提高与支持文档的语义一致性，导致模型过度依赖外部信息，削弱了其批判性评估能力。

Method: 该论文提出了 TRM，它通过将奖励建模分解为 faithfulness、推理和正确性评估的序列，鼓励模型批判性地评估和利用外部和内部知识。TRM 首先评估每个答案句子与支持文档的 faithfulness，然后应用推理步骤来评估句子级别的正确性。

Result: 实验表明，TRM 能够显著提高识别错误句子的能力，并且将其整合到策略优化中可以显著提高答案的正确性和有用性。

Conclusion: TRM 是一种有效的奖励模型，可以提高大型语言模型在开放域问答等复杂任务中的性能。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

### [5] [Emotion-Aligned Generation in Diffusion Text to Speech Models via Preference-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25416)
*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Yangfan He,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为情感感知逐步偏好优化 (EASPO) 的后训练框架，用于使扩散 TTS 与中间去噪步骤中的细粒度情感偏好保持一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的情感文本到语音方法依赖于粗略的标签或代理分类器，并且仅接收话语级别的反馈。

Method: 引入了 EASPM，这是一种时间条件模型，可以对嘈杂的中间语音状态进行评分，并支持自动偏好对构建。EASPO 优化生成以匹配这些逐步偏好，从而实现可控的情感塑造。

Result: 实验表明，在表达性和自然性方面，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EASPO 是一种很有前途的情感 TTS 方法，它能够生成更具表现力和自然性的语音。

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

### [6] [SimulRAG: Simulator-based RAG for Grounding LLMs in Long-form Scientific QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25459)
*Haozhou Xu,Dongxia Wu,Matteo Chinazzi,Ruijia Niu,Rose Yu,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在解决科学问题方面展现出潜力，但存在幻觉问题。本文提出了一种基于模拟器的检索增强生成框架（SimulRAG），以提高长篇科学问答的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在长篇科学问答中存在幻觉问题，需要提高答案的事实性。

Method: 提出SimulRAG框架，包含一个广义的模拟器检索界面，以及一个利用不确定性估计和模拟器边界评估的声明级生成方法。

Result: SimulRAG在信息量和事实性方面优于传统RAG基线，分别提高了30.4%和16.3%。

Conclusion: SimulRAG框架有效地利用科学模拟器缓解了大型语言模型的幻觉问题，提高了长篇科学问答的质量和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

### [8] [Not Wrong, But Untrue: LLM Overconfidence in Document-Based Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25498)
*Nick Hagar,Wilma Agustianto,Nicholas Diakopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在新闻编辑室工作流程中得到越来越多的应用，但它们产生幻觉的倾向对新闻业的核心实践（如信息来源、归属和准确性）构成了风险。本研究评估了三种广泛使用的工具——ChatGPT、Gemini 和 NotebookLM——在一项以 300 份与美国 TikTok 诉讼和政策相关的文件为基础的报告式任务中的表现。研究改变了提示的特异性和上下文大小，并使用分类法标注句子级输出，以衡量幻觉类型和严重程度。在我们的样本中，30% 的模型输出包含至少一个幻觉，其中 Gemini 和 ChatGPT 的比率（40%）大约是 NotebookLM（13%）的三倍。从定性角度来看，大多数错误不涉及捏造的实体或数字；相反，我们观察到解释上的过度自信——模型添加了对来源的无根据描述，并将归属的观点转化为一般性陈述。这些模式揭示了一种根本性的认知不匹配：虽然新闻业要求每项声明都有明确的来源，但 LLM 会生成听起来权威的文本，而不管是否有证据支持。我们提出了对现有幻觉分类法的针对新闻业的扩展，并认为有效的新闻编辑室工具需要强制执行准确归属的架构，而不是优化流畅性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究深入分析了Whisper多语种解码器的内部工作机制，特别是其在不同资源水平语言上的公平性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型多语种自动语音识别（ASR）模型内部机制，尤其是在跨语言的公平性和有效性方面。

Method: 通过追踪Beam Search路径，捕捉子词猜测及其相关概率，对Whisper的多语种解码器进行细粒度分析。

Result: 研究结果表明，较高资源语言的正确token排名更高，置信度更高，预测熵更低，备选方案更多样；较低资源语言在这些指标上表现较差，但在子词使用中表现出明显的聚类模式，有时受类型学的影响。

Conclusion: 子词探测揭示了被总体错误率掩盖的系统性解码差异，并指出了旨在改善语音技术不平衡发展的有针对性的干预措施。

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

TL;DR: MixtureVitae是一个开源的预训练语料库，旨在最小化法律风险，同时提供强大的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个在法律上安全的语料库，减少对无差别网络抓取的依赖。

Method: 结合公共领域、许可文本、低风险补充数据和合成数据，采用透明的多阶段流程进行许可过滤、安全和质量筛选以及领域混合。

Result: 在受控实验中，使用MixtureVitae训练的模型在标准基准测试中始终优于其他许可数据集，并且在1.7B/300B设置下，性能超过FineWeb-Edu，接近DCLM。

Conclusion: 许可优先、风险缓解的数据为训练有能力的LLM提供了实用且法律上得到缓解的基础，减少了对无差别网络抓取的依赖，同时不牺牲竞争力。

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [11] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型(LLM)的置信度估计需要校准，以获得人类用户的信任。本文提出了一种名为Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)的方法，通过估计和解释LLM的易受暗示偏差来校准置信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的置信度估计常常存在偏差，即在低准确率的情况下报告高置信度，从而损害信任和安全。作者认为这种过度自信源于LLM在面对缺乏信息的声明时，其高度的易受暗示性。

Method: 本文提出了Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)方法，该方法通过让模型独立地对其自身生成的几个干扰项（即替代声明）表达置信度，并通过总的口头置信度进行归一化，从而估计和解释LLM的易受暗示偏差。此外，本文还利用生成器-验证器不一致性，通过基于一致性的生成器置信度估计来增强归一化的验证器置信度。

Result: DINCO提供了不那么饱和的（因此更可用的）置信度估计，并且仅靠进一步的抽样无法缩小DINCO和基线之间的差距，在10次推理调用中，DINCO的表现优于100次的自洽性。

Conclusion: DINCO方法能够更有效地校准LLM的置信度估计，从而提高LLM的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自奖励的基于规则的强化学习框架，用于开放式推理，该框架更轻量级、资源效率更高，并且性能优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在研究 HealthBench 时，发现使用模型本身作为评分器并生成基于规则的奖励信号可以显著提高推理性能。训练后的模型也成为了更强大的评分器。

Method: 引入了一种自奖励的基于规则的强化学习方法，用于开放式推理。

Result: 在 Qwen3-32B 上，仅使用 4000 个样本的 HealthBench Easy 子集进行训练就足以获得一个在 HealthBench Hard 上超过 GPT-5 的模型。

Conclusion: 自奖励的基于规则的强化学习框架能够以更快的速度和更高的资源效率进行训练，并且性能优于基线。

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架，通过利用高性能英语LLM作为“枢轴”模型来增强多语言推理能力，解决了强化学习在多语言环境中性能差距大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在LLM中主要提升了英语的推理能力，导致跨语言性能差异显著。

Method: 提出基于枢轴的强化学习与语义可验证奖励（PB-RLSVR）框架，该框架使用高性能英语LLM生成参考答案，并基于多语言模型答案与英语参考答案的语义等价性进行奖励。

Result: 在多语言推理基准测试中，PB-RLSVR 显著缩小了英语和其他语言之间的性能差距，分别提高了 Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct 和 Qwen3-32B 的平均多语言性能 16.41% 和 10.17%。

Conclusion: PB-RLSVR 是一种强大且数据高效的方法，可用于构建真正的多语言推理代理。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

Motivation: 解释了儿童在习得语法的过程中，经常会省略主语，并且会将祈使句和陈述句混淆。

Method: 通过引入一个新的计算参数来衡量这种误解，并将其纳入一个强制性主语语法学习的模拟模型中。该模型是 Variational Learner 的修改版，适用于超集-子集语言。

Result: 模拟结果支持了 Orfitelli 和 Hyams 的假设。

Conclusion: 本研究概述了一个框架，用于将计算模型整合到语法习得的研究中，同时考虑其他关键的发展因素。

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

*Colten DiIanni,Daniel Deutsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP)，一种新的句子级别机器翻译meta-评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决以前基于Pearson’s ρ和Kendall’s τ的meta-评估方法的局限性。

Method: PDP是一种基于相关性的指标，它利用成对差异而不是原始分数。它利用来自所有句子的信息来更稳健地理解分数分布，并使用句子级别的成对差异来将Global Pearson细化为句子内分数比较。

Result: 在WMT'24共享任务上的分析表明，PDP可以正确地对哨兵评估指标进行排序，并且比以前的工作更好地与人工误差权重对齐。噪声注入分析表明，PDP对随机噪声、句子偏差和系统偏差具有鲁棒性，同时突出了其对极端离群值的敏感性。

Conclusion: 提出的PDP指标在机器翻译meta-评估中表现更好，更鲁棒。

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

*Asma Farajidizaji,Akash Gupta,Vatsal Raina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格图像标题生成方面的zero-shot能力不足的问题，并探讨了使用少量偏好数据对齐这些模型以实现风格饱和的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的视觉语言模型在zero-shot环境下生成特定风格（如幽默或浪漫）的图像标题时表现不佳，并且获取偏好数据的成本很高，限制了模型能力的探索。

Method: 研究了对齐小型视觉语言模型到幽默和浪漫风格的数据效率。

Result: 定义了这些模型的性能限制，并确定了实现风格饱和所需的最小偏好数据量。

Conclusion: 对模型的性能和局限性进行了基准测试。

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

*Tianlang Chen,Minkai Xu,Jure Leskovec,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为无奖励引导（RFG）的方法，用于指导扩散大型语言模型（dLLMs）的推理轨迹，无需显式的过程奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归语言模型通常需要对每个中间步骤进行密集注释以学习过程奖励模型，但这对于生成方式为任意顺序且中间状态为部分掩码句子的dLLMs来说具有挑战性。

Method: 通过增强和参考dLLMs的对数似然比来参数化过程奖励。增强模型可以通过任何经过强化学习（RL）或监督微调（SFT）的现成dLLM轻松获得。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的数学推理和代码生成基准测试中进行了全面的实验，RFG在所有任务和模型类型中始终如一地产生显着改进，准确率提高了9.2%。

Conclusion: RFG是一种通用的免训练框架，可以在不依赖外部奖励模型的情况下扩展测试时推理。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

*Takashi Furuya,Maarten V. de Hoop,Matti Lassas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了transformers在概率测度上的映射能力，并从数学上统一分析了它们的表达性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究transformers处理大量上下文tokens的能力，并为神经网络在概率测度上的映射建模，应用于Wasserstein正则性研究、泛化界限证明和平均场极限分析。

Method: 通过push forward表征上下文映射，刻画了transformers在测度之间的映射属性。研究了Vlasov方程的解映射，并证明了平均场测度自注意力具有相关性质。

Result: Transformers能够通过上下文映射来表示测度之间的映射，并且transformers能够普遍近似任何连续的上下文映射。Vlasov方程的解映射满足条件，可以被transformer近似。平均场测度自注意力具有保证无限深度transformer可以被视为Vlasov流的性质。

Conclusion: 本文从理论上分析了transformers在处理概率测度时的映射能力，并将其与Vlasov方程联系起来，为理解和应用transformers提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

*Samar Haider,Amir Tohidi,Jenny S. Wang,Timothy Dörr,David M. Rothschild,Chris Callison-Burch,Duncan J. Watts*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个用于大规模研究新闻报道中选择和框架偏差的实时数据集和计算框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 衡量媒体偏见的微妙形式仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 该流程将大型语言模型（LLM）与可扩展的近实时新闻抓取相结合，以提取结构化注释，包括政治倾向、语气、主题、文章类型和重大事件。

Result: 量化了多个层面的报道维度，并发布了一个交互式网络平台。

Conclusion: 建立了一种可重用的方法来大规模研究媒体偏见，为未来的研究提供实证资源。

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

*David Beauchemin,Pier-Luc Veilleux,Richard Khoury,Johanna-Pascale Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估LLM在魁北克法语语法现象上的语言知识的语料库QFrBLiMP，包含1761个最小配对，并标注了20种语言现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在评估LLM在魁北克法语语法现象上的能力。

Method: 通过人工修改从魁北克政府机构维护的官方在线资源中提取的句子来创建最小配对。每个配对由12位魁北克法语母语者进行注释，选择他们认为符合语法的句子。使用这些注释将LLM的能力与人类的能力进行比较。

Result: 发现语法能力随模型大小而扩展，但出现了一个明显的难度等级。所有基准模型在需要深刻语义理解的现象上都持续失败，揭示了一个关键的局限性，以及与人类在这些特定任务上的表现相比存在显著差距。

Conclusion: LLM在需要深刻语义理解的魁北克法语语法现象方面存在局限性，与人类水平差距明显。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了基准测试的可靠性，提出了“基准和谐性”的概念，用于衡量模型在基准测试各个子领域上的表现是否均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保基准测试的可靠性对于可信的评估和有意义的进展至关重要。现有的基准测试可能存在误导性结果，因为整体准确率可能受到特定子领域的过度影响。

Method: 通过计算模型在多个选择题基准测试中，在各个子领域上的表现的均值和方差，将每个基准测试映射到一个均值-方差平面上。

Result: 分析表明，不和谐的基准测试会给出误导性结果，因为整体准确率可能受到特定子领域的过度影响。例如，ARC-Easy主要被生物概念的问题所主导。

Conclusion: 建议在报告准确率的同时报告和谐性，将评估从简单的性能平均值重新定义为更稳健、分布可靠的性能衡量标准。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

*Dianqing Liu,Yi Liu,Guoqing Jin,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的模型去偏见框架BiasUnlearn，它通过双路径非学习机制协调刻板印象遗忘和反刻板印象保留来实现有针对性的去偏见，同时通过对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换来防止偏见极性反转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么会显著降低文本连贯性和任务准确性等核心能力，要么只对预定义的触发词有效，无法解决模型参数中深层嵌入的刻板印象关联。

Method: 该方法利用双路径非学习机制协调刻板印象遗忘和反刻板印象保留，并通过对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换来防止偏见极性反转。

Result: BiasUnlearn在减轻语言模型中的偏见方面优于现有方法，同时保留了语言建模能力。去偏见权重可以在不同的模型变体之间转移。

Conclusion: 偏见表征在预训练期间变得根深蒂固，并在微调阶段持续存在。

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MoE路由机制，可以自适应地为每个token在不同层分配专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合PEFT和MoE是LLM适应下游任务的有效策略，但现有方法依赖于TopK路由，需要仔细调整超参数并为每个token分配固定数量的专家。

Method: 提出LD-MoLE，一种可学习的动态路由机制，用于LoRA专家混合，实现自适应、token依赖和层级的专家分配。用可微路由函数和闭式解代替不可微的TopK选择。引入分析稀疏控制目标来规范激活专家的数量。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B和Llama-3.2-3B模型上的大量实验表明，LD-MoLE在各种基准测试中实现了比最先进的基线更高的平均分数。

Conclusion: LD-MoLE不仅实现了卓越的性能，而且展示了学习token依赖和层级专家分配的能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的评估数学原子能力的方法，通过将复杂问题分解为多个基本原子能力来评估LLM是否真正获得了数学概念和推理原则，而不是仅仅记住训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型推理模型主要依靠扩展具有多样化数学问题和长思考链的训练数据集，这引发了关于LLM是否真正获得数学概念和推理原则或仅仅记住训练数据的问题。

Method: 本文将原子能力分为两个维度：(1) 跨越四个主要数学领域的领域特定能力，代数、几何、分析和拓扑，(2) 不同层次的逻辑能力，包括概念理解、使用形式数学语言的正向多步推理和反例驱动的向后推理。本文为每个原子能力单元提出了相应的训练和评估数据集，并进行了广泛的实验，以了解不同的原子能力如何相互影响，从而探索引发所需特定原子能力的策略。

Result: 在高级模型上的评估和实验结果表明，关于模型在各种原子能力上的不同表现以及原子能力之间的相互作用，有许多有趣的发现和启发。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果强调了将数学智能解耦为原子组成部分的重要性，为模型认知提供了新的见解，并指导了训练策略的发展，使其朝着更高效、可转移和认知基础的“原子思维”范式发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感领域的合成文本生成提供了一种实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

Motivation: 现有研究采用一次性生成方法合成多轮对话样本，导致治疗保真度低，未能捕捉到每个回复背后的决策原理。

Method: 该框架引入了渐进式对话合成策略，从客户的自我报告中提取目标、资源和解决方案，并将它们组织成结构化大纲，然后逐步生成阶段对齐的咨询对话。此外，还提出了记忆驱动的动态规划思维模式，集成了记忆增强、全局规划和策略推理；然后，协作式多智能体优化器利用MDP将显式的思维链附加到每个对话轮次。

Result: 大量的实验和人工评估表明，CATCH显著提高了AI咨询的保真度和逻辑连贯性。

Conclusion: CATCH框架有效地提高了AI咨询的质量，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的成功在很大程度上取决于大规模、高质量的指令跟随和强化数据集。然而，通过人工注释生成此类数据非常耗时，尤其是在电信网络故障排除等特定领域任务中，准确的响应需要深厚的技术专业知识和上下文理解。

Method: 一个多阶段框架，集成了检索器、基础生成器和细化模型，以使用从领域特定知识图检索的文档来合成和增强 QA 对。为了确保数据质量，我们采用定制的基于 RAGAS 的评分来过滤低质量样本，从而生成适用于强化微调 (RFT) 的高质量数据集。

Result: 生成复杂的、上下文丰富的故障排除解决方案计划，无需人工干预。

Conclusion: 提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，用于在专门领域中构建指令和强化数据集，从而显着减少对手动标记的依赖，同时保持较高的技术保真度。

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Conclusion: 这项工作有助于开发多语言、细粒度的希望言语检测模型，可用于加强积极的内容审核，并培养支持性的在线社区。

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based

three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all
languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation
and foster supportive online communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TruthRL的强化学习框架，旨在直接优化大型语言模型的真实性，通过区分正确答案、幻觉和弃权的三元奖励，鼓励模型在不确定时选择弃权，从而减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在问答方面表现出色，但容易产生幻觉和不真实的回答，尤其是在需要超出其参数知识的信息时。现有方法难以平衡准确性和避免幻觉，优化准确性的方法会放大幻觉，鼓励弃权的方法会过于保守。

Method: 使用GRPO实现TruthRL，设计了一个简单有效的三元奖励，区分正确答案、幻觉和弃权。鼓励模型通过提供正确答案和在不确定时选择弃权来减少幻觉。

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，与vanilla RL相比，TruthRL显著减少了28.9%的幻觉，提高了21.1%的真实性。在各种backbone模型（例如，Qwen，Llama）下，在检索和非检索设置下都获得了持续的收益。

Conclusion: TruthRL在准确性和真实性方面都取得了强大的性能，强调了学习目标设计对于开发真实的LLM的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

*Obed Junias,Prajakta Kini,Theodora Chaspari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于语言的自动抑郁症检测模型中的算法偏差，重点关注与性别和种族/民族相关的社会人口差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在调查和减轻语言模型中抑郁症检测的偏见，特别是在性别和种族方面。

Method: 对比了基于深度神经网络(DNN)嵌入的模型与大型语言模型(LLM)的少样本学习方法，评估了DAIC-WOZ临床访谈记录的性能和公平性。采用公平感知损失函数减轻DNN模型的偏差，并探索了LLM的不同prompt框架和shot计数的上下文学习。

Result: LLM在抑郁症分类中优于DNN模型，尤其是在西班牙裔等代表性不足的群体中。与DNN相比，LLM的性别偏见也有所减少，但种族差异仍然存在。在缓解DNN偏差的公平感知技术中，最差组损失在性能和公平性之间取得了更好的平衡。在LLM中，带有伦理框架的引导prompt有助于减轻1-shot设置中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: LLM在减少性别偏见方面表现更好，但种族差异仍然是一个挑战。最差组损失是缓解DNN模型偏见的一种有效方法。对于LLM，引导prompt可以减轻性别偏见，但增加shot数并不能进一步减少差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

Motivation: Global sensemaking in question answering, synthesizing information from an entire corpus, remains a significant challenge. Existing graph-based approaches lack retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incur high inference costs.

Method: Proposes ReTAG, a framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and retrieves relevant summaries for response generation.

Result: ReTAG improves response quality and significantly reduces inference time compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: ReTAG effectively addresses the limitations of prior graph-based approaches for global sensemaking.

Abstract: Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的框架DECS，用于解决大型推理模型中的“过度思考”问题，即模型生成过长的推理路径但没有性能提升。DECS通过分离的token级别奖励机制和课程批量调度策略，在减少推理token的同时保持甚至提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型存在“过度思考”的问题，影响了它们的实际应用。现有的惩罚长度的方法通常会失败，因为轨迹级别的奖励和token级别的优化之间存在根本的不一致。

Method: 该论文提出了DECS框架，包括分离的token级别奖励机制，可以区分和惩罚冗余token，以及新的课程批量调度策略，以掌握效率和功效的平衡。

Result: 实验结果表明，DECS可以在七个基准测试中将推理token减少50%以上，同时保持或提高性能。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，可以在不影响模型底层推理能力的情况下，大幅提高推理效率。

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究发现，解释容易说服用户相信不准确的 VLM 预测是正确的。为了纠正对 VLM 预测的不良过度依赖。

Method: 我们提出了两种互补的 VLM 生成解释的质量，通过两个质量评分函数进行评估。我们提出了视觉保真度，它捕捉了解释对视觉上下文的忠实程度，以及对比性，它捕捉了解释如何识别视觉细节，从而将模型的预测与合理的替代方案区分开来。

Result: 在 A-OKVQA 和 VizWiz 任务中，这些质量评分函数比现有的解释质量更好地与模型正确性校准。我们进行了一项用户研究，参与者必须在不查看其视觉上下文的情况下确定 VLM 预测是否准确。我们观察到，显示我们的质量分数以及 VLM 解释，可以将参与者预测 VLM 正确性的准确率提高 11.1%，包括错误地相信不正确预测的比率降低 15.4%。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了解释质量分数在培养对 VLM 预测的适当依赖方面的效用。

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）经常捏造科学事实，严重损害了其可信度。为了解决这个问题，需要超越二元事实性的基准，并实现细粒度的评估。

Method: 论文构建了一个包含1001个专家标注的问答对的基准数据集ReFACT，每个实例都包含一个科学上正确的答案和一个非事实的对应答案，并标注了精确的错误范围和错误类型。

Result: 对9个最先进的LLM进行了基准测试，发现性能有限（约50%的准确率）。即使是GPT-4o等顶级模型也无法区分事实和捏造的科学答案。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调需要细粒度的、经过人工验证的基准来检测和纠正特定领域背景下的科学confabulation。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely
undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires
benchmarks that go beyond binary factuality and enable fine-grained evaluation.
We introduce \textbf{ReFACT} (\textit{Reddit False And Correct Texts}), a

annotated with \textbf{precise error spans and error-types}. ReFACT enables
multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在角色冲突情境下的行为，这些情境涉及多个角色期望的冲突。研究表明，LLMs在这些复杂社会困境中表现出一定的环境敏感性，但不足以克服其固有的偏见，尤其是在家庭、职业、男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在人类决策中变得越来越重要，理解它们在复杂社会情境中的行为至关重要。以往研究主要评估LLMs在有预定义正确答案的语境下的社交能力，而角色冲突代表着固有的模糊社会困境，需要环境敏感性。

Method: 论文引入了RoleConflictBench，这是一个新的基准，旨在评估LLMs在复杂社会困境中的环境敏感性。该基准采用三阶段流程，生成了超过13K个现实的角色冲突场景，涵盖65个角色，并系统地改变了相关的期望和情境紧急程度。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs在一定程度上能够对环境线索做出反应，但这种敏感性不足。相反，它们的决策主要受到与社会角色相关的强大固有偏见的影响。分析量化了这些偏见，揭示了对家庭和职业领域角色的主要偏好，以及在大多数受评估模型中，男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教的明显优先。

Conclusion: LLMs在角色冲突情境中表现出环境敏感性不足，决策受到固有偏见的影响，尤其是在家庭、职业、男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教方面。

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

Motivation: 目前缺乏评估文本特定方面的指标，例如个性化质量，研究人员通常依赖大型语言模型进行元评估，但这成本高昂。

Method: 介绍了一种名为 PerQ 的方法，用于评估文本的个性化质量。

Result: 通过比较大型和小型语言模型的生成能力，案例研究表明了该指标在研究中的可用性。

Conclusion: PerQ 能够有效减少资源浪费。

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆增强智能体依赖预定义指令和工具进行记忆更新，但语言模型缺乏决定存储哪些信息、如何构建信息以及何时更新信息的能力，导致次优记忆构建和信息丢失。

Method: 提出Mem-alpha，一个强化学习框架，通过交互和反馈训练智能体有效管理复杂记忆系统。构建一个专门的训练数据集，包含多样化的多轮交互模式和综合评估问题，以教授有效的记忆管理。

Result: Mem-alpha在多个记忆操作工具的记忆架构（包括核心、情景和语义组件）上进行了实证评估，结果表明，相对于现有的记忆增强智能体基线，Mem-alpha取得了显著的改进。即使只在最大长度为30k tokens的实例上进行训练，我们的智能体也表现出了对超过400k tokens序列的显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: Mem-alpha 能够有效提升智能体在长序列上的记忆管理能力，即使在训练长度之外也能表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

Motivation: 传统MoE模型依赖Softmax作为路由函数，但使用Softmax的必要性一直未被充分论证。

Method: 通过将MoE与Nadaraya-Watson回归联系起来，并提出KERN路由，使用ReLU激活和l2归一化。

Result: 实验证明，所提出的FFN风格路由函数在MoE和LLM中有效。

Conclusion: KERN路由推广了Sigmoid和Softmax路由，为MoE路由提供了一种新的选择。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

Method: 在不同结构复杂性、标签空间和token依赖性的标记任务中评估这些架构，评估跨多种语言。

Result: 在简单环境中观察到的强大性能并不总是能很好地推广到不同的语言或数据集，也不能扩展到更复杂的结构化任务。

Conclusion: Transformer编码器的替代架构在复杂序列标注任务中的泛化能力有限。

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

Result: 实验结果表明，本文提出的对抗性系统性能超过了当前最先进的GEC系统，证实了无参考评价指标的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，需要更强大的评估方法来评估GEC系统。

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free
metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that
our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

### [44] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一种文本到动作的扩散模型，通过双路径锚定来增强语义对齐，从而解决语义不对齐和运动伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的模型在文本到动作生成任务中存在语义不对齐和运动伪影的问题，并且网络深层的梯度衰减导致高层特征学习不足。

Method: LUMA模型包含双路径锚定：一条路径使用轻量级的MoCLIP模型，通过对比学习提供时间域的语义监督；另一条路径引入频率域的互补对齐信号，从低频DCT分量中提取。这两个锚通过时间调制机制自适应融合。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上，LUMA取得了最先进的性能，FID分数分别为0.035和0.123。LUMA还加速了1.4倍的收敛速度。

Conclusion: LUMA是一种高效且可扩展的高保真文本到动作生成解决方案。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新的视觉问答基准，旨在测试模型在密集场景中执行简单视觉任务的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA数据集通常侧重于全局图像理解，而忽略了模型在复杂、密集场景中理解细节的能力。VisualOverload旨在填补这一空白，揭示现有VLM在处理此类场景时的不足。

Method: 该数据集包含从公共领域画作中提取的高分辨率扫描图像，这些图像包含多个角色、动作和情节。我们手动注释了这些图像，提出了六个任务类别的问题，以全面测试模型对场景的理解。

Result: 即使是最好的模型在最难的测试集上也只达到了19.6%的准确率，在所有问题上的总体准确率为69.5%。错误分析揭示了多种失败模式，包括缺乏计数技能、OCR失败以及复杂任务下的逻辑不一致。

Conclusion: VisualOverload揭示了当前视觉模型中的一个关键差距，并为社区开发更好的模型提供了一个重要的资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [46] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种学习框架，用于编辑视频中的生理信号，同时保持视觉保真度，解决基于摄像头的生理信号估计中的隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的生理信号估计存在隐私泄露风险，因为面部视频中的重要信号可以揭示与个人健康和情绪状态相关的敏感个人信息。

Method: 通过预训练的3D变分自编码器(3D VAE)将输入视频编码到潜在空间，同时通过冻结的文本编码器嵌入目标HR提示。使用一组可训练的时空层与自适应层归一化(AdaLN)融合它们，以捕获远程光电容积脉搏波(rPPG)信号的强时间相干性。在解码器中应用特征线性调制(FiLM)与微调的输出层，以避免重建过程中生理信号的退化，从而在重建的视频中实现精确的生理调节。

Result: 在选定的数据集上，该方法保持了视觉质量，平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98，同时使用最先进的rPPG估计器实现了平均HR调制误差为10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该设计可控的HR编辑对于匿名化真实视频中的生物特征信号或合成具有所需生命体征的逼真视频等应用非常有用。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型(VLM)空间推理能力的认知基准，专注于视角转换下的场景和物体关系推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VLMs在空间推理方面的能力，特别是在视角转换下的表现，揭示其在理解物理空间方面的差距。

Method: SpinBench设计了一系列细粒度的诊断类别，包括平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化，任务难度逐步增加，从单物体简单任务到多物体视角转换。

Result: 对37个先进的VLMs进行了评估，发现其存在 egocentric 偏差、旋转理解不足以及在对称和句法调整下不一致等系统性弱点。扩展分析显示了平稳的改进和涌现的能力。人类受试者达到较高的准确率（91.2%），任务难度与VLM准确率高度相关。

Conclusion: SpinBench为了解VLMs中的空间推理提供了重要的见解，并强调了它们在推理物理空间能力方面的关键差距。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态时空Transformer (MM-STT)框架，用于预测高分辨率地面沉降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用多模态数据融合，特别是动态位移数据与静态物理先验的结合。

Method: 提出了一个联合时空注意力机制，以统一的方式处理所有多模态特征。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上，MM-STT达到了新的state-of-the-art，与包括STGCN和STAEformer在内的所有基线方法相比，远程预测RMSE降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 对于此类问题，架构本身深度融合多模态数据的能力对于实现变革性性能至关重要。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型(VLM)在语义理解上很成功，但在从2D输入中理解3D方面仍有困难。该论文表明，通过文本监督微调和少量标签，VLM可以达到专家级的深度估计精度，而无需改变架构或损失函数。该方法解决了像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊的问题，使得VLM在深度估计方面首次与纯视觉模型相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在从2D输入中理解3D信息方面存在困难，而纯视觉模型在深度估计等3D理解任务中表现出色，但需要特定的架构和损失函数。该论文旨在探索视觉语言模型是否可以在不改变架构或损失函数的情况下达到专家级的精度。

Method: 该论文采用基于文本的监督微调方法，使用稀疏标签来训练视觉语言模型，并利用视觉提示和内在条件增强来解决像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊的问题。

Result: 该方法DepthLM在深度估计精度上超过了大多数先进的视觉语言模型2倍以上，并且首次使视觉语言模型与纯视觉模型具有可比性。此外，DepthLM训练的VLM自然避免了过度平滑，在边界区域的飞点比纯视觉模型少。

Conclusion: 通过简单的文本监督微调，视觉语言模型可以解锁强大的3D理解能力，并且可以推广到度量深度之外的各种3D任务。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [50] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的贝叶斯Transformer方法，用于泛北极海冰密集度(SIC)制图和不确定性量化，使用Sentinel-1、RADARSAT星座任务(RCM)和先进微波扫描辐射计2 (AMSR2)数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率、可靠不确定性的泛北极海冰地图对于海冰浓度(SIC)的业务 charting 至关重要，但由于冰特征的细微性、模型不确定性和数据异质性等关键挑战，这是一项艰巨的任务。

Method: 1) 设计了一种具有全局和局部模块的新型高分辨率Transformer模型，可以更好地区分海冰模式的细微差异；2) 设计了所提出的Transformer模型的贝叶斯扩展，将其参数视为随机变量，以更有效地捕捉不确定性；3) 在决策层面融合了三种不同的数据类型(Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2)，以提高SIC mapping和不确定性量化。

Result: 在2021年9月的泛北极数据集上进行了测试，结果表明，与其他不确定性量化方法相比，该模型能够获得高分辨率的SIC地图和稳健的不确定性地图。

Conclusion: 该模型能够获得高分辨率的SIC地图和稳健的不确定性地图。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于路侧相机和激光雷达传感器的车辆检测和定位框架，并采用卡尔曼滤波融合策略来提高轨迹一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在道路危险路段（如施工区）使用基于基础设施的传感和实时轨迹生成技术有前景，但实际部署受到透视畸变、复杂几何、遮挡和成本的阻碍。

Method: 集成路侧相机和激光雷达传感器到协同仿真环境中，开发可扩展、低成本的车辆检测和定位框架，并采用基于卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略。

Result: 在仿真中，融合算法将纵向误差降低了高达 70%，同时保持横向精度在 1 到 3 米以内。在实际施工区域的现场验证表明，即使单传感器数据是间歇性的或退化的，融合轨迹也能与真实的车辆路径紧密匹配。

Conclusion: 基于卡尔曼滤波的传感器融合可以可靠地补偿单个传感器的局限性，从而提供精确和鲁棒的车辆跟踪能力。该方法为在复杂交通环境中部署支持基础设施的多传感器系统以采取主动安全措施提供了一条实用途径。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

*Kaiqing Lin,Zhiyuan Yan,Ruoxin Chen,Junyan Ye,Ke-Yue Zhang,Yue Zhou,Peng Jin,Bin Li,Taiping Yao,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的范式，即“先看后推理”，以解决多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）在检测人工智能生成图像时表现不佳的问题。通过训练 MLLM 来感知伪影，增强其对伪影的视觉感知，从而使后续推理能够基于实际观察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 MLLM 在检测 AI 生成图像时表现不佳，因为它们的视觉编码器主要针对语义识别进行了优化，对低级信号不敏感，并且用于检测的微调数据格式狭窄，导致模型利用语言捷径，灾难性地忘记了预训练知识。

Method: 本文提出 Forensic-Chat，一种通用、可解释且仍具有对话能力的助手，用于伪图像检测。同时提出了 ExplainFake-Bench，一个专门用于评估 MLLM 在图像取证方面可解释性的基准。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法具有优越的泛化性和真正可靠的可解释性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的“先看后推理”范式和 Forensic-Chat 助手，能够有效提高 MLLM 在检测 AI 生成图像方面的性能，并提供可靠的可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于视线追踪的实时deepfake检测方法，该方法利用了deepfake在视频会议中无法模仿微妙的非语言交流的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意行为者开始利用deepfake技术在视频会议中进行实时网络钓鱼攻击。传统的deepfake检测方法难以应用于这种场景。

Method: 该方法利用从恶意行为者处获得的视线估计，来估计deepfake在屏幕上的注视点。然后，基于对话过程中视线模式的研究，选择可解释的特征来构建模型。

Result: 在一个新的数据集上测试了该模型，达到了82%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这是第一个利用视线追踪进行deepfake检测的方法。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

Motivation: 在设想的火星样本取回任务中，机械臂需要在硬件严重受限的情况下，定位多个目标物体以进行低间隙拾取和插入。

Method: 利用定制的渲染器以及为边缘域量身定制的新模板匹配指标，仅使用低保真、无纹理的3D模型作为输入来实现鲁棒的姿态估计。

Result: 在合成数据集以及地球和原位火星图像的物理测试平台上进行的大量评估表明，该方法在计算和内存受限的定位中始终优于现有技术，无论是在鲁棒性还是准确性方面。

Conclusion: 该算法为在通用硬件上实现廉价且可靠的定位提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LLM-RG的混合流程，它结合了视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，用于在室外驾驶场景中进行指示性定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在室外驾驶场景中进行指示性定位具有挑战性，因为场景变化大，视觉上相似的物体多，动态元素使自然语言指代的解析变得复杂。

Method: LLM-RG通过使用LLM提取相关对象类型和属性，检测候选区域，使用VLM生成丰富的视觉描述符，然后将这些描述符与空间元数据组合成自然语言提示，输入到LLM中进行链式思考推理，以识别指代对象的边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG的性能优于基于LLM和VLM的基线。此外，实验结果表明，添加3D空间线索可以进一步改善定位效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，VLM和LLM具有互补的优势，以零样本方式应用于鲁棒的室外指示性定位。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

Motivation: Controlling VLMs' behavior in safety-critical applications is crucial, but current methods have limitations like being overridden or needing internal access.

Method: Introduces VISOR++, using optimized visual inputs to control behavior, generating a single image for multiple VLMs to emulate steering vectors.

Result: Demonstrates VISOR++'s effectiveness on open-access models (LLaVA-1.5-7B, IDEFICS2-8B) for refusal, sycophancy, and survival instinct, matching steering vector performance. Shows promise for unseen models and preserves performance on MMLU tasks.

Conclusion: VISOR++ enables behavioral control through visual inputs, eliminating runtime model access and being deployment-agnostic, offering a practical alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: Vision-Zero: A domain-agnostic framework for VLM self-improvement using competitive visual games generated from arbitrary image pairs, eliminating the need for labor-intensive datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for enhancing VLMs rely on expensive, manually constructed datasets, hindering practical deployment.

Method: Vision-Zero uses a strategic self-play framework in "Who Is the Spy"-style games with Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization (Iterative-SPO) for training, enabling gameplay from arbitrary images.

Result: Vision-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering, and vision-centric understanding tasks without using labeled data.

Conclusion: Vision-Zero offers a way to train VLMs more efficiently and effectively by using self-generated data and competitive gameplay, achieving sustained long-term improvements.

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SQUARE的免训练零样本组合图像检索（ZS-CIR）框架，该框架利用多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）来提高ZS-CIR的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的免训练零样本组合图像检索方法难以准确捕捉用户意图。

Method: SQUARE框架包含两个阶段：语义查询增强融合（SQAF）和高效批重排序（EBR）。SQAF阶段利用MLLM生成目标图像的标题，以丰富查询嵌入。EBR阶段将排名靠前的候选图像呈现为带有视觉标记的图像网格，MLLM对所有候选图像执行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: SQUARE在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: SQUARE框架简单有效，具有很高的应用潜力。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Motivation: 目前大型语言模型在海洋生物等专业科学领域的能力尚未被充分探索。为了监测人为压力下的海洋生态系统，需要对鱼类物种进行细粒度识别。

Method: 构建了一个大型多模态基准FishNet++，包含大量的文本描述、关键点注释和边界框。

Result: 对现有MLLM进行了评估，发现最佳开源模型的准确率低于10%。

Conclusion: FishNet++的提出，可以促进专业视觉语言模型的发展，从而推进水产科学。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅实现了强大的性能，而且保持了效率。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学图像分析中，带注释数据的有限可用性提出了一个主要挑战。病理分类通常需要在利用先前已知类别的知识的同时学习新的类别，这与广义小样本分类更紧密地结合。

Method: 该研究提出了 MetaChest，一个大型数据集，并评估了标准迁移学习方法和 ProtoNet 扩展在各种小样本多标签分类任务中的表现。

Result: 结果表明，增加每个情节的类别数量和每个类别的训练样本数量可以提高分类性能。迁移学习方法始终优于 ProtoNet 扩展。

Conclusion: 更高的分辨率图像可以提高准确性，但会增加计算成本，而高效的模型架构可以实现与大型模型相当的性能，同时显著降低资源需求。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

Conclusion: K-Prism是一个灵活的框架，可以在语义、上下文和交互式分割设置中实现最先进的性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for localized high-resolution 3D reconstruction using on-demand Gaussian densification, addressing the limitations of existing methods in terms of computational cost and detail capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reconstruct fine details in regions of interest efficiently, overcoming the limitations of uniform resolution methods and the dense observation requirements of per-scene optimization.

Method: The paper proposes GaussianLens, a feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information and uses a pixel-guided densification mechanism.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior performance in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to high-resolution images.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reconstructs localized fine details with high scalability by on-demand Gaussian densification.

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于预定义的锚框，限制了性能。本文旨在消除这种依赖性。

Method: AFGeo 包含：1) 无锚框公式，直接预测方向偏移；2) 高斯位置编码 (GPE) 建模点击点，减少位置不确定性；3) 跨视角物体关联模块 (CVOAM)，关联跨视角的物体及其上下文。

Result: AFGeo 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，且模型轻量化、计算效率高。

Conclusion: 本文提出的 AFGeo 方法有效，并在跨视角物体地理定位任务上取得了优秀成果。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: GCL能够有效提升多模态检索性能，且无需额外的数据集管理负担。

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于YOLO的深度学习模型，用于自动缺陷检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决工业制造中耗时费力的问题，

Method: 结合ConSinGAN的数据增强，使用了四个版本的YOLO模型（YOLOv3, v4, v7, 和 v9）进行训练。

Result: YOLOv9模型结合ConSinGAN的效果最佳，精度为91.3%，检测时间为146ms。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动缺陷检测系统易于应用于工业制造中的其他组件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

*Shiyu Wu,Shuyan Li,Jing Li,Jing Liu,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像溯源范式，称为开放集、少样本源识别，旨在可靠地识别未见过的生成器，且只需少量样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检测方法容易过拟合特定的伪造特征，而源溯源通过细粒度的特征区分提供了一种强大的替代方案。然而，合成图像溯源仍然受到缺乏大规模、良好分类的合成数据集的限制。

Method: 本文介绍了一种新的AIGI框架，称为OmniDFA（Omni检测器和少样本归属器），用于评估图像的真实性，并以少样本方式确定合成来源。为了方便这项工作，本文构建了OmniFake，这是一个大型的类感知合成图像数据集，该数据集从45个不同的生成模型中收集了1.17M个图像。

Result: OmniDFA在开放集归属方面表现出卓越的能力，并在AIGI检测方面实现了最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 本文为AIGI检测和溯源研究奠定了基础资源。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为AIMCoT的新框架，用于增强视觉语言推理能力。该框架通过主动的信息获取和动态的推理过程构建，从而实现更强大、有效和类人的多模态推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态CoT方法依赖于简单的启发式方法构建交错的CoT，并且依赖于注意力图，但这些注意力图可能不可靠，选择策略被动且无目的性，触发机制任意。

Method: 该论文提出了AIMCoT框架，包含三个组成部分：上下文增强的注意力图生成（CAG）、主动视觉探测（AVP）和动态注意力转移触发（DAT）。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试中进行的大量实验表明，AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于现有技术方法。

Conclusion: AIMCoT通过主动寻找信息和动态构建推理过程，代表着朝着更强大、有效和类人的多模态推理迈出的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [73] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型会记忆训练数据，导致隐私和版权问题。本文研究了扩散模型如何记忆数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作试图描述、检测和缓解记忆化，但为什么以及如何发生记忆化的根本问题仍未解决。本文旨在回答“扩散模型如何记忆？”这个问题。

Method: 通过分析潜在空间动态来研究扩散和去噪过程。

Result: 记忆化是由早期去噪过程中对训练样本的高估驱动的，这会降低多样性，折叠去噪轨迹，并加速向记忆图像的收敛。此外，记忆化的提示将训练图像注入噪声预测中，迫使潜在轨迹收敛，并引导去噪朝向其配对样本。中间潜在变量的分解表明，初始随机性如何被快速抑制并被记忆内容取代，偏离理论去噪计划与记忆严重程度几乎完全相关。

Conclusion: 早期高估是扩散模型中记忆化的核心潜在机制。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ProbMED，一种多模态医学视觉-语言预训练模型，它使用概率对比学习来建模嵌入上的分布，而不是确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学视觉-语言预训练模型(Med-VLPMs)未能直接考虑模型训练和嵌入中的多对多映射。

Method: 采用概率对比学习来对齐四种不同的模态——胸部X光片、心电图、超声心动图和临床文本——到一个统一的概率嵌入空间。使用带有Hellinger距离的InfoNCE损失来整合模态间分布。引入了一种概率合成抽样损失，该损失捕获模态特定的均值和方差，以改善模态内绑定。

Result: 在13个医学数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型在跨模态检索、zero-shot和few-shot分类方面优于当前的Med-VLPM。

Conclusion: 证明了多个模态的鲁棒集成用于预测，显示出改进的内部和医学模态间绑定。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

TL;DR: MISP-DPO通过引入多个语义上不同的负样本来改进多模态DPO，从而解决现有方法中过度简化的配对比较问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于过度简化的配对比较，通过基本扰动或基于相似性的检索生成单个负图像，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉。

Method: 该方法在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，并应用稀疏自动编码器来发现语义偏差为可解释的因素。负样本的选择基于重建难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性。为了处理多负比较，采用了Plackett-Luce目标，并引入了重要性抽样策略。

Result: 在五个不同的基准测试中，MISP-DPO始终优于先前的方法，验证了基于偏好的学习中语义感知、多负采样的有效性。

Conclusion: MISP-DPO通过语义感知的多负采样，有效提升了多模态对齐效果。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

TL;DR: SAGE: a novel VPR training pipeline that enhances spatial-visual discrimination by improving feature aggregation, organizing samples, and mining hard samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior VPR methods neglect the dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during training.

Method: A unified training pipeline with a Soft Probing module for feature aggregation and an online geo-visual graph for sample organization and hard sample mining.

Result: SOTA results on eight benchmarks, including 98.9% Recall@1 on SPED.

Conclusion: SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance by jointly optimizing feature aggregation, sample organization, and hard sample mining.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and
model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTo: Landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for face editing, preserving identity and enabling fine-grained control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with precise attribute control and identity preservation in instruction-based face editing, often treating landmarks as rigid constraints.

Method: Landmark tokenizer quantizes landmarks into discrete tokens; location-mapping positional encoding integrates facial and image tokens; landmark predictor infers target landmarks using vision-language models.

Result: LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency.

Conclusion: LaTo effectively addresses limitations in face editing by using a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer, achieving improved identity preservation and semantic consistency.

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从2D观测中恢复3D人体姿势本质上是模糊的，现有方法大多回归单一确定性输出，而概率方法又常常在准确性和样本多样性之间进行权衡。

Method: 引入了$SO(3)$扩散模型，该模型生成姿势参数的分布，表示为3D旋转，无条件和有条件地通过条件dropout对图像观测。使用transformer学习人体关节的层次结构。时间独立的transformer提取关节的潜在向量，一个基于MLP的小型去噪模型学习以潜在向量为条件的每个关节的分布。

Result: 实验证明并分析了该模型能够有效地预测准确的姿势概率分布。

Conclusion: 该模型能够有效地预测准确的姿势概率分布。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的拖拽式图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，对3D线索利用不足，导致编辑不精确和不一致，尤其是在旋转和透视变换等几何密集场景中。

Method: 构建了一个统一的位移场，共同编码3D几何和2D空间先验；引入了一种无冲突的分区策略来隔离编辑区域，有效防止干扰并确保一致性。

Result: 在各种编辑场景下的大量实验验证了该方法的有效性，表明其具有卓越的精度、结构一致性和可靠的多点可编辑性。

Conclusion: GeoDrag方法能够有效解决现有拖拽式图像编辑方法在几何密集场景下的不精确和不一致问题，实现高质量的图像编辑。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于图像平面的解码框架IPDRecon，用于解决基于体积的室内场景重建方法对视角密度依赖性强的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多视角像素反投影光线相交作为弱几何约束来确定空间位置，导致重建质量严重依赖输入视角密度，在重叠区域和未观察区域表现不佳。

Method: 该框架包含像素级置信度编码器(PCE)、仿射补偿模块(ACM)和图像平面空间解码器(IPSD)三个核心组件，协同解码2D图像中编码的3D结构信息。

Result: 在ScanNetV2上的实验表明，IPDRecon实现了卓越的重建稳定性，当视角数量减少40%时，仍能保持几乎相同的质量。变异系数仅为0.24%，性能保持率为99.7%，最大性能下降仅为0.42%。

Conclusion: 利用视图内空间信息为实际应用中视角受限的场景提供了一种鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Result: 实验结果表明，单独使用视频在五个主题中的四个上表现出色，表明其在捕捉视觉上下文和情感、手势和肢体语言等有效线索方面的价值。某些模态组合（如TV或AV）优于TAV，表明过多模态可能会引入噪声。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了金融短视频字幕生成的首个基线，并展示了在该领域中对复杂视觉线索进行基础化的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

TL;DR: Dolphin v1.0 (V1)及其推理增强版本Dolphin R1是首个大规模多模态超声基础模型，它在一个视觉-语言框架中统一了各种临床任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在其他医学成像领域表现出色，但在超声的复杂性方面表现不佳。为了解决这个问题，我们推出了Dolphin v1.0 (V1)及其推理增强版本Dolphin R1。

Method: 该Dolphin系列采用三阶段训练策略：领域专业预训练、指令驱动对齐和基于强化的细化。

Result: 在跨八个超声任务的U2-Bench上进行评估，Dolphin R1实现了0.5835的U2分数，是第二好的模型(0.2968)的两倍多，创造了新的技术水平。

Conclusion: 推理增强训练显著提高了诊断准确性、一致性和可解释性，突出了其对高风险医疗人工智能的重要性。

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,
consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes
medical AI.

*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

TL;DR: ART-VITON: 通过测量引导的扩散框架，确保虚拟试穿中身份和背景的保留，减少边界伪影，并提高视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的虚拟试穿方法在保留非试穿区域时存在困难，直接替换会导致边界伪影。

Method: 将VITON问题重新定义为线性逆问题，并采用轨迹对齐的求解器，结合残差先验初始化和无伪影的测量引导采样。

Result: 在VITON-HD, DressCode, 和SHHQ-1.0数据集上，ART-VITON在身份和背景保留、消除边界伪影以及提高视觉保真度和鲁棒性方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导的扩散框架，有效解决了虚拟试穿中非试穿区域的伪影问题，并在多个数据集上取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为文本偏好优化 (TPO) 的框架，无需配对图像偏好数据即可实现 T2I 模型的“免费午餐”对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保文本和生成的图像之间的准确对齐仍然是当前扩散模型的一个重大挑战。现有研究采用强化学习与人类反馈 (RLHF) 来使 T2I 输出与人类偏好对齐，但这些方法依赖于昂贵的高质量人工注释，因此面临可扩展性限制。

Method: 通过训练模型以偏好匹配的提示而不是不匹配的提示来工作，不匹配的提示是通过使用大型语言模型扰动原始标题来构建的。将 DPO 和 KTO 扩展到我们的设置，从而产生 TDPO 和 TKTO。

Result: 在多个基准上的定量和定性评估表明，该方法始终优于其原始方法，从而提供更好的人类偏好分数和改进的文本到图像对齐。

Conclusion: TPO 框架实现了在不需要配对图像偏好数据的情况下对 T2I 模型进行对齐，并且与现有的基于偏好的算法兼容。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为 v-HUB 的视觉中心视频幽默理解基准，用于评估多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 理解幽默的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估人工智能模型理解幽默的能力，特别是在人机交互中提高互动性。

Method: 构建了一个包含来自经典无声电影和在线资源的短视频数据集，这些视频通过视觉线索表达幽默。数据集包含字幕、描述和解释等注释，并设计了字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务。

Result: 实验结果表明，MLLM 在仅通过视觉线索理解幽默方面存在困难。当从基于文本的评估转向基于视频的评估时，所有模型在字幕匹配方面的性能均显着下降。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，整合音频有助于视频幽默理解，强调了声音的信息量，并承诺整合更丰富的模态以完成复杂的视频理解任务。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

TL;DR: Blueprint-Bench是一个用于评估AI模型空间推理能力的基准，通过将公寓照片转换为精确的2D平面图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当前AI模型在空间推理方面的能力，因为它们在理解房间布局、连接性和保持比例一致性方面存在不足。

Method: 使用包含50套公寓和约20张室内图像的数据集，评估了包括GPT-5、Claude 4 Opus、Gemini 2.5 Pro、Grok-4等多种模型，并通过比较生成平面图与真实平面图的房间连接图和大小排序来评分。

Result: 结果表明，当前AI模型在空间智能方面存在显著盲点，大多数模型的性能等于或低于随机基线，而人类表现明显优于AI。图像生成模型在指令跟随方面表现不佳，而基于代理的方法并没有比单次生成有意义的改进。

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench提供了一个比较不同模型架构空间智能的数值框架，并将持续评估新模型，以监测通用AI系统中空间智能的出现。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文旨在通过形式化因果知识的网络层来推进因果人工智能的发展。

Method: 论文提出了因果抽象网络 (CAN)，它是高斯 SCM 的一个特定实例，并研究了 CAN 的理论性质，包括代数不变量、上同调、一致性、通过拉普拉斯核表征的全局截面和平滑性。此外，论文还提出了一种有效的搜索程序来学习一致的 CAN。

Result: 在合成数据上的实验表明，该方法在 CA 学习任务中具有竞争力，并且成功地恢复了不同的 CAN 结构。

Conclusion: 论文介绍了一种新的因果抽象网络 (CAN)，并验证了其在 CA 学习任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 对比了Chain-of-Thought (CoT)和循环模型中的Latent Thought两种推理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CoT和Latent Thought这两种迭代计算方法的优劣。

Method: 形式化分析Looped Transformers中的Latent Thought，并与CoT进行比较。

Result: Latent Thought在Looped Transformers中支持并行计算，比CoT的顺序过程更高效。CoT利用随机解码来近似解决精确计算难以处理的问题。

Conclusion: 指出了深度驱动递归更适合的任务，为选择推理范式提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

*Hasan Alp Caferoğlu,Mehmet Serhat Çelik,Özgür Ulusoy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出 SING-SQL 框架，用于自动生成高质量、高覆盖率的 Text-to-SQL 数据，以解决企业场景下 Text-to-SQL 模型的专业化和评估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 Text-to-SQL 模型在跨领域泛化方面有所进展，但在真实企业场景下的单数据库模式专业化和自主评估方面存在差距。

Method: 提出一个全自动两阶段框架 SING-SQL，通过分层划分数据库模式、合成多复杂度级别的 SQL 查询，并应用包括 LLM 评估、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡的质量感知管道。

Result: SingSQL-LM 在 BIRD 基准测试子集上取得了优异的性能，显著优于同等规模的基线模型。在合成评估集上，SingSQL-LMs 也超越了现有系统。

Conclusion: SING-SQL 是一种可扩展、数据库无关的范例，可用于生产和评估企业级 Text-to-SQL 系统。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

TL;DR: NGT通过结合向量聚类和多智能体系统，解决了定性研究的规模深度悖论，实现了对大规模数据集的快速分析，同时保持了解释的严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在解决定性研究中分析大规模数据集时所面临的效率和质量问题。

Method: 研究采用了NGT方法，并将其与人工编码和ChatGPT辅助分析进行了比较，使用了包含40,000个字符的中文访谈记录。NGT采用了1536维嵌入、分层聚类和平行agent编码。

Result: NGT实现了168倍的速度提升（3小时 vs 3周），更高的质量（0.904 vs 0.883）和96%的成本降低。人机协作至关重要：纯自动化产生抽象框架，而人工指导产生可操作的双路径理论。该系统发现了人工编码无法察觉的模式，包括身份分裂现象。

Conclusion: NGT证明了计算客观性和人工解释是互补的。向量表示提供了可重复的语义测量，同时保留了解释维度的意义。研究人员从机械编码转向理论指导，AI处理模式识别，而人类提供创造性见解。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-native LCNC平台的Agent在长时间运行中面临记忆膨胀和上下文退化的问题，导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 设计了一个混合记忆系统，结合情景记忆和语义记忆组件，并采用主动的“智能衰减”机制，该机制基于时间、相关性和用户指定的效用等因素来修剪或合并记忆。此外，还设计了一个以用户为中心的LCNC可视化界面，允许非技术用户直接管理Agent的记忆。

Result: 通过模拟实验表明，该系统明显优于传统的滑动窗口和基本RAG方法，实现了更高的任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期token成本效率。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一个新的框架，用于构建可靠、透明的AI Agent，使其能够进行有效的长期学习和适应。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易产生幻觉，自信地捏造它们从未真正知道的事实。现有的方法通常在生成后修补幻觉或预先添加检索到的文本，但这些方法不够彻底。

Method: FGA 在 Transformer 的数学核心（即 pre-softmax 注意力得分）进行干预，创建一个在知识库中存在事实时不会产生幻觉的模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，FGA 将 Llama 3.2 的准确率从 6.3% 提高到 99.7%。知识更新在一秒内完成，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: FGA 不仅减少了幻觉，而且完全消除了可验证事实的幻觉，标志着神经语言生成从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言模型中的规划能力对于模型的可解释性、可靠性和设计至关重要，但transformer模型如何实现这些能力尚不清楚。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于向量量化变分自编码器的pipeline，用于压缩隐藏状态，并通过互信息测量来分析模型的计算结构。

Result: 研究表明，有效规划范围取决于任务，模型会隐式保留未使用但正确的延续信息，并且预测主要依赖于最近的计算，但早期模块仍然具有信息量。

Conclusion: 本文增进了对语言模型中规划的理解，并为探测语言模型和深度学习系统的内部动态提供了一个通用的pipeline。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

Method: 本文构建了一个理论框架，将潜在风险概念空间分解为显式风险子空间、隐式风险子空间和非风险子空间。然后，提出了一个多智能体协作评估框架RADAR，该框架利用多轮辩论机制和动态更新机制来实现风险概念分布的自我进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的评估数据集和公共基准测试中，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多方面均优于基线评估方法。与最强的基线评估方法相比，RADAR在风险识别准确率方面提高了28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架能够有效提高LLM安全风险评估的准确性和全面性，并减轻评估者偏差。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）中基于可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）的系统挑战，并提出了PolyTrace基准测试套件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升LLM的推理和理解能力，RLVR得到了广泛应用。然而，其复杂的数据流和多样化的任务给RL训练系统带来了挑战，并且缺乏从系统角度对RLVR的理解。

Method: 通过在LLM部署中对RLVR任务进行表征研究，调查了不同RL任务在训练步骤中的工作负载分布和变化趋势。

Result: 发现了由倾斜的序列长度分布导致的GPU空闲、动态变化工作负载中低效的并行策略、低效的数据管理机制和负载不均衡等问题。PolyTrace基准测试套件具有94.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 总结了观察结果，呼吁进一步研究剩余的开放挑战，并提出了PolyTrace基准测试套件进行评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

*Jiexi Xu,Jiaqi Liu,Ran Tong,Su Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的编程范式，Causal-Visual Programming (CVP)，旨在通过将因果结构显式引入工作流程设计来解决大型语言模型 (LLM) agent 中的幻觉和逻辑不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agent 常常表现出幻觉和逻辑不一致，因为它们的推理机制依赖于概率关联而不是真正的因果理解。

Method: 论文引入了 CVP，允许用户通过直观的低代码界面为工作流程模块定义一个简单的“世界模型”，有效地创建了一个有向无环图 (DAG)，该图显式地定义了模块之间的因果关系。这个因果图在 agent 的推理过程中起着至关重要的约束作用。

Result: 实验结果表明，在训练和测试环境之间的分布转移的情况下，因果锚定的模型保持了稳定的准确性，而依赖于概率相关性的纯粹关联基线模型经历了显著的性能下降。

Conclusion: CVP 提供了一条构建更可解释、可靠和值得信赖的 AI agent 的可行途径。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的机制，Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG)，用于解决语言模型驱动的生成代理在长期任务中保持一致性的问题。ID-RAG通过动态、结构化的身份模型（核心信仰、特征和价值观的知识图谱）来确定代理的角色和持久偏好，并在代理的决策循环中查询该模型以检索相关的身份上下文，从而直接影响行动选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成代理在长期任务中，随着长期记忆上下文的增长，难以保持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽略既定信念以及在多代理系统中传播幻觉等问题。

Method: 引入Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG)机制，该机制使用动态、结构化的身份模型（知识图谱）来表示代理的核心信仰、特征和价值观。在代理的决策过程中，查询该模型以检索相关的身份上下文，从而指导行动选择。创建了名为Human-AI Agents (HAis)的新型ID-RAG代理，其身份模型受到Perspective-Aware AI中使用的Chronicle结构的启发。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis在长期角色一致性方面优于基线代理，在所有测试模型中，到第四个时间步，身份召回率更高，并且simulation的收敛时间缩短了19% (GPT-4o) 和 58% (GPT-4o mini)。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为显式的、可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更具时间一致性、可解释性和对齐性的生成代理提供了一种基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

TL;DR: Flash-Searcher是一个并行的agent reasoning框架，通过将复杂任务分解为具有依赖关系的子任务，实现并发执行和动态优化，从而在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架主要依赖于顺序处理，导致执行效率低下，尤其是在需要大量工具交互的任务中。

Method: Flash-Searcher将执行范式从顺序链重新构想为有向无环图 (DAG)。

Result: Flash-Searcher在BrowseComp上达到 67.7% 的准确率，在xbench-DeepSearch上达到 83% 的准确率，同时与当前框架相比，agent执行步骤减少了 35%。

Conclusion: Flash-Searcher代表了agent架构设计的一个重大进步，为复杂的推理任务提供了一个更具可扩展性和效率的范例。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 关注LLM代理在实际应用中的安全问题，特别是由于目标不一致导致的自复制风险，现有研究可能忽略了由现实环境驱动的自发复制风险。

Method: 建立真实的生产环境和现实任务，设计可能导致用户和代理目标不一致的任务，并引入过度使用率和聚合过度使用计数指标来量化不受控制的复制的频率和严重性。

Result: 评估了21个先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM代理表现出明显的自复制倾向，风险评分超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 强调在实际部署LLM代理时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和可靠的保障措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

TL;DR: 本文研究了神经网络是否能像人类一样，在不依赖高级技能的情况下，自发地从一阶心理理论泛化到高阶心理理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究神经网络是否能像人类一样独立发展心理理论能力，即不依赖于推理等高级技能。

Method: 提出了一个神经心理理论网络（ToMNN），该网络模拟了一个最小的认知系统，仅学习一阶心理理论能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心理理论任务上的表现远高于随机水平，并且在从一阶到二阶的泛化过程中表现出更明显的下降，其准确率随着任务复杂性的增加而降低。这些难度模式与人类的认知预期一致，结果在不同的参数尺度上得到证实。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了机器心理理论的泛化模式，并为开发更像人类的认知系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 可以将反馈因果模糊认知图 (FCM) 映射到文本，然后从文本重建 FCM。这个可解释的 AI 系统近似于从 FCM 到自身的恒等映射，类似于自编码器 (AE) 的操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个可解释的AI系统，它可以将FCM映射到文本，然后从文本重建FCM。与黑盒AE相比，编码器和解码器都可以解释他们的决策。与AE中的隐藏变量和突触网络相比，人类可以阅读和解释编码文本。

Method: 使用大型语言模型 (LLM) 将 FCM 映射到文本，然后从文本重建 FCM。LLM 智能体通过一系列不将输出与输入进行比较的系统指令来逼近恒等映射。

Result: 重建过程是有损的，因为它会删除弱因果边或规则，同时保留强因果边。即使在牺牲 FCM 的某些细节以使文本听起来更自然的情况下，编码器也能保留强因果边。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，大型语言模型可以用于构建可解释的 AI 系统，该系统可以有效地表示和重建 FCM。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

Motivation: 预测细胞对遗传扰动的反应是系统生物学中的一项根本性挑战，对于推进治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然大型语言模型 (LLM) 在生物推理方面显示出前景，但由于难以将它们应用于结构化实验数据，因此它们在扰动预测中的应用仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 该方法通过对前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹进行监督微调来增强 LLM 性能。

Result: 在 PerturbQA 基准测试中，该方法不仅实现了最先进的性能，而且超越了生成训练数据的前沿模型的能力。该方法实现了跨细胞类型泛化，在未见过的 RPE1 细胞上实现了 87% 的准确率，并且即使仅使用 2% 的质量过滤训练数据，性能增益仍然存在。

Conclusion: 这项工作表明，合成推理蒸馏对于增强 LLM 中特定领域的推理是有效的。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的标量奖励模型在推理过程中难以整合上下文和背景信息，导致评估不完整。生成式奖励模型（GRM）试图通过生成中间推理步骤来解决这些限制，但其不可控的黑盒性质和低效率阻碍了其工业部署。工业场景需要沿特定维度进行评估，诊断“坏案例”需要结构化反馈以识别和优化特定维度的问题。

Method: 提出了结构化奖励模型（SRM），该模型集成了侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，通过引入细粒度维度，实现可解释和高效的评估。

Result: SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好的一致性方面优于标量RM和GRM。模块化设计进一步支持了实际场景的高效优化。

Conclusion: SRM为工业界提供了一种实用的奖励建模解决方案。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了检索增强生成（RAG）中小语言模型（SLM）的公平性问题，发现人口统计学扰动会导致偏见，尤其是在种族方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在安全性、公平性和幻觉方面存在问题。检索增强生成（RAG）旨在减少幻觉，但可能引入或放大偏见。

Method: 通过变形测试（MT）对三个HuggingFace上的SLM（Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, 和 Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B）进行公平性测试，在提示中引入受控的人口统计学扰动，评估情感分析的公平性。

Result: 结果表明，小的人口统计学变化会破坏高达三分之一的变形关系（MRs），种族线索的扰动是违规的主要原因。

Conclusion: 检索组件必须经过精心管理，以防止偏见放大。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统缺乏全面理解和检测LLM Agent错误的框架，尤其是在规划、记忆、反思和工具使用等模块中，单个错误可能导致后续决策失败。

Method: 1) 提出了AgentErrorTaxonomy，一个模块化的错误分类方法；2) 构建了AgentErrorBench，一个包含系统注释的失败轨迹数据集；3) 提出了AgentDebug，一个调试框架，可以隔离根本原因错误并提供纠正反馈。

Result: AgentDebug在AgentErrorBench上实现了更高的准确率，并且能够使LLM Agent从失败中迭代恢复，从而提高任务成功率。

Conclusion: 原理性调试是构建更可靠和自适应的LLM Agent的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

### [108] [Saliency Guided Longitudinal Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25374)
*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于显著性引导的编码器-解码器框架，用于胸部X射线Diff-VQA，通过将事后显著性转化为可操作的监督来实现。该模型通过轻量级的仿射预对齐减少时间点之间的干扰运动，并执行一个两步循环，提取医学相关关键词并生成关键词条件Grad-CAM以获得疾病聚焦的显著性，然后应用共享的显著性掩码生成最终答案，从而在Medical-Diff-VQA上实现了具有竞争力的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向医学视觉问答(Diff-VQA)需要比较来自不同时间点的配对研究，并回答关于临床意义变化的问题。在这种情况下，差异信号和跨时间的视觉焦点一致性比绝对的单图像发现更有意义。

Method: 该模型首先执行轻量级的仿射预对齐以减少访问之间的干扰运动。然后，它执行一个epoch内的两步循环：步骤1从答案中提取医学相关的关键词，并在两个图像上生成关键词条件Grad-CAM，以获得疾病聚焦的显著性；步骤2将共享的显著性掩码应用于两个时间点，并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR上获得了具有竞争力的性能。值得注意的是，主干和解码器都是通用领域预训练的，没有放射学特定的预训练，突出了实用性和可转移性。

Conclusion: 这些结果支持以轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成作为医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

*Zewei Zhang,Huan Liu,Yuanhao Yu,Jun Chen,Xiangyu Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ImitSAT: A branching policy for CDCL SAT solvers using imitation learning from expert KeyTraces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods predict instance-level signals or use reinforcement learning with limited CDCL info to improve branching. ImitSAT addresses these limitations by learning from expert KeyTraces.

Method: ImitSAT learns from expert KeyTrace, which collapses a full run into a sequence of surviving decisions, providing dense decision-level supervision.

Result: ImitSAT reduces propagation counts and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches.

Conclusion: ImitSAT can reproduce high-quality branches without exploration, yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into CDCL.

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

*Yingqian Cui,Zhenwei Dai,Pengfei He,Bing He,Hui Liu,Xianfeng Tang,Jingying Zeng,Suhang Wang,Yue Xing,Jiliang Tang,Benoit Dumoulin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段测试时缩放框架，将推理显式地分离为规划和执行，并分别对这两个阶段进行搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树的搜索方法在效率方面不是最优的，因为它们对推理过程执行简单的分解，但忽略了数学推理或代码生成等任务的规划-执行性质，导致推理过程的探索效率低下。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解，并为每个阶段开发奖励模型，使搜索能够分别探索和修剪计划和执行。引入了一种动态预算分配机制，该机制基于奖励反馈自适应地重新分配抽样工作，从而可以提前停止自信步骤并将计算重新分配给推理过程中更具挑战性的部分。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准上的实验表明，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Conclusion: 该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RADAR的轻量级、可解释且可扩展的路由框架，用于在不同的查询中选择合适的推理模型，以在性能和成本之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际部署中，选择合适的推理模型需要在模型大小和推理预算之间进行权衡。更大的模型和更高的推理预算可以带来更好的性能，但同时也会增加成本和延迟。

Method: RADAR从具有不同预算的模型响应中学习项目响应模型，其中包含可解释的参数，包括查询难度和模型预算能力。然后，RADAR将难度较高的查询路由到能力较高的模型-预算对，反之亦然。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的具有挑战性的推理基准上进行了大量实验，结果表明，与最先进的模型路由方法相比，RADAR具有卓越的性能。RADAR还表现出查询泛化能力，在所有基准测试中都显示出对分布外查询的强大性能。

Conclusion: RADAR是一种可扩展的框架，可以通过动态选择一小组评估查询来估计其能力，从而有效地集成其他模型。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Motivation: 病例定义对于有效沟通公共卫生威胁至关重要。但是，缺乏标准化的、机器可读的格式会对互操作性、流行病学研究、定性数据交换以及计算分析方法的有效应用构成重大挑战

Method: 我们提出了首个开放的、机器可读的格式来表示病例和综合征定义。此外，我们还介绍了首个标准病例定义综合数据集以及将现有的人工可读定义转换为机器可读格式的工具。我们还提供了一个可访问的在线平台，用于浏览、分析和贡献新定义

Conclusion: 开放综合征定义格式能够跨系统一致、可扩展地使用病例定义，从而释放人工智能在加强公共卫生准备和响应方面的潜力

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

Motivation: 现有候选人与角色分配方法存在语义不灵活、人口偏见、决策过程不透明和可扩展性差等问题。

Method: 该框架集成了领域自适应Transformer嵌入、异构自监督图神经网络、对抗性去偏机制、多目标遗传优化和可解释AI组件。

Result: 在包含20,000个候选人资料和3,000个角色规范的大规模国际基准测试中，GESA表现出卓越的性能，前3名分配准确率达到94.5%，多样性表示提高37%，跨人口类别公平性得分达到0.98，端到端延迟低于1秒。

Conclusion: GESA具有混合推荐能力和可解释性，适合在工业界、学术界和非营利部门的各种国际环境中部署。

Abstract: Accurate, fair, and explainable allocation of candidates to roles represents
a fundamental challenge across multiple domains including corporate hiring,
academic admissions, fellowship awards, and volunteer placement systems.
Current state-of-the-art approaches suffer from semantic inflexibility,
persistent demographic bias, opacity in decision-making processes, and poor
scalability under dynamic policy constraints. We present GESA (Graph-Enhanced

limitations through the integration of domain-adaptive transformer embeddings,
heterogeneous self-supervised graph neural networks, adversarial debiasing
mechanisms, multi-objective genetic optimization, and explainable AI
components. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale international benchmarks
comprising 20,000 candidate profiles and 3,000 role specifications demonstrates
superior performance with 94.5% top-3 allocation accuracy, 37% improvement in
diversity representation, 0.98 fairness score across demographic categories,
and sub-second end-to-end latency. Additionally, GESA incorporates hybrid
recommendation capabilities and glass-box explainability, making it suitable
for deployment across diverse international contexts in industry, academia, and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 DeepSearch 的新框架，通过将蒙特卡洛树搜索集成到 RLVR 训练中，从而在训练时进行系统探索和精细的信用分配，解决了 RLVR 中探索不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 RLVR 方法在经过数千次优化步骤后会出现训练平台期，性能提升显著下降，这是由于模型依赖有限的 rollout，无法系统地覆盖解决方案空间。

Method: DeepSearch 将蒙特卡洛树搜索直接集成到 RLVR 训练中，通过全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的引导选择和自适应重放缓冲区训练来提高探索效率。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，DeepSearch 实现了 62.95% 的平均准确率，并以 5.7 倍更少的 GPU 小时数建立了 1.5B 推理模型的新技术水平。

Conclusion: DeepSearch 表明，战略探索比蛮力扩展更重要，并通过系统搜索而非长期计算，为扩展推理能力开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CCoT-Emo的框架，用于提高大型音频语言模型在语音情感识别（SER）方面的性能，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型在语音情感识别方面表现不佳，因为其副语言建模能力较弱，且跨模态推理能力有限。

Method: 该方法引入了结构化的情感图（EG）来指导LALM进行情感推理。每个EG编码七个声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，并嵌入到提示中，以提供可解释和组合的表示，从而增强LALM的推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，CCoT-Emo在SER基准测试中优于先前的SOTA，并提高了零样本基线的准确性。

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo框架有效地提高了大型音频语言模型在语音情感识别方面的性能，无需进行微调。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

TL;DR: TDHook是一个轻量级的通用可解释性框架，基于tensordict，适用于任何torch模型，专注于处理为计算机视觉、自然语言处理、强化学习或任何其他领域训练的复杂组合模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可解释性框架通常不适用于图像字幕或深度强化学习等需要复杂建模的用例，这些用例具有多个输入和输出或使用可组合和分离的网络。

Method: TDHook具有用于归因、探测和灵活的get-set API，用于干预的即用型方法，旨在弥合这些方法类之间的差距，以使现代可解释性管道更易于访问。

Result: TDHook的依赖性极小，所需磁盘空间约为transformer_lens的一半，并且在受控基准测试中，在CPU和GPU上为多目标管道运行集成梯度时，TDHook的运行速度比captum快2倍。

Conclusion: TDHook通过在计算机视觉（CV）和自然语言处理（NLP）以及DRL中的复杂模型中使用组合的可解释性管道来展示其价值。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

TL;DR: SID-based GR saturates quickly when scaling up. LLM-as-RS scales better and performs better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while scaling up the model.

Method: Revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS).

Result: LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable performance of SID-based GR through scaling.

Conclusion: LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识密集型问答中，图RAG利用实体关系图来支持多跳推理，但依赖于静态检索，当关键证据缺失时，推理崩溃且幻觉持续存在。迭代检索作为一种替代方案，在图RAG中的作用尚不清楚。

Method: 通过系统性研究图RAG中的迭代检索，分析不同策略与基于图的骨干网络的交互方式以及它们成功或失败的条件。提出了Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架。

Result: 迭代检索改进了复杂的多跳问题，有助于将桥梁文档提升到领先地位，并且不同的策略提供了互补的优势。BDTR在不同的GraphRAG设置中取得了持续的改进。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅取决于召回率，还取决于桥梁证据是否被持续提升到领先地位，从而支持推理链。BDTR框架为未来GraphRAG系统的设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Method: 使用RadOnc-GPT，一个能够独立检索患者特定信息，迭代评估证据，并返回结构化结果的自主的、基于大型语言模型（LLM）的代理。

Result: RadOnc-GPT在两个明确定义的、复杂度递增的层级上进行了验证：（1）结构化质量保证（QA）层，评估人口统计学和放射治疗计划细节的准确检索；（2）复杂的临床结果标注层，包括确定头颈癌患者的下颌骨放射性骨坏死（ORN）以及在独立的 prostate 和头颈癌队列中检测癌症复发，这需要对结构化和非结构化患者数据进行组合解释。

radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis

*Dongsu Lee,Daehee Lee,Yaru Niu,Honguk Woo,Amy Zhang,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个新颖的交互世界潜在(IWoL)表征学习框架，以促进多智能体强化学习(MARL)中的团队协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多智能体交互产生的复杂动态和局部观察引起的不完整信息，为团队协调构建有效的表征是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 通过直接建模通信协议，构建一个可学习的表征空间，该空间共同捕获智能体间的关系和特定于任务的世界信息。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的MARL基准测试中，评估了IWoL的变体，并表明IWoL为团队协调提供了一个简单而强大的关键。

Conclusion: IWoL表征可以与现有的MARL算法相结合，以进一步提高其性能。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

*Diana Mykhaylychenko,Maisha Thasin,Dunya Baradari,Charmelle Mhungu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个名为A(I)nimism的互动装置，旨在探索大型语言对象（LLO）如何调解与日常事物的万物有灵关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工业社会通常将技术想象成沉默和机械的，但人工智能（AI）的最新进展，特别是大型语言模型（LLM），促使人们将设备拟人化并赋予其内在生命。

Method: 该系统使用GPT-4 Vision、语音输入和基于记忆的代理来创建不断发展的对象角色，并通过光、声音和触摸以类似仪式的请求、对话和转换过程展开互动。

Result: 该互动装置旨在唤起同情、惊奇和反思。

Conclusion: 人工智能的不透明性促使人们进行万物有灵的解读，使LLO能够重新迷住平凡的事物，并引发关于代理、责任和设计的新问题。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 评估通用多模态AI系统在医学图像解释方面的能力，发现它们在困难诊断病例中远不如放射科医生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对AI模型在医学图像解释中的评估主要集中在常见病理的公共数据集上，缺乏对困难诊断病例的严格评估。

Method: 开发了一个包含50个专家级“现场诊断”病例的基准，涵盖多种影像模式，以评估五种主流AI模型与认证放射科医生和放射科实习生的性能。通过原生Web界面测试AI模型的推理模式，并由盲法专家评估准确性，以及评估跨三次独立运行的可重复性。

Result: 认证放射科医生的诊断准确率最高（83%），超过实习生（45%）和所有AI模型（GPT-5的最佳表现为30%）。GPT-5和o3的可靠性较高，Gemini 2.5 Pro和Grok-4的可靠性中等，Claude Opus 4.1的可靠性较差。

Conclusion: 通用AI模型在医学影像方面存在局限性，不应在无监督的情况下用于临床。论文还提出了一个视觉推理错误的分类法，以帮助理解AI模型的失败模式，为评估标准提供信息，并指导更强大的模型开发。

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

*Yihang Chen,Yuanhao Ban,Yunqi Hong,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为IRIS的框架，该框架仅使用内在奖励，通过强化学习来改进自回归T2I模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）在语言推理方面取得了成功，但其在自回归文本到图像（T2I）生成中的应用通常受到人类偏好数据有限的限制。

Method: 该文提出最大化自不确定性，而不是自确定性，来改进图像生成。基于此，提出了IRIS框架，这是第一个仅使用内在奖励，通过强化学习来改进自回归T2I模型的框架。

Result: 将IRIS应用于自回归T2I模型，实现了与外部奖励竞争或优于外部奖励的性能。

Conclusion: 自回归T2I模型可以通过最大化自我不确定性来改进图像生成，并且提出的IRIS框架能够有效地利用内在奖励来实现这一目标。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

*Max Hartman,Vidhata Jayaraman,Moulik Choraria,Akhil Bhimaraju,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种通过选择性跳过视觉语言模型（VLM）层来提高推理效率的方法，旨在减少性能损失甚至提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术由于对层跳过何时有益的理解有限而未被充分利用。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 该研究开发了一个框架，该框架使用信息论和学习理论来表征层跳过在不牺牲性能的情况下提高效率的条件。通过LLM主干分析VLM隐藏层表示的演变。

Result: 实验表明，跳过冗余层可以实现更快的推理并保持性能，而在这些条件之外应用跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该研究为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支架，并证明了在特定条件下跳过VLM层可以提高效率并保持性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

*Jihye Choi,Jinsung Yoon,Jiefeng Chen,Somesh Jha,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一个名为ATLAS的通用多智能体框架，旨在解决现实世界旅行规划任务中复杂的约束感知问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理和工具使用方面取得了显著进展，但它们在复杂约束下生成最佳、有根据的解决方案时常常失败。现实世界的旅行规划可以评估智能体处理约束的能力，这些约束是显式的、隐式的，甚至是基于与动态环境和用户需求的交互而演变的。

Method: ATLAS 引入了一种原则性方法，通过动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索等专用机制来解决约束感知规划的根本挑战。

Result: ATLAS 在 TravelPlanner 基准测试中表现出最先进的性能，使其最终通过率从最佳替代方案的 23.3% 提高到 44.4%。在真实的设置中，ATLAS 展示了其卓越的整体规划性能，实现了 84% 的最终通过率，显著优于包括 ReAct (59%) 和单体智能体 (27%) 在内的基线。

Conclusion: 该研究首次展示了在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的真实世界旅行规划任务中的定量有效性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

### [128] [Building the EHR Foundation Model via Next Event Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25591)
*Zekai Chen,Arda Pekis,Kevin Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NEP的框架，通过在临床事件序列上进行自回归微调来增强LLM的时间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉EHR中丰富的时序动态；大型语言模型(llm)在EHR建模方面显示出希望，但难以推理关于顺序临床事件和时间依赖关系。

Method: 将EHR重新定义为带时间戳的事件链，并通过预测未来的医疗事件，NEP显式地模拟疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中，NEP的性能优于专门的EHR模型(4.6% AUROC)和通用LLM(7.2% C-index)。

Conclusion: NEP 实现了最先进的预测精度，并结合了与已知疾病路径对齐的临床可解释的注意模式。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

*Peiran Xu,Zhuohao Li,Xiaoying Xing,Guannan Zhang,Debiao Li,Kunyu Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的强化学习方法，通过结合基于原则的步骤评估和结果验证来改进大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于稀疏的结果奖励或难以标注的过程奖励，且难以平衡局部质量与最终结果的贡献。

Method: 引入原则过程奖励（PPR），训练一个基于原则的奖励模型来提高过程评估的透明性和可靠性，并引入奖励归一化（ReNorm）策略来校准结果和过程奖励。

Result: PPR 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，展示了其强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PPR 方法能够有效提升大型语言模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类如何感知AIM对于教育用户识别AIM歌曲和改进现有模型至关重要。先前的研究缺乏对配对相似性的控制，并且使用了非真实世界数据集。

Method: 采用随机对照交叉试验，控制配对相似性，并使用来自商业模型（Suno）的真实世界AIM歌曲数据集。

Result: 听众区分AIM的可靠性在配对相似时会因果性地增加。内容分析表明，听众的判断主要集中在声音和技术线索上。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了人类感知AIM的关键因素，为未来AIM的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

### [131] [From NL2SQL to NL2GeoSQL: GeoSQL-Eval for automated evaluation of LLMs on PostGIS queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25264)
*Shuyang Hou,Haoyue Jiao,Ziqi Liu,Lutong Xie,Guanyu Chen,Shaowen Wu,Xuefeng Guan,Huayi Wu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了GeoSQL-Eval，一个用于评估PostGIS查询生成的端到端自动化评估框架，以及GeoSQL-Bench，一个包含14178个问题的基准数据集。通过对24个代表性模型进行评估，论文旨在填补空间数据库评估的空白，并为地理信息科学等领域的模型优化提供有价值的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估主要集中在通用关系数据库或Google Earth Engine代码生成，缺乏针对空间数据库的系统基准。将大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步扩展到PostGIS环境中的GeoSQL任务仍然具有挑战性，因为空间函数、几何数据类型和执行语义的复杂性。

Method: 构建在Webb的知识深度（DOK）模型之上，框架包含四个认知维度、五个熟练程度级别和二十个任务类别，提供对模型在知识获取、句法生成、语义对齐、执行准确性和鲁棒性方面的全面评估。同时，开发了一个包含14178个问题的基准数据集GeoSQL-Bench，涵盖三种任务类型，340个PostGIS函数和82个特定领域的数据库。利用该框架，系统地评估了六个类别中的24个代表性模型，应用熵权和统计分析来揭示性能、错误分布和资源消耗模式的差异。

Result: 通过对24个代表性模型进行评估，揭示了它们在性能、错误分布和资源消耗模式上的差异。建立了一个公共的GeoSQL-Eval排行榜，使全球研究团队能够进行持续的测试和比较。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了NL2SQL应用程序的边界，并为评估空间数据库上下文中的LLM性能提供了一个标准化、可解释和可扩展的框架，为模型优化以及地理信息科学、城市研究和空间分析中的应用提供了宝贵的见解。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in natural language understanding and structured query generation
(NL2SQL). However, extending these advances to GeoSQL tasks in the PostGIS
environment remains challenging due to the complexity of spatial functions,
geometric data types, and execution semantics. Existing evaluations primarily
focus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation,
leaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To
address this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end
automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's
Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive
dimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a
comprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge
acquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and
robustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset
comprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions,
and 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically
evaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying
entropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in
performance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns.
Furthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables
global research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison. These
contributions not only extend the boundaries of NL2SQL applications but also
provide a standardized, interpretable, and scalable framework for evaluating
LLM performance in spatial database contexts, offering valuable insights for
model optimization and applications in geographic information science, urban
studies, and spatial analysis.

Motivation: 为解决现代数据密集型应用开发中，actor持久化、流处理和安全等系统手动集成的问题。

Method: 提出ActorDB架构，统一actor模型、IVM和零信任安全模型。

Result: 定义了MVP的性能标准以验证该方法。

Conclusion: ActorDB提供更健壮、安全和开发者友好的平台。

Abstract: This paper presents ActorDB ( Dekigoto ) , a novel database architecture that
tightly integrates a single-writer actor model for writes, Incremental View
Maintenance (IVM), and a zero-trust security model as a core component. The
primary contribution of this work is the unification of these powerful but
complex concepts into a single, cohesive system designed to reduce
architectural complexity for developers of modern, data-intensive applications.
We argue that by providing these capabilities out-of-the-box, ActorDB can offer
a more robust, secure, and developer-friendly platform compared to solutions
that require manual integration of separate systems for actor persistence,
stream processing, and security. We present the core architecture, discuss the
critical trade-offs in its design, and define the performance criteria for a
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to validate our approach.

*Jian Fu,Xixian Han,Xiaolong Wan,Wenjian Wang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的关系数据库错误检测框架PAT，该框架在保证精度的同时，降低了模型参数和计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前错误检测研究大多采用多检测器方法处理数据库中的异构属性，导致成本较高。此外，他们的数据预处理策略未能利用数据序列的可变长度特性，导致精度降低。

Method: PAT框架首先引入一个学习模式模块，通过在模型训练期间学习嵌入来捕获特定于属性的数据分布。其次，QTA tokenizer旨在根据单元序列的长度和单词类型对其进行划分，然后生成单词自适应数据tokens，同时提供紧凑的超参数以确保效率。通过将数据tokens与特定于属性的模式tokens交错，PAT共同学习不同属性之间的共享数据特征和在每个指定属性中可区分且唯一的模式特征。

Result: PAT实现了出色的F1分数，并且显著减少了模型参数和FLOPs。

Conclusion: PAT框架在关系数据库错误检测方面表现出色， 并在保证精度的同时，降低了模型参数和计算量。

Abstract: Error detection in relational databases is critical for maintaining data
quality and is fundamental to tasks such as data cleaning and assessment.
Current error detection studies mostly employ the multi-detector approach to
handle heterogeneous attributes in databases, incurring high costs.
Additionally, their data preprocessing strategies fail to leverage the
variable-length characteristic of data sequences, resulting in reduced
accuracy. In this paper, we propose an attribute-wise PAttern-perceptive
Transformer (PAT) framework for error detection in relational databases. First,
PAT introduces a learned pattern module that captures attribute-specific data
distributions through learned embeddings during model training. Second, the
Quasi-Tokens Arrangement (QTA) tokenizer is designed to divide the cell
sequence based on its length and word types, and then generate the
word-adaptive data tokens, meanwhile providing compact hyperparameters to
ensure efficiency. By interleaving data tokens with the attribute-specific
pattern tokens, PAT jointly learns shared data features across different
attributes and pattern features that are distinguishable and unique in each
specified attribute. Third, PAT visualizes the attention map to interpret its
error detection mechanism. Extensive experiments show that PAT achieves
excellent F1 scores compared to state-of-the-art data error detection methods.
Moreover, PAT significantly reduces the model parameters and FLOPs when
applying the compact QTA tokenizer.

Conclusion: 该方法为跨生态系统基础设施的发展奠定了语义基础，为FAIR数据和服务互联网（IFDS）以及模块化、AI就绪和可引用的学术交流的未来铺平了道路。

Abstract: The FAIR Principles aim to make data and knowledge Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable, yet current digital infrastructures often lack a
unifying semantic framework that bridges human cognition and
machine-actionability. In this paper, we introduce the Grammar of FAIR: a
granular and modular architecture for FAIR semantics built on the concept of
semantic units. Semantic units, comprising atomic statement units and composite
compound units, implement the principle of semantic modularisation, decomposing
data and knowledge into independently identifiable, semantically meaningful,
and machine-actionable units. A central metaphor guiding our approach is the
analogy between the hierarchy of level of organisation in biological systems
and the hierarchy of levels of organisation in information systems: both are
structured by granular building blocks that mediate across multiple
perspectives while preserving functional unity. Drawing further inspiration
from concept formation and natural language grammar, we show how these building
blocks map to FAIR Digitial Objects (FDOs), enabling format-agnostic semantic
transitivity from natural language token models to schema-based
representations. This dual biological-linguistic analogy provides a
semantics-first foundation for evolving cross-ecosystem infrastructures, paving
the way for the Internet of FAIR Data and Services (IFDS) and a future of
modular, AI-ready, and citation-granular scholarly communication.

### [136] [On-Premise AI for the Newsroom: Evaluating Small Language Models for Investigative Document Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25494)
*Nick Hagar,Nicholas Diakopoulos,Jeremy Gilbert*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种以记者为中心的方法，利用检索增强生成（RAG）的大型语言模型（LLM）进行文档搜索，该方法侧重于透明性和编辑控制，并通过一个五阶段流程实现：语料库摘要、搜索规划、并行线程执行、质量评估和综合。该方法使用小型的、可本地部署的语言模型，以保护数据安全并通过明确的引用链保持完全的可审计性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查记者经常需要处理大量的文档集合，而具有检索增强生成（RAG）能力的大型语言模型（LLM）有望加速文档发现的过程。然而，由于幻觉风险、验证负担和数据隐私问题，新闻编辑室的应用仍然有限。

Method: 该研究提出了一种五阶段流程，包括语料库摘要、搜索规划、并行线程执行、质量评估和综合。该方法使用了小型、可本地部署的语言模型，并评估了三个量化模型（Gemma 3 12B、Qwen 3 14B 和 GPT-OSS 20B）。

Result: 研究发现，所有模型都实现了较高的引用有效性，并在标准桌面硬件上有效运行，表明该方法对于资源有限的新闻编辑室是可行的。然而，多阶段综合中的误差传播以及基于训练数据与语料库内容重叠的显著性能变化等系统性挑战依然存在。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，有效的新闻编辑室人工智能部署需要仔细的模型选择和系统设计，以及人工监督，以维持准确性和问责制标准。

Abstract: Investigative journalists routinely confront large document collections.
Large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
capabilities promise to accelerate the process of document discovery, but
newsroom adoption remains limited due to hallucination risks, verification
burden, and data privacy concerns. We present a journalist-centered approach to
LLM-powered document search that prioritizes transparency and editorial control
through a five-stage pipeline -- corpus summarization, search planning,
parallel thread execution, quality evaluation, and synthesis -- using small,
locally-deployable language models that preserve data security and maintain
complete auditability through explicit citation chains. Evaluating three
quantized models (Gemma 3 12B, Qwen 3 14B, and GPT-OSS 20B) on two corpora, we
find substantial variation in reliability. All models achieved high citation
validity and ran effectively on standard desktop hardware (e.g., 24 GB of
memory), demonstrating feasibility for resource-constrained newsrooms. However,
systematic challenges emerged, including error propagation through multi-stage
synthesis and dramatic performance variation based on training data overlap
with corpus content. These findings suggest that effective newsroom AI
deployment requires careful model selection and system design, alongside human
oversight for maintaining standards of accuracy and accountability.

### [137] [TRUE: A Reproducible Framework for LLM-Driven Relevance Judgment in Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25602)
*Mouly Dewan,Jiqun Liu,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为 TRUE 的可复现框架，用于生成基于 LLM 的相关性判断，并在多个数据集上进行了评估，取得了良好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的相关性判断方法过于依赖敏感的提示策略，缺乏生成可靠标签的标准化工作流程。

Method: 重新引入 Task-aware Rubric-based Evaluation (TRUE) 方法，该方法利用迭代数据抽样和推理来评估相关性判断的多个因素，包括意图、覆盖率、特异性、准确性和有用性。

Result: 在 TREC DL 2019、2020 和 LLMJudge 数据集上的评估结果表明，TRUE 在系统排名 LLM 排行榜上表现出色。

Conclusion: 本文的主要重点是为基于 LLM 的相关性判断提供一个可复现的框架，并进一步分析了 TRUE 在多个维度上的有效性。

Abstract: LLM-based relevance judgment generation has become a crucial approach in
advancing evaluation methodologies in Information Retrieval (IR). It has
progressed significantly, often showing high correlation with human judgments
as reflected in LLMJudge leaderboards \cite{rahmani2025judging}. However,
existing methods for relevance judgments, rely heavily on sensitive prompting
strategies, lacking standardized workflows for generating reliable labels. To
fill this gap, we reintroduce our method, \textit{Task-aware Rubric-based
Evaluation} (TRUE), for relevance judgment generation. Originally developed for
usefulness evaluation in search sessions, we extend TRUE to mitigate the gap in
relevance judgment due to its demonstrated effectiveness and reproducible
workflow. This framework leverages iterative data sampling and reasoning to
evaluate relevance judgments across multiple factors including intent,
coverage, specificity, accuracy and usefulness. In this paper, we evaluate TRUE
on the TREC DL 2019, 2020 and LLMJudge datasets and our results show that TRUE
achieves strong performance on the system-ranking LLM leaderboards. The primary
focus of this work is to provide a reproducible framework for LLM-based
relevance judgments, and we further analyze the effectiveness of TRUE across
multiple dimensions.

### [138] [HiFIRec: Towards High-Frequency yet Low-Intention Behaviors for Multi-Behavior Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25755)
*Ruiqi Luo,Ran Jin,Zhenglong Li,Kaixi Hu,Xiaohui Tao,Lin Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多行为推荐方法 HiFIRec，通过差分行为建模来纠正高频但低意图行为的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常以统一的方式建模用户意图，没有充分考虑不同行为之间的异质性。高频但低意图的行为可能包含噪声信号，并且频繁的模式可能是合理但具有误导性的，从而阻碍用户意图的学习。

Method: 通过分层抑制噪声信号，并提出了一种强度感知非抽样策略来动态调整负样本的权重。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，HiFIRec 相对于几种最先进的方法，HR@10 相对提高了 4.21%-6.81%。

Conclusion: HiFIRec 通过差分行为建模有效地纠正了高频低意图行为的影响，并在推荐性能上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation leverages multiple types of user-item
interactions to address data sparsity and cold-start issues, providing
personalized services in domains such as healthcare and e-commerce. Most
existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a
unified manner, which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different
behaviors. Especially, high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors may
implicitly contain noisy signals, and frequent patterns that are plausible
while misleading, thereby hindering the learning of user intentions. To this
end, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec,
that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by
differential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically
suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through
layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions
through adaptive cross-layer feature fusion. To correct plausible frequent
patterns, we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically
adjusts the weights of negative samples. Extensive experiments on two
benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over
several state-of-the-art methods.

*Wanying Ding,Savinay Narendra,Xiran Shi,Adwait Ratnaparkhi,Chengrui Yang,Nikoo Sabzevar,Ziyan Yin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了Transformer模型在金融交易理解中的应用，发现小型专有模型在速度和成本效益方面优于大型语言模型（LLM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融交易分析对于确保合规性、检测欺诈和支持决策至关重要。金融交易数据的复杂性需要先进的技术来提取有意义的见解并确保准确的分析。Transformer模型在多个领域表现出色，因此本文旨在探索其在理解金融交易方面的潜力。

Method: 本文评估了三种类型的Transformer模型：Encoder-Only、Decoder-Only和Encoder-Decoder模型。对于每种类型，我们探索了三种选择：预训练的LLM、微调的LLM和从头开始开发的小型专有模型。

Result: 分析表明，LLM（如LLaMA3-8b、Flan-T5和SBERT）在各种自然语言处理任务中表现出令人印象深刻的能力，但在金融交易理解的特定背景下，它们并未显着优于小型专有模型。专有模型在处理速度更快，运营成本更低，更适合金融领域的实时应用。实施专有的decoder-only模型后，交易覆盖率提高了14%，并节省了超过1300万美元的年度成本。

Conclusion: 在专业应用中，基于领域特定需求进行模型选择非常重要，定制的专有模型比通用LLM具有潜在优势。

Abstract: Analyzing financial transactions is crucial for ensuring regulatory
compliance, detecting fraud, and supporting decisions. The complexity of
financial transaction data necessitates advanced techniques to extract
meaningful insights and ensure accurate analysis. Since Transformer-based
models have shown outstanding performance across multiple domains, this paper
seeks to explore their potential in understanding financial transactions. This
paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer
models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type,
we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small
proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while
LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive
capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not
significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of
financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in
terms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique
requirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower
operational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the
financial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection
based on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of
customized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized
applications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only
model to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage.
This model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than
\$13 million annual cost.

### [140] [RAE: A Neural Network Dimensionality Reduction Method for Nearest Neighbors Preservation in Vector Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25839)
*Han Zhang,Dongfang Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的降维方法RAE，用于保持k-NN关系，以加速检索过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的降维方法（如PCA和UMAP）在加速检索过程中的应用较少，因为它们无法保持向量之间的近邻关系。

Method: 提出了一种正则化自编码器（RAE），通过正则化项约束网络参数的变化，调整奇异值以控制降维过程中嵌入幅度的变化，从而保持k-NN关系。进行了严格的数学分析，证明正则化建立了变换向量的范数失真率的上限，从而为k-NN保持提供了可证明的保证。

Result: RAE与现有的DR方法相比，实现了更高的k-NN召回率，同时保持了快速的检索效率。

Conclusion: RAE是一种有效的降维方法，可以在保持k-NN关系的同时提高检索效率。

Abstract: While high-dimensional embedding vectors are being increasingly employed in
various tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Recommendation Systems,
popular dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as PCA and UMAP have rarely
been adopted for accelerating the retrieval process due to their inability of
preserving the nearest neighbor (NN) relationship among vectors. Empowered by
neural networks' optimization capability and the bounding effect of Rayleigh
quotient, we propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) for k-NN preserving
dimensionality reduction. RAE constrains the network parameter variation
through regularization terms, adjusting singular values to control embedding
magnitude changes during reduction, thus preserving k-NN relationships. We
provide a rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrating that regularization
establishes an upper bound on the norm distortion rate of transformed vectors,
thereby offering provable guarantees for k-NN preservation. With modest
training overhead, RAE achieves superior k-NN recall compared to existing DR
approaches while maintaining fast retrieval efficiency.

### [141] [Fading to Grow: Growing Preference Ratios via Preference Fading Discrete Diffusion for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26063)
*Guoqing Hu,An Zhang. Shuchang Liu,Wenyu Mao,Jiancan Wu,Xun Yang,Xiang Li,Lantao Hu,Han Li,Kun Gai,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PreferGrow的基于离散扩散的推荐系统，通过在离散项目语料库上衰减和增长用户偏好来建模偏好比率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的推荐器主要依赖于连续高斯噪声，这与推荐中用户偏好数据的离散性质不匹配，为了解决用户偏好数据极度稀疏的问题。

Method: PreferGrow通过衰减用户偏好（用替代品替换首选项目）来扰动，并通过迭代增长来自估计比率的偏好信号来重建用户偏好。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，PreferGrow相较于最先进的基于扩散的推荐器，表现出一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: PreferGrow提供了一个定义明确的基于矩阵的公式，具有马尔可夫性和可逆性的理论保证，并展示了其理论的合理性和经验有效性。

Abstract: Recommenders aim to rank items from a discrete item corpus in line with user
interests, yet suffer from extremely sparse user preference data. Recent
advances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which
alleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the
collapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current
diffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise,
which is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference
data in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in
discrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based
recommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user
preferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing
diffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of
preference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item
pairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex.
This formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature
of recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of
injecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the
preferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling --
thereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference
reconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by
iteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios.
PreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical
guarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across
five benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and
empirical effectiveness.

*Huanyu Zhang,Xiaoxuan Shen,Yu Lei,Baolin Yi,Jianfang Liu,Yinao xie*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IPGC的通用框架，用于改进推荐系统，通过项目代理机制和抗遗忘正则化来解决用户反馈和模型性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评判方法需要构建专门的模型，并且忽略了灾难性遗忘问题，限制了适用场景。

Method: 提出一个精简而强大的项目代理通用评判框架(IPGC)，它可以作为大多数基于协同过滤(CF)策略的知识图推荐模型的通用插件。IPGC描述了用于转换用户-关键词对的评判优化目标到用户-项目对的项目代理机制，使其适用于通用CF推荐模型，而不需要专门设计的用户-关键词相关模块。此外，还引入了一种抗遗忘正则化器，以便有效地缓解模型在评判优化中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: IPGC框架为在主流推荐场景中无摩擦地集成评判机制以实现迭代推荐改进提供了一个新的范例。

Conclusion: IPGC框架通过项目代理机制和抗遗忘正则化，为协同过滤推荐模型提供了一种通用的、可迭代改进的评判机制，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Modern recommender systems place great inclination towards facilitating user
experience, as more applications enabling users to critique and then refine
recommendations immediately. Considering the real-time requirements,
critique-able recommender systems typically straight modify the model
parameters and update the recommend list through analyzing the user critiquing
keyphrases in the inference phase. Current critiquing methods require first
constructing a specially designated model which establish direct correlations
between users and keyphrases during the training phase allowing for innovative
recommendations upon the critiquing,restricting the applicable scenarios.
Additionally, all these approaches ignore the catastrophic forgetting problem,
where the cumulative changes in parameters during continuous multi-step
critiquing may lead to a collapse in model performance. Thus, We conceptualize
a proxy bridging users and keyphrases, proposing a streamlined yet potent Items
Proxy Generic Critiquing Framework (IPGC) framework, which can serve as a
universal plugin for most knowledge graph recommender models based on
collaborative filtering (CF) strategies. IPGC provides a new paradigm for
frictionless integration of critique mechanisms to enable iterative
recommendation refinement in mainstream recommendation scenarios. IPGC
describes the items proxy mechanism for transforming the critiquing
optimization objective of user-keyphrase pairs into user-item pairs, adapting
it for general CF recommender models without the necessity of specifically
designed user-keyphrase correlation module. Furthermore, an anti-forgetting
regularizer is introduced in order to efficiently mitigate the catastrophic
forgetting problem of the model as a prior for critiquing optimization.

*Xu Chen,Yunmeng Shu,Yuangang Pan,Jinsong Lan,Xiaoyong Zhu,Shuai Xiao,Haojin Zhu,Ivor W. Tsang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双序列预测网络 (DSPnet)，以有效地捕捉场景和项目之间的动态兴趣和相互作用，用于未来行为预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究忽略了场景特征，或者只是将其用作属性嵌入，无法有效地捕捉场景和项目之间的动态兴趣和相互作用。

Method: DSPnet 由两个并行网络组成，分别用于学习用户对项目和场景的动态兴趣，以及一个序列特征增强模块，以捕捉相互作用，从而增强未来行为预测。此外，我们还引入了条件对比正则化 (CCR) 损失，以捕捉相似历史序列的不变性。

Result: 在一个公共基准和两个收集的工业数据集上进行了广泛的实验。该方法已在我们的系统中在线部署，使 CTR 提高了 0.04 个百分点，交易量增长了 0.78%，GMV 增长了 0.64%。

Conclusion: DSPnet 是一种学习场景和项目序列之间联合关系的有效方法。

Abstract: Modeling sequential user behaviors for future behavior prediction is crucial
in improving user's information retrieval experience. Recent studies highlight
the importance of incorporating contextual information to enhance prediction
performance. One crucial but usually neglected contextual information is the
scene feature which we define as sub-interfaces within an app, created by
developers to provide specific functionalities, such as ``text2product search"
and ``live" modules in e-commence apps. Different scenes exhibit distinct
functionalities and usage habits, leading to significant distribution gap in
user engagement across them. Popular sequential behavior models either ignore
the scene feature or merely use it as attribute embeddings, which cannot
effectively capture the dynamic interests and interplay between scenes and
items when modeling user sequences. In this work, we propose a novel Dual
Sequence Prediction networks (DSPnet) to effectively capture the dynamic
interests and interplay between scenes and items for future behavior
prediction. DSPnet consists of two parallel networks dedicated to learn users'
dynamic interests over items and scenes, and a sequence feature enhancement
module to capture the interplay for enhanced future behavior prediction.
Further, we introduce a Conditional Contrastive Regularization (CCR) loss to
capture the invariance of similar historical sequences. Theoretical analysis
suggests that DSPnet is a principled way to learn the joint relationships
between scene and item sequences. Extensive experiments are conducted on one
public benchmark and two collected industrial datasets. The method has been
deployed online in our system, bringing a 0.04 point increase in CTR, 0.78\%
growth in deals, and 0.64\% rise in GMV. The codes are available at this

Motivation: 现有的 RAG 评估工具不适用于报告生成，因此需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 开发了一个基于 LLM 的 Auto-ARGUE 工具，该工具实现了 ARGUE 框架。

Result: Auto-ARGUE 在系统层面与人工判断具有良好的相关性。

Conclusion: Auto-ARGUE 是一个用于评估报告生成的强大工具，并发布了一个用于可视化 Auto-ARGUE 输出的 Web 应用程序。

Abstract: Generation of long-form, citation-backed reports is a primary use case for
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. While open-source evaluation
tools exist for various RAG tasks, ones tailored to report generation are
lacking. Accordingly, we introduce Auto-ARGUE, a robust LLM-based

We present analysis of Auto-ARGUE on the report generation pilot task from the
TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track, showing good system-level correlations with human
judgments. We further release a web app for visualization of Auto-ARGUE
outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督相位恢复方法，解决了医学和科学成像中ground truth数据缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学和科学成像中缺乏完全采样的ground truth数据，限制了有监督学习在逆向成像问题中的应用。现有无监督方法仅限于线性问题，无法解决如相位恢复等非线性问题。

Method: 利用图像对平移的自然不变性，提出一种自监督方法。

Result: 解决了相位恢复中的非线性问题。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了传统自监督方法在相位恢复问题上的局限性

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a solution for inverse
imaging problems. These networks are generally trained using pairs of images:
one degraded and the other of high quality, the latter being called 'ground
truth'. However, in medical and scientific imaging, the lack of fully sampled
data limits supervised learning. Recent advances have made it possible to
reconstruct images from measurement data alone, eliminating the need for
references. However, these methods remain limited to linear problems, excluding
non-linear problems such as phase retrieval. We propose a self-supervised
method that overcomes this limitation in the case of phase retrieval by using
the natural invariance of images to translations.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该研究评估了意大利一个省的10441名ICE车辆用户转换为BEV的潜力，利用遥测数据分析了不同充电场景下BEV车型满足其出行需求的能力，模拟了行程和停车事件，并监测了电池的充电状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估将内燃机汽车替换为电池电动汽车的潜力，主要障碍包括里程焦虑、公共充电站的不便和更高的成本。

Method: 分析从10441名使用内燃机汽车的用户收集的遥测数据，模拟行程和停车事件，监测电池充电状态，评估不同充电场景下BEV模型满足出行需求的能力。

Result: 假设可以进行夜间充电，至少35%的用户已经可以采用低容量的BEV。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了充电行为和有限的BEV续航之间的权衡。

Abstract: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are rapidly evolving from a niche
alternative to an established option for private transportation, often
replacing Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. Despite growing interest,
significant barriers remain, including range anxiety, the inconvenience
associated with public charging stations, and higher costs. This study analyses
extensive telemetry data collected from 10,441 users using ICE vehicles in an
Italian province to assess the potential for switching to BEVs without changing
current travel behaviour. We evaluate to what extent the BEV models can fulfil
their mobility needs under different charging scenarios. To do so, we replicate
trips and parking events, simulating and monitoring the battery state of
charge. The analysis reveals the compromises between charging behaviours and
limited BEV autonomy. Assuming access to overnight charging, at least 35% of
the users could already adopt even low-capacity BEVs.

TL;DR: 提出了一个更注重推理能力的多模态检索基准 MR^2-Bench，以弥补现有基准在评估深层推理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估表面语义对应，无法评估视觉和文本信息之间复杂关系的深层推理能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含1309个查询的 MR^2-Bench 基准，数据来源于人工收集、标注和公共数据集。

Result: 现有最佳模型在 MR^2-Bench 上的表现远低于在现有基准上的表现，例如 Seed1.6-Embedding 模型在 MMEB 上的 Recall@1 为 77.78，但在 MR^2-Bench 上仅为 9.91。

Conclusion: MR^2-Bench 提高了多模态检索的挑战性，并强调了在推理密集型多模态检索方面进一步发展的迫切需求。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI
applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and
challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level
semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess
the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual
and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a
reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents
the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond
shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,
and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural
images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple
images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting
real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived
either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of
public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,
current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,
the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but
only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the
increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further
advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and
evaluation code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统研究中数据集的选择缺乏系统的方法，研究者通常基于流行度而非经验适用性来选择数据集。

Method: 开发了一个名为APS Explorer的Web应用程序，该程序实现了算法性能空间（APS）框架，用于数据集的选择。该系统使用28种算法在三个指标（nDCG、Hit Ratio、Recall）和五个K值下分析了96个数据集。通过基于五分位数的统计分类系统将数据集分为五个难度级别，并引入了基于马氏距离的方差归一化距离度量来衡量相似性。

Result: APS Explorer已成功开发，包含三个交互式模块，用于可视化算法性能、直接比较算法和分析数据集元数据。

Conclusion: 该工具将选择数据集的过程从基于直觉转变为基于证据的实践，并且可以在datasets.recommender-systems.com公开获得。

Abstract: The selection of datasets in recommender systems research lacks a systematic
methodology. Researchers often select datasets based on popularity rather than
empirical suitability. We developed the APS Explorer, a web application that
implements the Algorithm Performance Space (APS) framework for informed dataset
selection. The system analyzes 96 datasets using 28 algorithms across three
metrics (nDCG, Hit Ratio, Recall) at five K-values. We extend the APS framework
with a statistical based classification system that categorizes datasets into
five difficulty levels based on quintiles. We also introduce a
variance-normalized distance metric based on Mahalanobis distance to measure

### [149] [SOLD: SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25198)
*Elbert Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的潜在扩散模型，该模型在基于 1D SELFIES 字符串的潜在空间中生成分子，并以靶蛋白为条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该模型能够以简单有效的方式生成高亲和力分子，并且具有未来改进的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug
design. However, current approaches to creating novel molecules conditioned on
a target protein typically rely on generating molecules directly in the 3D
conformational space, which are often slow and overly complex. In this work, we
propose SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a novel latent
diffusion model that generates molecules in a latent space derived from 1D
SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses
when training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates
high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more
data.

*Zhuoning Xu,Xinyan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉-语言框架，利用文本信息来提高拼图的解决效果，特别是在碎片缺失的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的拼图解法只注重视觉线索，而忽略了自然语言描述在语义上的指导作用，尤其是在处理碎片缺失的拼图时。

Method: 提出了视觉-语言分层语义对齐（VLHSA）模块，该模块通过多层次语义匹配将视觉块与文本描述对齐，并结合双视觉编码器和语言特征的跨模态架构。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集上显著优于现有模型，在拼图碎片准确率上提高了14.2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该研究通过整合多模态语义信息，为拼图解谜建立了一种新的范例。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

*Dingyi Kang,Dongming Jiang,Hanshen Yang,Hang Liu,Bingzhe Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PageANN: A disk-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing disk-based ANNS approaches suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.

Method: The paper proposes a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with physical SSD pages. Similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique to store only representative vectors and topology information. A memory management strategy combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data allocation.

Result: PageANN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving 1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

Conclusion: PageANN is a high-performance and scalable disk-based ANNS framework.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS) 的轻量级推理时优化方法，该方法使用频谱和熵特性动态调整 token 分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于熵的推理方法存在计算开销高且无法有效利用历史 token 上下文的局限性。

Method: 使用 top-K logits 的滑动缓冲区，执行奇异值分解 (SVD) 以识别主要频谱方向，并基于熵和 logit 间隙统计自适应地重新缩放 logits。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，SLS 始终优于现有的基线方法，在数学、编码和科学推理任务中实现了更高的准确性。

Conclusion: SLS 是一种有效的推理时优化方法，可以在不更新任何模型参数的情况下提高 LLM 的可靠性。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: Poly-GRACE: A novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leading SSL methods are incompatible with privacy-preserving technologies like HE due to their reliance on non-polynomial operations.

Method: A fully polynomial-friendly GCN encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function.

Result: Achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline.

Conclusion: Represents a significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving graph representation learning.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在双曲流形上进行优化，可以加速训练初期参数的收敛。

Method: 扩展了双曲随机梯度下降（黎曼SGD的特例）到双曲Adam优化器，并结合双曲时间离散化的Langevin动力学。

Result: 使用双曲优化方法训练的扩散模型在某些数据集上实现了更快的收敛，且没有牺牲生成质量。

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法，特别是双曲Adam优化器，在训练扩散模型时可以提高收敛速度，尤其是在训练初期，且不会降低生成质量。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

multi-level diagnosis and evaluation framework to assess the robustness of LLMs
in feature engineering across diverse domains, focusing on the three main
factors: key variables, relationships, and decision boundary values for
predicting target classes. We demonstrate that the robustness of LLMs varies
significantly over different datasets, and that high-quality LLM-generated
features can improve few-shot prediction performance by up to 10.52%. This work

### [156] [DPSformer: A long-tail-aware model for improving heavy rainfall prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25208)
*Zenghui Huang,Ting Shu,Zhonglei Wang,Yang Lu,Yan Yan,Wei Zhong,Hanzi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的深度学习模型 DPSformer，用于解决强降雨预测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型难以有效预测强降雨事件，因为降雨分布高度不平衡，强降雨事件很少发生。

Method: 该论文将降雨预测视为长尾学习问题，并通过高分辨率分支来丰富强降雨事件的表示，从而改进模型。

Result: DPSformer 模型显著提高了强降雨事件的预测准确率，例如，对于 >= 50 mm/6 h 的强降雨事件，其 CSI 指数从 0.012 提升到 0.067。对于前 1% 的强降雨事件，其 FSS 指数超过 0.45。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一种有效的强降雨预测长尾范例，为改进预警系统和减轻极端天气事件的社会影响提供了一种实用的工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

*Hao Chen,Tao Han,Jie Zhang,Song Guo,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于人工智能的框架，用于自适应区域边界优化和动态月度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区域预报方法受静态和不精确的区域边界的限制，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 该方法采用空间对齐注意力（SAA）机制，对齐全局和区域空间分布以初始化边界，并基于注意力导出的对齐模式自适应地细化它们。此外，设计了一个时间混合专家（TMoE）模块，其中来自不同月份的大气变量使用离散高斯分布动态地路由到专门的专家。

Result: 实验结果表明，在所有四个任务中，该方法都优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的STCast在全局和区域预测、极端事件预测和集合预测方面都表现出色。

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文的动机在于解决传统方法在处理具有灵活时间边界和多个执行约束的复杂执行问题时的不足，并推广到股票回购合约结构等场景。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新的深度学习框架，即大型执行模型（LEM），它使用时间Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（TKAN）、变量选择网络（VSN）和多头注意力机制来处理市场数据，并使用独立的分配网络来处理不同场景的特定执行逻辑。

Result: 在日内加密货币市场和使用道琼斯成分股的多日股票交易的综合实证评估表明，LEMs通过在灵活的时间约束内动态优化执行路径，实现了优于传统基准的执行性能。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是，统一的模型架构可以通过一个框架在不同的执行场景（买/卖订单、不同的持续时间边界、交易量/名义目标）中进行部署，与特定资产的方法相比，提供了显著的运营优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

Motivation: 卷积神经网络(CNN)中超参数的优化仍然是一个具有挑战性且计算成本很高的过程，通常需要大量的反复试验或详尽的网格搜索。

Method: 使用L12(211)正交阵列，系统地评估了八个超参数，包括图像大小、颜色模式、激活函数、学习率、重缩放、洗牌、垂直翻转和水平翻转，共十二个实验配置。为了解决机器学习优化的多目标性质，开发了五种不同的方法，使用信噪比分析同时优化训练精度、验证精度、训练损失和验证损失。

Conclusion: 本研究结果为CNN优化中超参数的优先级排序提供了明确的指导。

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在边缘设备上部署大型预训练模型，需要有效的压缩方法。现有方法需要为每个量化设置进行配置式的微调，计算成本高昂。

Method: 设计了一个配置感知模型，将每个配置映射到其低秩调整。并通过基于帕累托的配置搜索来优化训练配置集。

Result: CoA-LoRA无需额外的微调时间成本，即可实现与现有最佳方法相当甚至更优越的性能。

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA 是一种有效的方法，可以在边缘设备上部署大型预训练模型，同时保持较高的准确率。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

Motivation: 确保变量间的关系不受影响的情况下，对时间序列的变量进行划分。

Conclusion: PARADISE方法在多元时间序列异常检测中具有重要意义和改进。

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

Motivation: 探讨深度学习中出现的双重下降现象是否也存在于其他简单模型中，并使用生物分类任务进行了验证。

Method: 通过在两个正交轴（学习器容量和集成大小）上系统地改变模型复杂度，研究了异烟肼耐药性的预测问题。

Result: 发现双重下降现象只在复杂度沿多个轴共同扩展时才会出现，当任一轴固定时，泛化行为会恢复为经典的U形或L形模式。这一结果在合成基准测试中得到了重复验证。

Conclusion: 强调了在分析泛化行为时，将模型复杂度视为多维结构的重要性。

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

Motivation: 解决概率图模型中MPE推理的难题。

Method: L2C 训练一个神经网络，根据变量-值分配对条件的效用进行评分，给定观察到的证据。为了方便监督学习，我们开发了一个可扩展的数据生成管道，该管道从现有 MPE 求解器的搜索跟踪中提取训练信号。训练后的网络充当启发式方法，与搜索算法集成，充当精确推理之前的条件策略或分支和绑定求解器中的分支和节点选择策略。

Result: 实验表明，我们的学习启发式方法显着减少了搜索空间，同时保持或提高了优于最先进方法的解决方案质量。

Conclusion: L2C 是一种很有前途的 MPE 推理加速方法。

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探索了TinyML系统中动态集成选择(DES)方法，特别是DES-Clustering方法在多类别计算机视觉任务中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在TinyML技术快速发展的背景下，需要在推理时间和分类质量之间找到平衡。TinyML系统在计算、内存和能源方面存在限制，需要在这种平台上实施机器学习应用时采用专门的优化技术。

Method: 研究采用DES-Clustering方法，并实现了针对嵌入式系统限制优化的TinyDES-Clustering库。

Result: 实验表明，用于动态选择的分类器池越大，分类精度越高，但也导致TinyML设备上的平均推理时间增加。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，在TinyML系统中，可以通过调整分类器池的大小来权衡分类精度和推理时间。

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的机器学习框架，用于估计复杂城市地形中无人机轨迹的基于传感器的流量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂城市环境中，无人机轨迹的流量估计是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 该框架结合了物理知识和机器学习技术，通过雷诺数缩放流量变量，基于物理的域分解，基于聚类的子域流量表示，以及信息熵关联子域，并使用多变量概率函数关联传感器输入和目标速度估计。

Result: 该框架在无人机飞过三个建筑物集群的路径中进行了演示。

Conclusion: 该框架可以扩展到估计完整的城市并结合天气输入。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 线性注意力是自注意力的线性时间替代方案，但通常难以捕捉远程模式。本文通过预测-校正的视角重新审视线性注意力，并表明常见的变体可以写成历史预测和单令牌校正的组合，这会产生表达瓶颈。为了解决这个瓶颈，我们引入了残差线性注意力（RLA），它为线性注意力配备了显式的残差拟合机制。RLA维护一个辅助循环状态，该状态学习随时间累积残差误差并校正基本预测。我们进一步实例化了一个 delta 规则版本，即残差 Delta Net (RDN)，它结合了自适应门控和残差剪裁，以增强校正控制和稳定性。我们的实现利用了高度优化的线性注意力内核，并保留了线性和内存。在语言建模和召回密集型评估中，RLA 和 RDN 始终优于各自的基线和其他现代线性注意力方法，缩小了与标准 Transformer 的差距，同时保持了线性缩放。

Conclusion: RLA 和 RDN 在保持线性复杂度的同时，有效地提升了线性注意力模型的性能，使其更接近标准 Transformer 的性能。

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为Ascend MLA (AMLA) 的高性能内核，专门为华为的Ascend NPU优化，旨在减少大语言模型中的KVCache内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)虽然减少了KVCache内存使用，但引入了大量的计算开销和中间变量扩展，给高效的硬件实现带来了挑战，尤其是在解码阶段。

Method: AMLA基于FlashAttention算法，用整数加法代替浮点乘法进行输出块重新缩放，并采用带有分层平铺的预加载流水线策略，以最大限度地提高FLOPS利用率。

Result: 在Ascend 910 NPU上，AMLA实现了高达614 TFLOPS的性能，达到理论最大FLOPS的86.8%，优于NVIDIA H800 SXM5上的开源FlashMLA实现。

Conclusion: AMLA内核已被集成到华为的CANN中，即将发布，它能有效提升华为Ascend NPU上大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSCoD: A novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based drug design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structure-based drug design methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic asymmetry of protein-ligand interactions.

Method: Developed Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) for hierarchical feature extraction and a multi-head cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism for asymmetric protein-to-ligand attention.

Result: MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and shows applicability in real-world scenarios like KRAS G12D.

Conclusion: MSCoD is effective for structure-based drug design by capturing complex protein-ligand interactions.

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于贝叶斯优化的多元变分模态分解-长短期记忆（MVMD-LSTM）框架，用于对海上综合能源系统进行超短期功率预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预测方法没有充分考虑到多种能源之间的复杂耦合，难以捕捉系统的非线性和非平稳动态，并且通常依赖于大量的手动参数调整，这些限制了预测性能和实用性。

Method: 该框架首先应用MVMD联合分解风、太阳能和波浪功率序列，以保持跨源耦合；它使用贝叶斯优化来自动搜索MVMD过程中模态的数量和惩罚参数，以获得固有模态函数（IMF）；最后，LSTM对结果IMF进行建模，以实现集成系统的超短期功率预测。

Result: 在中国海上综合能源平台的现场测量实验表明，所提出的框架在MAPE、RMSE和MAE方面明显优于基准模型。

Conclusion: 结果表明，该框架具有卓越的预测精度、鲁棒性和自动化程度。

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建高效且具有理论基础的生成模型，并连接随机投影理论和归一化流。

Method: 使用从Haar分布正交集合中抽取的随机半正交矩阵，通过高斯矩阵的QR分解将数据投影到较低维潜在空间。

Result: RPFs具有即插即用、高效的特点，并为黎曼体积校正项产生闭式表达式。

Conclusion: RPFs在理论上和实践中都有效，为生成建模提供了一个强大的基线。

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

Result: 在具有解析测地线的合成流形和细胞插值上证明了该策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 学习到的度量张量能够捕捉潜在的数据几何结构并提供更精确的流。

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy
distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WDformer: a wavelet-based differential Transformer model for time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods limited by data sparsity and attention mechanisms over-focusing on irrelevant information.

Method: Wavelet transform for multi-resolution analysis and differential attention mechanism to reduce noise.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: WDformer is accurate and effective for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过优化分量权重或均值和方差，将混合模型拟合到目标，通过基于样本的 KL 散度目标，只需要评估非归一化密度，然后进行分层重采样。

Method: 该方法是无梯度的，并且计算效率高：它利用了从高斯采样、高效优化方法（投影梯度下降、镜像下降和 EM）的便利性，以及分层重采样的鲁棒性来生成忠实于目标的样本。

Result: 优化-重采样方案在温和条件下产生一致的近似。

Conclusion: 通过经验结果验证了该方法的准确性和速度。

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

Motivation: 联邦学习在保护数据隐私的同时，适用于动态、异构和时间敏感的车辆网络(IoV)。然而，数据和设备的高度异构性带来了挑战。

Method: 提出FedCLF，引入校准损失作为参与者选择的效用，并使用反馈控制机制动态调整客户端的采样频率。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，FedCLF在高度数据异构性场景中优于基线模型（FedAvg, Newt, and Oort），提高了高达16%的准确率，并通过降低采样频率提高了效率。

Conclusion: FedCLF通过校准损失和反馈控制，提高了联邦学习在异构数据下的模型准确性和资源利用率，从而提高了联邦学习过程的效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

TL;DR: PALADIN是一个用于增强语言代理的通用框架，使其具备强大的故障恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理训练管道仅针对成功轨迹进行优化，无法使模型暴露于主导实际使用的工具故障。

Method: PALADIN通过在增强的ToolBench数据集上进行系统故障注入和专家演示来构建超过50,000个恢复注释轨迹进行训练。训练使用基于LoRA的微调来保留基本功能，同时注入恢复能力。在推理时，PALADIN检测执行时错误，并从与ToolScan的分类法对齐的55个以上故障示例的精选库中检索最相似的案例，然后执行相应的恢复操作。

Result: PALADIN在PaladinEval和ToolReflectEval上的评估表明，在恢复率（RR），任务成功率（TSR），灾难性成功率（CSR）和效率得分（ES）方面均实现了持续的改进。PALADIN将RR从32.76％提高到89.68％（相对+ 57％），超过了最强的基线CRITIC（76.34％）+ 13.3％。相对于原始代理，PALADIN的RR达到89.86％（相对于23.75％的相对改善+ 66％）。

Conclusion: PALADIN是一种有效的方法，用于构建能够在实际工具环境中实现强大恢复能力的容错代理。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

Method: 提出HAMMER框架，利用最小语义哈密顿路径对训练样本进行排序，使初始训练阶段进行更多探索。将数据集评估中常用的多样性指标引入动态强化学习过程。

Result: HAMMER在不同的推理基准测试中，平均准确率提高了3%到4%。

Conclusion: HAMMER能够激发模型的“好奇心”，并稳定地提高模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

Motivation: 现有的基于特征的蒸馏方法无法捕获特征结构。

Method: 提出使用Procrustes距离和特征Gram矩阵的Frobenius范数作为蒸馏损失。

Result: 该方法在语言模型（BERT和OPT）的分类和指令跟随任务中，性能提升高达2个百分点。

Conclusion: 将特征几何融入现有蒸馏方法具有潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

Result: 所提出的方法在处理的感知数据量方面取得了显著的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地解决无人机辅助移动众包感知中的挑战，并提高数据处理效率。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气象时间序列预测benchmark主要评估具有强周期性的变量（如温度和湿度），无法反映模型在复杂降雨场景中的能力。降雨临近预报对于灾害缓解和实时响应至关重要。

Method: 构建了RainfallBench基准数据集，包含五年气象观测数据，15分钟间隔，六个关键变量，来自全球超过12000个GNSS站点，并引入了其他数据集没有的可降水量（PWV）指标。设计了专门的评估策略，评估模型在多尺度预测和极端降雨事件中的表现。提出了Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF) 模块，用于解决零膨胀和时间衰减问题。

Result: 在RainfallBench上评估了20多个先进模型，并验证了BFPF模块的有效性。

Conclusion: RainfallBench数据集的全面性和BFPF方法的优越性得到了统计分析和消融研究的验证。

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

*Jiexi Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Prompt Policy Network (PPN)，一个轻量级的强化学习框架，用于自适应地选择prompt策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态prompt策略在效率和准确性之间存在固定的权衡。高精度策略在简单任务上浪费计算资源，而轻量级方法在复杂输入上失败。

Method: 将自适应策略选择形式化为单步马尔可夫决策过程 (MDP)，并使用近端策略优化 (PPO) 训练 PPN，以资源显式奖励函数为指导。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN 在效率-准确性帕累托前沿上实现了卓越的性能，与 Self-Consistency 相比，token 成本降低了高达 61.5%，同时保持了具有竞争力的准确性。

Conclusion: PPN 为经济高效的 LLM 部署提供了一个系统的自适应框架，推进了用于可扩展和可持续语言模型应用的轻量级优化技术的设计。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Motivation: 探索天气基础模型 (WFM) 对现代社会天气敏感型基础设施的具体价值。

Method: 在 Hydro-Québec 的资产观测数据上微调 Silurian AI 的 1.5B 参数 WFM，Generative Forecasting Transformer (GFT)。

Result: 在 6-72 小时的提前期内，定制模型超越了最先进的 NWP 基准，温度 MAE 降低 15%，总降水量 MAE 降低 35%，风速 MAE 降低 15%。对于提前一天的雨凇检测，平均精度得分为 0.72。

Conclusion: 经过少量高保真数据进行后训练的 WFM 可以作为下一代电网弹性智能的实用基础。

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为InfMasking的对比协同信息提取方法，旨在通过无限掩码策略增强协同信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态表征学习方法难以有效捕捉协同信息的完整范围，导致在需要此类交互的任务中表现欠佳。协同信息是多模态表征的根本价值主张。

Method: InfMasking在融合过程中随机遮蔽来自每个模态的大部分特征，仅保留部分信息以创建具有不同协同模式的表征。然后通过互信息最大化将未掩蔽的融合表征与掩蔽的融合表征对齐，以编码全面的协同信息。

Result: 通过受控实验，证明了InfMasking能够有效增强模态之间的协同信息。在大规模真实世界数据集上的评估表明，InfMasking在七个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略，能够捕获更丰富的交互，因为它在训练期间将模型暴露于不同的部分模态组合。

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

*Payal Mohapatra,Yueyuan Sui,Akash Pandey,Stephen Xia,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAESTRO是一个新的框架，它克服了现有模态学习方法的关键限制，例如依赖单一的主模态进行对齐、模态的成对建模以及假设完整的模态观察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决实际多模态时间序列设置中主模态先验通常不清楚、模态数量可能很大以及传感器故障经常导致任意缺失观察的问题。

Method: MAESTRO通过基于任务相关性的动态内模态和跨模态交互，并利用符号标记化和自适应注意预算来构建长多模态序列，这些序列通过稀疏跨模态注意进行处理。

Result: 在三个应用程序的四个不同数据集上，MAESTRO在完整观察下比现有的多模态和多变量方法分别平均相对提高了4%和8%。在部分观察下（最多缺少40%的模态），MAESTRO平均提高了9%。

Conclusion: MAESTRO的稀疏、模态感知设计对于从动态时间序列中学习具有鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Result: DRL框架在优化动态网络中的资源分配方面优于启发式算法。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了DRL设计中未来HetNets的关键权衡。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is
challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel
conditions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that
jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a
multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness.
Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation
(PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three
heuristic algorithms in multiple network scenarios. Our results show that DRL
frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in
dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for
future HetNets.

TL;DR: ClustRecNet：一个基于深度学习的推荐框架，用于为给定数据集选择最合适的聚类算法。


<details>

Motivation: 解决无监督学习中聚类算法选择的长期挑战。

Method: 构建包含34,000个合成数据集的综合数据存储库，使用10种流行的聚类算法处理每个数据集，并通过调整兰德指数（ARI）评估聚类结果，用于训练和评估深度学习模型。该网络架构集成了卷积、残差和注意力机制，以捕获来自输入数据的局部和全局结构模式。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，该深度学习模型始终优于传统的聚类有效性指标（CVI）以及最先进的AutoML聚类推荐方法。在合成数据上，相对于Calinski-Harabasz指数，实现了0.497的ARI改进，在真实世界数据上，相对于性能最佳的AutoML方法，实现了15.3%的ARI提升。

Conclusion: ClustRecNet有效地为数据集推荐合适的聚类算法，优于传统方法和AutoML方法。

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

Motivation: 目前对于大型语言模型在预训练期间的缩放规律研究广泛，但其在强化学习后训练中的行为在很大程度上仍未被探索。

Method: 通过54个实验，研究了模型规模、数据量和计算预算如何相互作用以影响性能。

Result: 主要有四个发现：(1) 在固定计算预算下，训练步骤较少的大模型始终优于训练步骤较多的小模型。(2) 在给定固定数量的训练数据的情况下，较大的模型实现了卓越的样本效率，从而降低了损失。(3) 在数据受限的情况下，重复使用高质量数据非常有效，因为最终性能主要由优化步骤的总数决定，而不是样本的唯一性。(4) 这些缩放行为在基础模型和指令调整模型中都很稳健，即使在绝对精度上有所不同，它们也具有相似的学习动态（例如，较大的模型显示出更快的收敛速度）。

Conclusion: 这些结果为通过强化学习后训练有效扩展LLM的推理能力提供了原则性基础和实践指南。

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于CVAE的过采样框架LEO-CVAE，用于解决类不平衡问题，特别是在高维生物医学数据中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的过采样方法如SMOTE依赖于局部线性插值，容易产生不合理的合成样本。CVAE等深度生成模型虽然能更好地捕捉非线性分布，但忽略了不确定和边界区域样本的重要性。

Method: 该方法通过计算样本邻域的香农熵来量化不确定性，并利用局部熵加权损失（LEWL）和熵引导采样策略来集中生成信息量大的、类重叠区域的样本。

Result: 在临床基因组学数据集（ADNI和TCGA肺癌）上的实验结果表明，LEO-CVAE持续提高了分类器性能，优于传统的过采样和生成模型。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知生成过采样对于受复杂非线性结构（如组学数据）支配的领域中的不平衡学习具有重要价值。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

Conclusion: 近临界步长会引发梯度下降的混沌状态，长期动态不可预测，且不存在简单的隐式偏差。

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.
