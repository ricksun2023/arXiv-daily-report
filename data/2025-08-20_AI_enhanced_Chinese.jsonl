To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer\nType-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates\nconsumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type\ntheory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and\nexpert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.\nsatisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction\nhistories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user\ntypes in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate\nuser types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that\ndynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query\ncomplexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse\nReinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like\nstrategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,\nand Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces\ninteraction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that\nboth consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance\ngains.

One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is\nidiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be\nunderstood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.\nIn this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect\nidiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We\nevaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1\ndistillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four\nidiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller\nand more varied than expected.

Recent studies have explored frequency\ndomain analysis, which effectively models periodic patterns in user sequences.\nHowever, existing frequency-domain SR models still face two major drawbacks:\n(i) limited frequency band coverage, often missing critical behavioral patterns\nin a specific frequency range, and (ii) lack of personalized frequency\nfiltering, as they apply an identical filter for all users regardless of their\ndistinct frequency characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel frequency-domain model, Mixture of User-adaptive Frequency FIlteriNg\n(MUFFIN), operating through two complementary modules. (i) The global filtering\nmodule (GFM) handles the entire frequency spectrum to capture comprehensive\nbehavioral patterns. (ii) The local filtering module (LFM) selectively\nemphasizes important frequency bands without excluding information from other\nranges. (iii) In both modules, the user-adaptive filter (UAF) is adopted to\ngenerate user-specific frequency filters tailored to individual unique\ncharacteristics.

However, such norm-bounded\nexamples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have\na few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial\nexamples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained\nattacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this\npaper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that\ngenerates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by\nstrategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a\nmulti-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial\nexamples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and\npropagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this\nprocess by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,\nenabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base\nattack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models\nacross CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on\nLp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nperceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates\n(e.g., 20.63\\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,\nLPIPS, and FID (improvements $\\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).\nFurthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical\nand strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted\nadaptive attacks for each new defense.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAASH is a meta-attack framework that generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods.", "motivation": "norm-bounded examples often fail to align well with human perception, and it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy.", "method": "a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods", "result": "achieving higher attack success rates and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM, LPIPS, and FID", "conclusion": "DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks and generalizes well to unseen defenses."}}

Can we trust the prediction of compressed\nmodels just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing\nwork has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related\nperformance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee\ntrust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence\nevaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base\ntheir predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to\nmeasure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures\nwhether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted\nprobabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability\ndiagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its\nmultiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:\nnatural language inference and paraphrase identification.

While diversity-aware algorithms exist, they suffer from two major\nlimitations. First, they fail to account for normative diversity, which\nrequires fair access to a broad range of perspectives. Second, they typically\napply diversity late in the system's pipeline, after a lot of content has\nalready been filtered out. Both limitations confine their effectiveness and\nprevent them from promoting true normative diversity in news recommendations.\n  We propose Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) to address these\nlimitations. Our framework introduces diversity into the earliest pipeline\nstage and uses a configurable mechanism to align diversity with specific\ndemocratic goals. A2CG represents each news article using multiple aspects of\nperspectives (e.g., sentiment, political leaning, frame) and uses a Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to create a discrete, multi-faceted\nrepresentation. A decoder-only model then learns user preferences over these\naspect codes. We then inject diversity directly by reversing the sign on some\nof the query vector's aspects during the candidate retrieval process, ensuring\na more diverse set of candidates.\n  Our method, evaluated on the MIND dataset, enables a flexible trade-off\nbetween personalization and diversity early in the recommendation pipeline.

In\nresponse, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment\nmodels with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.\nSpecifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac\nknowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these\nplans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific\ncustomization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine\nplans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as\ncomplex.

To effectively\nmodel intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism\nwithin the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this\nmechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the\nmodel's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.\nThe deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused\nfeatures, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.\nExperimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social\nmedia data into informative and noninformative categories across various\nnatural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and\n5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal\ndata. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into\nthe sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to\nreal time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize\nthe accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal\nanalysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work\npresents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis\nmanagement solutions.

Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and\ngeneralization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of\nreal-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nstructured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables\nautomatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual\nrisk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy\nto produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as\nknowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much\nsmaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision\nfor Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding\nlow-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware\ncaptions.

However,\nexisting systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:\ndecisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not\nnecessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our\nwork aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching\n(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative\napproach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task\nlike existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most\nconfident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,\ncomatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the\nhuman decision maker to provably maximize performance.

We demonstrate the versatile applicability of\nour heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)\npost-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)\nFinite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier\nseparation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing\nmethods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under\nuniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU.

The current MER methods in deep learning\nmainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image\nsequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'\nfine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This\npaper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical\nattention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D\nand 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN\nAMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network\nResnet18 and attention modules.

While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform\non EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally\nstructured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid\nparadigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream\ndeep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's\nintrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of\nDL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework\ndesigned to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert\nattention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models\ntrained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise\nreasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to\neffectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the\npolicy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with\nclinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive\nexperiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the\nintrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also\nenhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen\nclinical domains.

Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this\nchallenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate\nstructured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,\nhighlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward\nstructured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in\nSFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured\nReinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially\nbreaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,\ncontaining 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate\nsimplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art\nperformance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a\nplateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method\nleverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual\nand visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate\nfine-grained code details.

Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN\nprimarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting\ngeometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored\nhow to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a\nnew framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer\nparadigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D\nGaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks.

However, LIME's inherent\nrandomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability\nissues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data\nscarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples\nthat deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may\nfail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original\nmodel. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer\nLearning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and\nstability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance\ntransfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances\nfrom a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target\ndomain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into\nclusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random\nperturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the\nsource cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance.

This limitation undermines their performance in terms of\ncoordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge\nwith CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural\ncausal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is\nthe Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from\nagent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states\ninfluence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action\nselection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting\nthem accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when\nneeded.

This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific\ntasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently\noverlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned\nLLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of\nexecuting harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned\nto execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix\nINjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends\nautomatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding\nthem to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.\nSpecifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)\ngenerating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task\nperformance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING\nsignificantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing\ntheir effectiveness.

However, incorporating natural\nlanguage-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains\nlargely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,\nresulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling\nfine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is\nchallenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained\nsynchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous\ntime series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual\nsemantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and\nmulti-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges\nby introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),\nan autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series\nwith textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses\nautoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced\ntemporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching\ntimesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The\nunderlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that\nefficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.\nExtensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF\noutperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series\nforecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher\nforecasting accuracy and $1.13\\times$ faster training efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "EventTSF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7eb3\u5165\u5176\u4e2d\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4ecd\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7136\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u8d77\u7740\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "method": "EventTSF\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f-\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u3002\u5e95\u5c42\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001U\u578b\u6269\u6563Transformer\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "result": "EventTSF\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8610.7%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.13\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "EventTSF\u57288\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cEventTSF\u4f18\u4e8e12\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8610.7%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.13\u500d\u3002"}}

The sophisticated\nanalysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional\nand medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML\napproaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in\nhealthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these\nchallenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit\nemotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment\nAnalysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs.

However, its\nhigh computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains\nhave shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural\nnetworks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing\naccuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural\nframework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a\nsingle-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core\nchallenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable\neffective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs\ninitialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization\nacross diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric\nnormalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.\nLearnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in\npost-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and\nsimple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,\ngeneralizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic\nmanner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction.

Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms\ninfinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent\nspace, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear\ninteractions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the\nLocal-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in\nturbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details\nand nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in\nexisting neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a\ndynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate\nlinear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical\nsystems.

However,\nexisting methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and\ngeometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between\nconflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual\ndecoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we\nintroduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for\nthe semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric\nbranch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,\ndecoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.\nOur dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are\nthen utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D\nfeatures. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module\nthat addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by\nanisotropically merging them into a unified representation.

Code and data: https://github.com/tianyiniu/RotBench", "summary": "We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can\naccurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\\deg}, 90{\\deg},\n180{\\deg}, and 270{\\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning\ncapabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships\nwithin images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information\n-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought\nprompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}.

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it\nrequires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which\nneglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,\nand increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label\ngeneration and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates\ndiverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms\nexisting baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks\nwhere clients possess valuable private data but limited computational\nresources.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedOL\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60(FL)\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7e41\u91cd\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u4e8e\u503e\u659c\u7684\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5c11\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f7f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u5316\u3002", "method": "FedOL\u91c7\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4ec5\u5728\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ea4\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002FedOL\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u7ec6\u5316\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002FedOL\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "FedOL\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u8f93\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "FedOL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u62e5\u6709\u5b9d\u8d35\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this\nburden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,\nadvanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient\nhandling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential\nin semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for\nsemi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the\ndiversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data\nperspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with\nMamba's scanning modeling characteristics.

However,\ncurrent methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target\ntext or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics\ninto a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering\nfine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its\nbackground. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a\ncritical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in\nVLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline\nwithin VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we\npropose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to\nattack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the\nwidely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into\nfine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over\nadversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens\nrather than a single global representation.

However, with the advancements of\npre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization\nand often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.\nWhile the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a\ndownstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands\nnovel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and\nadapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit\nadapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed\nbandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to\nefficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via\nin-context learning.

Non-rigid\nregistration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template\n(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information\nfrom multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of\nknown use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and\nregistration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex\nprogramming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of\nthe results from the convex solutions.

Existing methods have attempted to infer the\nintrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two\nmajor challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive\npriors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other\nmodels intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited\ninterpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we\npropose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable\nexpressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,\nwe introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where\nLLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise\nconstitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially\nreduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a\nvision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual\nsimulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law\nand the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level\nevolution.
