Existing systems typically address either natural language querying or narrow aspects of database administration, lacking a unified and intelligent interface for general-purpose database interaction. We introduce AskDB, a large language model powered agent designed to bridge this gap by supporting both data analysis and administrative operations over SQL databases through natural language. Built on Gemini 2, AskDB integrates two key innovations: a dynamic schema-aware prompting mechanism that effectively incorporates database metadata, and a task decomposition framework that enables the agent to plan and execute multi-step actions. These capabilities allow AskDB to autonomously debug derived SQL, retrieve contextual information via real-time web search, and adaptively refine its responses. We evaluate AskDB on a widely used Text-to-SQL benchmark and a curated set of DBA tasks, demonstrating strong performance in both analytical and administrative scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of AskDB as a unified and intelligent agent for relational database systems, offering an intuitive and accessible experience for end users.", "AI": {"tldr": "AskDB\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301SQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u667a\u80fd\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7ec4\u5408\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u6790\u67e5\u8be2\u6216\u6267\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "AskDB\u57fa\u4e8eGemini 2\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "AskDB\u5728Text-to-SQL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cDBA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "AskDB\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f4\u89c2\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We also analyzed the consistency of the information obtained and what it adds to the existing databases. The extracted liquidus temperatures comprise 5,696 compositions; the second subset includes 4,298 refractive indexes and, finally, 1,771 compositions with Abbe numbers. The extraction performed here increases the available information by approximately 10.4% for liquidus temperature, 6.6% for refractive index, and 4.9% for Abbe number. The impact extends beyond quantity: the newly extracted data introduce compositions with property values that are more diverse than those in existing databases, thereby expanding the accessible compositional and property space for glass modeling applications.

To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u4e2dChain-of-Thought (CoT)\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cCoT prompting\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528MGSM\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5--ContextCite\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u522b\u5f52\u56e0\uff09\u548cInseq\uff08\u7528\u4e8etoken\u7ea7\u522b\u5f52\u56e0\uff09\u3002", "result": "(1) \u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6570\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f3a\u8c03\u6700\u540e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff1b(2) \u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684CoT prompting\u4e3b\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u62c9\u4e01\u8bed\u7cfb\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b(3) \u901a\u8fc7\u5426\u5b9a\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u53e5\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86CoT prompting\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy.

Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u6279\u6b21\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e863D\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5177\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Adaptive Query Processing (AQP) strategies address this limitation by providing a more robust query execution mechanism. Specifically, plan-based AQP achieves this by incrementally refining cardinality using feedback from the execution of sub-plans. However, the actual reason behind the improvements of plan-based AQP, especially across different storage architectures (on-disk vs. in-memory DBMSs), remains unexplored.\n  This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art plan-based AQP. We implement and evaluate this strategy on both on-disk and in-memory DBMSs across two benchmarks. Our key findings reveal that while plan-based AQP provides overall speedups in both environments, the sources of improvement differ significantly. In the on-disk DBMS, PostgreSQL, performance gains primarily come from the query plan reorderings, but not the cardinality updating mechanism; in fact, updating cardinalities introduces measurable overhead. Conversely, in the in-memory DBMS, DuckDB, cardinality refinement drives significant performance improvements for most queries. We also observe significant performance benefits of the plan-based AQP compared to a state-of-the-art related-based AQP method.

This design enables expressive matching while allowing efficient computation of scores, as the multi-vector document representations could be pre-computed offline. ColBERT models distance using a Chamfer-style function: for each query token, it selects the closest document token and sums these distances across all query tokens.\n  In our work, we explore enhancements to the Chamfer distance function by computing a weighted sum over query token contributions, where weights reflect the token importance. Empirically, we show that this simple extension, requiring only token-weight training while keeping the multi-vector representations fixed, further enhances the expressiveness of late interaction multi-vector mechanism. In particular, on the BEIR benchmark, our method achieves an average improvement of 1.28\\% in Recall@10 in the zero-shot setting using IDF-based weights, and 3.66\\% through few-shot fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "ColBERT \u901a\u8fc7\u5728 token \u7ea7\u522b\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5339\u914d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u67e5\u8be2 token \u8d21\u732e\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u6765\u6539\u8fdb Chamfer \u8ddd\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6743\u91cd\u53cd\u6620\u4e86 token \u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a Chamfer \u8ddd\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7token\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8d4b\u4e88\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "method": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u67e5\u8be2 token \u8d21\u732e\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u548c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6743\u91cd\u53cd\u6620 token \u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ec5\u8fdb\u884c token \u6743\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728 BEIR \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 zero-shot \u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e IDF \u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0cRecall@10 \u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 1.28%\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 few-shot \u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 3.66%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9 Chamfer \u8ddd\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u5355\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u53ea\u9700 token \u6743\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86 late interaction multi-vector \u673a\u5236\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3002"}}

By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.\n  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.\n  This framework establishes the groundwork for interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-improving reasoning architectures, offering a step toward persistent memory in large-scale agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u5e38\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u91cd\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u5148\u524d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\u51b3\u7b56\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u91cd\u7528\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions.

In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows.

Standard retrievers, optimized for query-document similarity, frequently fail to align with the downstream goal of generating a precise answer. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework that optimizes the retriever for Answer Alignment. Specifically, we first identify high-quality positive chunks by evaluating their sufficiency to generate the correct answer. We then employ a curriculum-based contrastive learning scheme to fine-tune the retriever. This curriculum leverages LLM-constructed Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to generate augmented queries, which in turn mine progressively challenging hard negatives. This process trains the retriever to distinguish the answer-sufficient positive chunks from these nuanced distractors, enhancing its generalization. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets from the Ultradomain and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that our fine-tuned retriever achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving 14.5% over the base model without substantial architectural modifications and maintaining strong efficiency for long-context RAG.

These instructions are typically presented in natural language format and include general guidelines and step-by-step procedures with complex constraints. Existing TOD benchmarks often oversimplify the complex nature of these instructions by reducing them to simple schemas composed of intents, slots, and API call configurations. To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance.

For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u76846D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5bc6\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4ee5\u906e\u6321\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ICBIN\u548cBOP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684CAD\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\uff1a\u52a8\u6001\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5bc6\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4ee5\u906e\u6321\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728ICBIN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e865%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728BOP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea63\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u906e\u6321\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u5730\u4f30\u8ba16D\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u3002"}}

Despite the impressive performance, the constant high volume of new user-item interactions makes it difficult to adapt to the evolution of user preference over time, especially for LLM-based recommender systems. The challenge arises from the large number of parameters in LLMs, which makes traditional evolution methods (i.e., Re-training or Fine-tuning) impractical. Specifically, Re-training with all interactions results in prohibitively high computational costs. On the other hand, fine-tuning with only new interactions leads to preference forgetting among inactive users, ultimately compromising overall performance. To tackle this problem, we propose EvoRec, an efficient Locate-Forget-Update framework designed for LLM-based recommender systems to model the evolution of user preferences. EvoRec identifies a small set of parameters associated with preference changes and updates them precisely, thereby saving computational resources while maintaining strong recommendation performance. Notably, the modified parameters account for only 30\\% of LoRA adapter parameters, with no additional parameters introduced. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, EvoRec not only efficiently evolves LLMRec to adapt to the preferences of active users, but also preserves the interests of inactive users from being disturbed during evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEvoRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u6f14\u53d8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u5168\u91cf\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u597d\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEvoRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEvoRec\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u975e\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoRec\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6f14\u5316LLMRec\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5bf9\u975e\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARC-AGI\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u989c\u8272\u91cf\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684instruction-first\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u7f51\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6216DSL\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5728generate-execute-select\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5206\u79bb\u6307\u4ee4\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5206\u79bb\u6307\u4ee4\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u6a21\u6001\u65bd\u52a0\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6587\u672c\u5c062D\u7ed3\u6784\u5c55\u5e73\u4e3a1D tokens\uff0c\u800c\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u7559\u5e03\u5c40\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165patch-size aliasing\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u54ea\u4e9b\u7f51\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u88ab\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u96c6\u5408\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406pipeline\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u4e5d\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e8c\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u6355\u63492D\u5f62\u72b6\u4f46\u5bf9\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6267\u884c\u6548\u679c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u793a\u4e0etransformer\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6267\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u793a\u4e0etransformer\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6267\u884c\u3002"}}

Some of these perturbations even survive physical capture, posing security risks to high-stakes applications such as document processing, license plate recognition, and automated compliance systems. Existing defenses, such as adversarial training, input preprocessing, or post-recognition correction, are often model-specific, computationally expensive, and affect performance on unperturbed inputs while remaining vulnerable to unseen or adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, TopoReformer is introduced, a model-agnostic reformation pipeline that mitigates adversarial perturbations while preserving the structural integrity of text images. Topology studies properties of shapes and spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, focusing on global structures such as connectivity, holes, and loops rather than exact distance. Leveraging these topological features, TopoReformer employs a topological autoencoder to enforce manifold-level consistency in latent space and improve robustness without explicit gradient regularization. The proposed method is benchmarked on EMNIST, MNIST, against standard adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), adaptive attacks (EOT, BDPA), and an OCR-specific watermark attack (FAWA).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u4f1a\u8bef\u5bfcOCR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9OCR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTopoReformer\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6539\u9020\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u5f62\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728EMNIST\u3001MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u548cOCR\u7279\u5b9a\u6c34\u5370\u653b\u51fb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TopoReformer\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans.

While effective, this reductionist paradigm struggles to address the deeper question of what makes a good recommendation, and attempts to broaden evaluation, through user studies or fairness analyses, have had limited impact. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) disrupts this framework: LLMs are generative rather than ranking-based, making standard accuracy metrics questionable. They also introduce challenges such as hallucinations, knowledge cutoffs, non-determinism, and opaque training data, rendering traditional train/test protocols difficult to interpret. At the same time, LLMs create new opportunities, enabling natural-language interaction and even allowing models to act as evaluators.\n  This work argues that the shift toward LLM-driven MRS requires rethinking evaluation. We first review how LLMs reshape user modeling, item modeling, and natural-language recommendation in music.

These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA) \u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u63a7\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LM) \u7684\u524d\u7f00\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5ef6\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b (HMM) \u7b49\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5ef6\u7eed\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "LTLA \u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u524d\u7f00\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5ef6\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u91cf HMM \u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u5904\u7406\u6240\u6709\u5019\u9009\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a token\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ec5\u5c06\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e LM \u7684\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "LTLA \u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6 HMM\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5ef6\u7eed\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ee5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "LTLA \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning.

There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.\n  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a Box6D \u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7 6D \u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u4ed3\u5e93\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u7bb1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4ed3\u5e93\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6742\u4e71\u548c\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u7684\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684 6D \u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e CAD \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u4e8c\u5206\u67e5\u627e\u63a8\u65ad\u7bb1\u5b50\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7c7b\u522b CAD \u6a21\u677f\u4f30\u8ba1\u59ff\u6001\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u524d\u505c\u6b62\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5b58\u50a8\u573a\u666f\u548c\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea6 76% \u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684 6D \u59ff\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "Box6D \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7 6D \u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ed3\u5e93\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u7bb1\u3002"}}

A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.\n  Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference.

However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u7ebf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff08AFOCP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfOCP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfOCP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u65f6\u7edf\u4e00\u5bf9\u5f85\u6240\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "method": "AFOCP\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u6743\u8861\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0eOCP\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cAFOCP\u59cb\u7ec8\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1188\uff05\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u8986\u76d6\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "AFOCP\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning.

Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent.

In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u65bd\u5de5\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u65bd\u5de5\u73b0\u573a\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u591a\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5982\u4e66\u9762\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u68c0\u67e5\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u73b0\u573a\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5229\u7528GPT 4o\u7b49\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cMolmo 7B\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5371\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "Molmo 7B\u548cQuen2 VL 2B\u7b49\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u65bd\u5de5\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions.

To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment.

While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning.

We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes.

Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\\% mAP on domain-specific tasks.

We introduce SemanticCite, an AI-powered system that verifies citation accuracy through full-text source analysis while providing rich contextual information via detailed reasoning and relevant text snippets. Our approach combines multiple retrieval methods with a four-class classification system (Supported, Partially Supported, Unsupported, Uncertain) that captures nuanced claim-source relationships and enables appropriate remedial actions for different error types. Our experiments show that fine-tuned lightweight language models achieve performance comparable to large commercial systems with significantly lower computational requirements, making large-scale citation verification practically feasible. The system provides transparent, evidence-based explanations that support user understanding and trust. We contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 citations with detailed alignments, functional classifications, semantic annotations, and bibliometric metadata across eight disciplines, alongside fine-tuned models and the complete verification framework as open-source software.

These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u548c\u8bb0\u5f55\u6761\u4ef6\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u76f8\u5f53\u5927\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u76d1\u7763\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f39\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.\n  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the \"Full\" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the \"Scarce\" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.\n  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.\n  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).", "AI": {"tldr": "GLOBE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u8d28\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b83\u4ece\u8fb9\u754c\u5143\u7d20\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b49\u53d8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08CAE\uff09\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "GLOBE\u5c06\u89e3\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u6838\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\uff0c\u4ece\u8fb9\u754c\u8868\u9762\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u652f\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d85\u5c42\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5947\u5076\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u7ec6\u7f51\u683c\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u4f4d\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728AirFRANS\uff08NACA\u7ffc\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29RANS\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cGLOBE\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728\u201cFull\u201d\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u573a\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ea6200\u500d\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ea650\u500d\u3002\u5728\u201cScarce\u201d\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u548c\u538b\u529b\u573a\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86100\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u538b\u529b\u573a\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86600\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u9886\u57df\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08CAE\uff09\u3002"}}

From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning.

However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u71b5\uff08SeSE\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316LLM\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6709\u5411\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u65b9\u5411\u8bed\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u62bd\u8c61\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u3002SeSE\u88ab\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6700\u4f73\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u7801\u6811\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u71b5\u3002", "result": "\u572829\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b-\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSeSE\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5148\u8fdbUQ\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SeSE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u91cf\u5316LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation.

To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings.

However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task.

LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H).

However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only \"simple\" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines.

Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5c42\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u5c5e\u6027 tokens\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\u533a\u5206\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u578b\u7535\u5546\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\u533a\u5206\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u578b\u7535\u5546\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e BART \u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u7531\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49 tokens\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7c7b\u522b\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5c5e\u6027-\u503c\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5c5e\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u7535\u5546\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684 pipeline \u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

This work explores fairness in multi-modal medical image reasoning using in-context learning", "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\uff08FADS\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u62bd\u6837\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u65cf\u88d4\u76f8\u5173\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\uff08FADS\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u62bd\u6837\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFADS\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u65cf\u88d4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Please cite the conference proceedings when available", "summary": "Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\uff08rationale\uff09\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982sufficiency\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86rationale\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5305\u62ectoken\u5206\u7c7b\u548cattention\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06sufficiency\u4e0etoken\u5206\u7c7b\u548cattention\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e24\u79cd\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u7814\u7a76rationale\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684rationale\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1bsufficiency\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u975erationale\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5c06rationale\u4fe1\u606f\u7eb3\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u800c\u5f02\uff1bsufficiency\u548ctoken\u5206\u7c7b\u4e4b\u95f4\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "rationale\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

Dolatabadi", "Sarah Erfani", "Christopher Leckie"], "title": "Exploiting Inter-Sample Information for Long-tailed Out-of-Distribution Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods.

Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\\% for code blocks, 94.0\\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities. AICC also surpasses RefinedWeb and FineWeb on key benchmarks.

Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making.

A self-supervised representation was pretrained with the large MIR spectral library and the Variational Autoencoder algorithm to obtain a compressed latent space for generating spectral embeddings. At this stage, only unlabeled spectral data were used, allowing us to leverage the full spectral database and the availability of scan repeats for augmented training. We also leveraged and froze the trained MIR decoder for a spectrum conversion task by plugging it into a NIR encoder to learn the mapping between NIR and MIR spectra in an attempt to leverage the predictive capabilities contained in the large MIR library with a low cost portable NIR scanner. This was achieved by using a smaller subset of the KSSL library with paired NIR and MIR spectra. Downstream machine learning models were then trained to map between original spectra, predicted spectra, and latent space embeddings for nine soil properties. The performance of was evaluated independently of the KSSL training data using a gold-standard test set, along with regression goodness-of-fit metrics. Compared to baseline models, the proposed SSML and its embeddings yielded similar or better accuracy in all soil properties prediction tasks. Predictions derived from the spectrum conversion (NIR to MIR) task did not match the performance of the original MIR spectra but were similar or superior to predictive performance of NIR-only models, suggesting the unified spectral latent space can effectively leverage the larger and more diverse MIR dataset for prediction of soil properties not well represented in current NIR libraries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SSML\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u571f\u58e4\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578bMIR\u5149\u8c31\u5e93\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0fNIR\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dNIR\u5e93\u4e2d\u571f\u58e4\u5c5e\u6027\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7b97\u6cd5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5149\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684MIR\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u8c31\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5176\u63d2\u5165NIR\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6765\u5b66\u4e60NIR\u548cMIR\u5149\u8c31\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SSML\u53ca\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u6240\u6709\u571f\u58e4\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u4ece\u5149\u8c31\u8f6c\u6362\uff08NIR\u5230MIR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u539f\u59cbMIR\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u4ec5NIR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684MIR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5f53\u524dNIR\u5e93\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u6027\u8d28\u3002"}}

Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u6253\u5370\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7eb9\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u8863\u670d\u3001\u88e4\u5b50\u548c\u5e3d\u5b50\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u884c\u8d70\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u90fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u8fd8\u662f\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9010\u5e27\u4f18\u5316\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5177\u6709\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u59ff\u52bf\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u670d\u88c5\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u85cf\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u4ea7\u54c1\u56fe\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u5230UV\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u70b9\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ICC\u9501\u5b9a\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6240\u6709\u989c\u8272\u53ef\u6253\u5370\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4eba\u4f53-\u670d\u88c5\u7ba1\u9053\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u70b9\u3001\u5e03\u6599\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u671f\u671b-\u53d8\u6362\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u70b9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u89c6\u70b9\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5347\u534e\u6253\u5370\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u7269\u7406\u670d\u88c5\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u548c\u5ba4\u5916\u5f55\u97f3\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5730\u6b3a\u9a97\u4eba\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002"}}

Technical Report", "summary": "Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence.

In this study, an agent-based implementation of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-vaccinated (SEIRV) mathematical model was employed for machine learning (ML) predictions. Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms. Posed as a regression problem, the infected and recovered nodes were predicted, and the performance of these algorithms is compared using the error metrics of the train and test sets. The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set. The validation values were lower (0.992, 0.998, 0.971, and 0.999), as is typical when evaluating model performance on unseen data.

In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation.

Stochastic Gradient Descent Unlearning", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the impact of selected training data from a model without the computational expenses of retraining from scratch. Two such algorithms are ``Descent-to-Delete\" (D2D) and ``Rewind-to-Delete\" (R2D), full-batch gradient descent algorithms that are easy to implement and satisfy provable unlearning guarantees. In particular, the stochastic version of D2D is widely implemented as the ``finetuning\" unlearning baseline, despite lacking theoretical backing on nonconvex functions. In this work, we prove $(\u03b5, \u03b4)$ certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic R2D and D2D for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions, by analyzing unlearning through the lens of disturbed or biased gradient systems, which may be contracting, semi-contracting, or expansive respectively. Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(\u03b5, \u03b4)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum. However, unlike D2D, R2D can achieve unlearning in the convex and nonconvex setting because it draws the unlearned model closer to the retrained model by reversing the accumulated disturbances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684 machine unlearning \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f Descent-to-Delete (D2D) \u548c Rewind-to-Delete (R2D) \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d finetuning \u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u975e\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u800c D2D \u548c R2D \u7b97\u6cd5\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684 unlearning \u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u504f\u5dee\u68af\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790 unlearning \u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a R2D \u548c D2D \u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u3001\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86 (\u03b5, \u03b4) certified unlearning \u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a D2D \u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4 R2D \u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e D2D \u4e0d\u540c\uff0cR2D \u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0 unlearning\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u8f6c\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4f7f unlearned \u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1 retrained \u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u968f\u673a D2D \u548c R2D \u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 (\u03b5, \u03b4) certified unlearning \u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684 unlearning \u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4e9a\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u5bf9\u9f50 (SGA) \u548c\u968f\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u63a9\u853d (RTM)\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a (i) \u6c38\u8fdc\u65e0\u6cd5\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14 (ii) \u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u90fd\u626d\u66f2\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "SGA \u4f7f\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7597\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4e9a\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6d88\u9664\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u3002RTM \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u968f\u673a\u66ff\u6362\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "SGA \u548c RTM \u7684\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u5408\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002RTM \u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c SGA \u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "conclusion": "SGA \u548c RTM \u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7279\u800c\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts.

While traditional data-driven methods attempt to bridge this gap using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), they often suffer from severe, non-random data missingness (e.g., due to cloud cover or nighttime) and inversion biases. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the Spatiotemporal Physics-Guided Inference Network (SPIN), a novel framework designed for inductive spatiotemporal kriging. Unlike conventional approaches, SPIN synergistically integrates domain knowledge into deep learning by explicitly modeling physical advection and diffusion processes via parallel graph kernels. Crucially, we introduce a paradigm-shifting training strategy: rather than using error-prone AOD as a direct input, we repurpose it as a spatial gradient constraint within the loss function. This allows the model to learn structural pollution patterns from satellite data while remaining robust to data voids.

This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u6765\u4e30\u5bcc\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f5c\u7269\u51a0\u5c42\u6027\u72b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u4f5c\u7269\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5fae\u5730\u5757\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u7f8e\u56fd\u7389\u7c73\u5e2684\u4e2a\u6742\u4ea4\u7389\u7c73\u54c1\u79cd\u7684\u536b\u661f-\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4f20\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u536b\u661f\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u4ea7\u91cf\u548c\u6c2e\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5f25\u5408\u519c\u4e1a\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u536b\u661f\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs.

We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery.

In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients.

While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality.

This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $\u03ba$ of 0.816.

Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula.

This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations.

Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system.

Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10.

However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons.

This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques. Each of the nested models performs on par or better than the SoTA in accuracy. Moreover, unlike other compression methods, the nested capability of our approach allows having a many-in-one reasoning model that has constant deployment memory against the number of models in the family.", "AI": {"tldr": "Nemotron Elastic\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u7236\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u591a\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5957\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u9884\u7b97\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u9762\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u7684LLM\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6df7\u5408Mamba-Attention\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7236\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u4eab\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u671f\u95f4\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd9\u79cd\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u6bcf\u4e2a\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6570\u5343\u4ebf\u4e2atoken\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNemotron Elastic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7d27\u5bc6\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86group-aware SSM elastification\u3001\u5f02\u6784MLP elastification\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316MSE\u7684\u5c42\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u6df1\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u6b65\u591a\u9884\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5c06Nemotron Elastic\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eNemotron Nano V2 12B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528110B\u8bad\u7ec3token\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u62109B\u548c6B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc7360\u500d\uff0c\u4e0eSoTA\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u6bd4\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea67\u500d\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5957\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eSoTA\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u80fd\u529b\u5141\u8bb8\u62e5\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5408\u4e00\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u6052\u5b9a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4e0e\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "Nemotron Elastic\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u7684LLM\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u90e8\u7f72\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose ILoRA, a unified framework that integrates three core innovations: a QR-based orthonormal initialization to ensure all clients start in a coherent subspace; a Concatenated QR Aggregation mechanism that fuses heterogeneous-rank updates via concatenation and decomposition, preserving information while maintaining dimension alignment; and an AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates to correct local updates and mitigate client drift.

Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08CP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u6279\u6b21\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u4e32\u884c\u6279\u5904\u7406\uff08s-batch\uff09\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u865a\u62df\u6279\u6b21\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4e0a\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65cf\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684CP\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u865a\u62df\u6279\u6b21\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u6279\u6b21\u5927\u5c0f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684CP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u9f50\u53c2\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4e0a\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65cf\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u641c\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u52a0\u5f3a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f20\u64ad\u5668\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7ea7\u522b\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fd1\u4e94\u5343\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe100\u4e2a\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u4e2d\u5c0f\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe500\u4e2a\u4f5c\u4e1a\u300110\u4e2a\u65cf\u548c10\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u7684\u5927\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5176\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u597d25%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u6279\u6b21\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u4e32\u884c\u6279\u5904\u7406\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u3002"}}

This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable \"gentle polishing process\" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability.

Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aT2T-VICL\u7684pipeline\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60(VICL)\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5f53\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLM)\u662f\u5426\u8fd8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60(VICL)\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u6765\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u597d\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1VICL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\n2. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6570\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6765\u6267\u884c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1VICL\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u53e6\u5916\u5341\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1VICL\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable.

This work investigates the \"Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter\" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u201c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u201d\uff08AOPF\uff09\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5982ChebyNet\uff09\u56e0\u5176\u9759\u6001\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5728[-1, 1]\u57df\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1aL-JacobiNet\u548cS-JacobiNet\u3002\u53d1\u73b0[0, infty)\u57df\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c[-1, 1]\u57df\uff08Jacobi\uff09\u5728\u9ad8K\uff08K>20\uff09\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002ChebyNet\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7f3a\u9677\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5176\u9759\u6001\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u9759\u6001S-JacobiNet\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94L-JacobiNet\u3002", "motivation": "\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5982ChebyNet\uff09\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5728[-1, 1]\u57df\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1) L-JacobiNet\uff0cChebyNet\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684alpha\uff0cbeta\u5f62\u72b6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca2) S-JacobiNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868LayerNorm\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9759\u6001ChebyNet\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e[0, infty)\u57df\u4e2d\u7684AOPF\uff08\u4f8b\u5982LaguerreNet\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0[0, infty)\u57df\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c[-1, 1]\u57df\uff08Jacobi\uff09\u5728\u9ad8K\uff08K>20\uff09\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u9759\u6001S-JacobiNet\uff08ChebyNet+LayerNorm\uff09\u57285\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u76844\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94L-JacobiNet\u3002", "conclusion": "ChebyNet\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7f3a\u9677\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5b83\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5728[-1, 1]\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002S-JacobiNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u3001\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency.

Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments. We perform experiments on two common machine learning architectures and see increased prediction capability over a strong language-only baseline for 9/12 model-target pairs.

While double critics reduce such biases, the exploration potential of double actors remains underexplored. Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation.

Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI.

To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured \"Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines\" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a \"Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines\" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training.

This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a \"naive\" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as \"Instability Poisoning,\" where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses \"Late Fusion\" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u57df\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HybSpecNet\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684ChebyNet\u5206\u652f\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684KrawtchoukNet\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027-\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u201d\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u57df\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u534a\u65e0\u9650\u57df\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u9636\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u57dfGNN\uff0cHybSpecNet\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684`ChebyNet`\u5206\u652f\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684`KrawtchoukNet`\u5206\u652f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u665a\u878d\u5408\u6765\u9694\u79bb\u68af\u5ea6\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684HybSpecNet\u5728\u6240\u6709\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u90fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u9636\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6df7\u5408GNN\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u67b6\u6784\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations.

However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff08QECV\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f2a\u5f71\u51cf\u5c11\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709QECV\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff08QP\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2dQP\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u672a\u77e5\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u76f2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4f2a\u5f71\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f2a\u5f71\u51cf\u5c11\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728QP = 22\u65f6\uff0cPSNR\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u76f2\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86110%\uff08\u4ece0.31 dB\u63d0\u9ad8\u52300.65 dB\uff09\u3002\u5206\u5c42\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u5728QP = 22\u65f6\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4QP = 42\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728QP\u672a\u77e5\u6216\u9700\u8981\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5143\uff09\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a81\u7834\u5c06\u6765\u81ea\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5c11\u63ed\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u54ea\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u8be5\u613f\u666f\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u652f\u67f1\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff1a\uff08i\uff09LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\uff08ii\uff09\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6027\u80fd\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\uff08iii\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u522b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u5c06\u7b97\u6cd5\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u666f\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u63a5\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "result": "\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u52a0\u901f\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u6210\u529f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u4f7f\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4ece\u76f2\u76ee\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

With sufficient seed data, SHAP-guided approach matches real data performance, significantly outperforms na\u00efve generation, and substantially improves classification for underrepresented emotion classes.

We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm.

To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module.

Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators.

Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts. These findings advocate for a data-centric shift in TSAD research, emphasizing label utilization over purely algorithmic complexity.

Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP.

We show that both data-driven and physics-informed models can rapidly integrate complex dynamics, with a very low computational time (up to 1000x time reduction).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6848\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6838\u7535\u7ad9\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6838\u7535\u7ad9\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002Framatome \u5f00\u53d1\u7684 Operator Assistance Predictive System (OAPS) \u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236 (MPC) \u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6838\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u5806\u82af\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u6574\u5408\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5927\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbe 1000 \u500d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u6838\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u5806\u82af\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "LEGO-SLAM: A real-time SLAM system with open-vocabulary mapping using 3D Gaussian Splatting.", "motivation": "Existing SLAM systems lack open-vocabulary semantic understanding and adaptability for novel environments, while storing high-dimensional language features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead.", "method": "A scene-adaptive encoder-decoder distills language embeddings into a compact feature space, enabling real-time performance and a language-guided pruning strategy.", "result": "LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy with open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS and reduces the map's Gaussian count by over 60%.", "conclusion": "LEGO-SLAM is the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system, eliminating the need for a separate detection model by introducing a language-based loop detection approach."}}

Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTOFA\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u8054\u90a6VLM\u9002\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8f7b\u91cf\u5730\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLM)\u9002\u914d\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60VLM\u9002\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u653b\u51fb\uff1b\u5355\u6b21\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef-\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u8f6e\u6570\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u8054\u90a6VLM\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9002\u914dVLM\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a(1)\u5bf9VLM\u4e2d\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b(2)\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u9002\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff1b(3)\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6216\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "TOFA\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7ba1\u9053\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7ba1\u9053\uff0cTOFA\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\u7684\u672c\u5730\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u76849\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TOFA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TOFA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8054\u90a6VLM\u9002\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLM\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE) \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (MLLM) \u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u52a0\u5165\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86 MLLM \u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u878d\u5165\u5230\u5d4c\u5165\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u6307\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u539f\u7406\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5c55\u5f00\u540e\u63d0\u53d6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728 MMEB \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0creasoning-guided conditioning \u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 4.9%\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9879\u76ee\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u63a7\u5236\u65cb\u94ae\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a8\u8350\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u9075\u5faa\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u3001\u77ed\u6682\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6025\u5267\u8870\u9000\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 LHRL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u52a8\u6001\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u534f\u8c03\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002LHRL \u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) PhaseFormer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 STL \u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b(2) \u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u7ea7 HRL \u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u65bd\u52a0\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5373\u65f6\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a8\u8350\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLHRL \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6574\u5408\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e RL \u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4ea7\u751f\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy.

Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning.

The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.\n  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.\n  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation.

Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames.

By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency.

The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \\emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation.

We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement.

Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain. When working with such limited data, training sets are frequently constructed to be artificially balanced -- in particular in the case of few-shot learning -- failing to reflect real-world conditions. This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training. Specifically, we model the real-world distribution as Dirichlet-distributed random variables, effectively performing a prior augmentation during few-shot learning. Our experiments show that DirPA successfully shifts the decision boundary and stabilizes the training process by acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA) \u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u5206\u5e03\u7ecf\u5e38\u906d\u53d7\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9075\u5faa\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f5c\u7269\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u5e76\u4e14\u4ecd\u7136\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u3002\u5f53\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u5e73\u8861\u7684\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5efa\u8baeDirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u4e3b\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5ea6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aDirichlet\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u671f\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6267\u884c\u5148\u9a8c\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDirPA \u6210\u529f\u5730\u79fb\u52a8\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5145\u5f53\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "DirPA \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (VLM) \u751f\u6210\u5197\u957f\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u662f\u5ef6\u8fdfEOS token\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u5ef6\u957f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8f93\u51fatoken\u957f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027prompt\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u89e6\u53d1verbose\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6076\u610f\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684VLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684verbose-text induction attack\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8VLM\u751f\u6210\u5197\u957f\u6587\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning.

Uncertain communication delays across data streams challenge the temporal flow of the inference process. State-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference methods rely on a reference-modality paradigm, requiring one modality input to be fully received before processing, while depending on costly offline profiling. We propose a novel, neuro-inspired non-blocking inference paradigm that primarily employs adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to stochastic delay patterns across heterogeneous streams while relaxing the reference-modality requirement.

Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits.

A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity.

To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of \"exploration collapse\", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86pass@k\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u5bf9\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684pass@1\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5411\u52a0\u6743\u3002\u5f53\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u65f6\uff0cpass@k\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f1a\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u867d\u7136 pass@k \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u7528\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790pass@k\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "pass@k\u76ee\u6807\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u5bf9pass@1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6b63\u4f8b\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u3002\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0cpass@k\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f1a\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\uff0cpass@k\u548cpass@1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u4f1a\u7f29\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136 pass@k \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u7528\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u9f13\u52b1\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $\u03c0_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability.

This paper addresses these problems by proposing \\textbf{Geo}metric \\textbf{P}rototype \\textbf{T}rajectory \\textbf{H}ashing (GeoPTH), a novel, lightweight, and non-learning framework for efficient category-based trajectory retrieval. GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, \\textit{Hausdorff} metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings. Critically, GeoPTH consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency.

However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u5149-\u7ea2\u5916\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\uff08UDA-VI-ReID\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VI-ReID\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76UDA-VI-ReID\uff0c\u5c06\u4ece\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5373\u57df\u5171\u4eab\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08DSLGA\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u57df\u95f4\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u57df\u5185\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u3002DSLGA\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57df\u5171\u4eab\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff08DSLS\uff09\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u7531\u57df\u95f4\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u65e0\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u3002DSLGA\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff08GAS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u5230\u6574\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u5904\u7406\u7531\u5927\u7684\u57df\u5185\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684UDA-VI-ReID\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5CMDA-XD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u7684UDA-VI-ReID\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684VI-ReID\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e9b\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DSLGA\u6a21\u578b\u548cCMDA-XD\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728UDA-VI-ReID\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684VI-ReID\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.\n  In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\u53ca\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5316\u5de5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8282\u7ea6\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u6210\u672c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u5fc5\u987b\u4e25\u683c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u91cf\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u914d\u65b9\u53ca\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u4e1a\u95f4\u6b47\u805a\u5408\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u914d\u65b9\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6613\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework.

While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines.

Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems.

Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, \"Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles\" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.", "AI": {"tldr": "ICCE: unsupervised image classification via multi-head clustering, adaptive nearest neighbor selection, and cluster ensembling, achieving SOTA results.", "motivation": "Recent unsupervised image classification focuses solely on clustering, bypassing representation learning.

Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI).

However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration.

Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\\% and 4.3\\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction.

Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency.

As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes.

However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "YOFO\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u677f\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u5224\u65ad\u6240\u6709\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u9762\u4e34\u6839\u672c\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u8c03\u6574 MLLM \u8f93\u51fa\u5355\u4e00\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u5176\u751f\u6210\u6027\u8d28\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u5224\u5206\u6790\u5728\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u901f\u5ea6\u8fc7\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u677f\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u6cd5 YOFO\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u5224\u65ad\u6240\u6709\u9700\u6c42\u3002YOFO \u63a5\u53d7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfb\u53d6\u4e0e\u8be5\u9700\u6c42\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u4ee4\u724c\u7684 logits\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9700\u6c42\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u5143\u662f/\u5426\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "YOFO \u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u8350\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5176\u4e2d\u540e\u7eed\u5224\u65ad\u4ee5\u5148\u524d\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u4e8b\u540e CoT\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective. This study contributes to health information systems by offering a computational solution for integrated physical and mental healthcare and provides design principles for advancing collaborative chronic disease management across the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment phases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8eab\u4f53\u6162\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u548c\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60 (MTL) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u534f\u540c\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u62a4\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5065\u5eb7\u611f\u77e5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8eab\u4f53\u6162\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u6162\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u548c\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u534f\u540c\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u62a4\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u591a\u75be\u75c5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ea7\u53cc\u91cd\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60 (ADH-MTL) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7ec4\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u75be\u75c5\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cADH-MTL \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u6bcf\u4e00\u9879\u521b\u65b0\u90fd\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6574\u5408\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u62a4\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u8fdb\u534f\u540c\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5065\u5eb7\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u505a\u51fa\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}
