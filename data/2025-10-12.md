### [1] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了社交媒体平台如何改变我们对城市环境的理解，并提出了识别和阐明情感不一致的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的城市研究中的多维情感分析方法受到了挑战。

Method: 构建了一个包含140,750个百度和腾讯街景图像的数据集来衡量感知，以及984,024个微博社交媒体文本帖子来衡量观点。开发了一种反应指数，整合了目标检测和自然语言处理技术来分类情感。

Result: 感知情感反应趋势图显示出向更均匀分布的积极情感的转变，而观点情感反应趋势图显示出更极端的变化。不匹配图表明，多年来，人类感知和对城市地区的看法之间存在显着差异。情感反应的变化与密集建筑物和行人存在等因素密切相关。

Conclusion: 不一致的地图呈现了大流行之前和之后的感知和观点情感，并为环境管理提供了潜在的解释和方向，从而为城市更新制定了战略。

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

### [2] [Haystack Engineering: Context Engineering for Heterogeneous and Agentic Long-Context Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07414)
*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的长文本评估基准HaystackCraft，旨在更真实地模拟实际应用中噪声长文本环境，通过模拟biased检索和agentic工作流来评估长文本模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本模型在合成的“大海捞针”基准测试中表现良好，但忽略了实际应用中噪声上下文的产生方式，例如biased检索和agentic工作流中的级联错误。

Method: 构建了一个基于完整英文维基百科超链接网络的HaystackCraft基准，包含多跳问题，并评估了不同检索策略（稀疏、稠密、混合和基于图）对干扰因素组成、haystack排序和下游LLM性能的影响。此外，还将NIAH扩展到动态的、LLM依赖的设置，模拟agentic操作。

Result: 实验结果表明，更强的稠密检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰因素，而基于图的重排序可以提高检索效果并减轻有害干扰因素。在agentic测试中，即使是像Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-5这样的先进模型也会因自我生成的干扰因素而遭受级联失败，或难以执行早期停止。

Conclusion: 本文强调了agentic长文本推理中持续存在的挑战，并将HaystackCraft确立为未来进展的有价值的试验平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [3] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大型语言模型在词形还原任务中的能力，无需微调即可达到最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏关于大型语言模型在词形还原任务中有效性的证据。

Method: 通过实验比较大型语言模型与传统监督方法在 12 种不同形态复杂度的语言上的性能。

Result: 大型语言模型在大多数语言中，通过直接生成上下文中的词形，无需事先微调，即可达到最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在词形还原任务中具有强大的能力，尤其是在缺乏监督数据的情况下。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [4] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的自动语音识别（ASR）评估指标LASER，旨在更公平地评估不同语言的ASR系统，减少对语义影响不大的形态和句法差异的过度惩罚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR评估指标如词错误率（WER）会不公平地惩罚形态和句法上的细微差别，而这些差异并不显著改变句子语义。

Method: 利用最先进的LLM的上下文学习能力，通过带有详细示例的提示来学习。使用Gemini 2.5 Pro的印地语LASER评分与人工标注的相关性高达94%。

Result: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro的印地语LASER评分与人工标注的相关性高达94%。印地语示例在分析其他印度语言（如马拉地语、卡纳达语和马拉雅拉姆语）的错误方面也很有效。较小的LLM（如Llama 3）可以在从参考和ASR预测中导出的词对示例上进行微调，以预测应应用哪种惩罚，准确率接近89%。

Conclusion: LASER是一种有效的自动语音识别评估指标，可以更准确地评估不同语言的ASR系统，并且可以通过微调较小的LLM来实现更高的效率。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

### [5] [Meaningful Pose-Based Sign Language Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07453)
*Zifan Jiang,Colin Leong,Amit Moryossef,Anne Göhring,Annette Rios,Oliver Cory,Maksym Ivashechkin,Neha Tarigopula,Biao Zhang,Rico Sennrich,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究旨在评估手语表达，以人体骨骼姿势的形式呈现。研究涵盖了基于关键点距离、基于嵌入和基于反向翻译的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对手语表达进行有意义的评估

Method: 通过自动元评估和人工相关性研究，展示了不同场景下不同指标之间的权衡。

Result: 研究结果展示了不同指标在不同场景下的优劣。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个实用且可复现的姿势评估工具包，为手语翻译或生成系统的开发和评估提供了一种方法。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

### [6] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)
*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于rubric和anchor引导的CoT提示方法，该方法模仿人工编码员的训练过程，用于测量民粹主义的观念内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本分析方法成本高、耗时，且难以跨语言、跨背景和大规模语料库扩展。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用全球民粹主义数据库（GPD），通过提示LLM使用与训练人工编码员相同的文档来指导模型的推理，从而复制人工编码员的训练过程。

Result: 该领域特定的提示策略使LLM能够达到与专家人工编码员相当的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 证明了LLM能够驾驭民粹主义细致的、对背景敏感的方面。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

### [7] [MAPRO: Recasting Multi-Agent Prompt Optimization as Maximum a Posteriori Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07475)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MAPRO的框架，用于优化多智能体系统中每个智能体的prompt，从而提升整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统可以通过协调不同角色的智能体来超越单个智能体，但prompt设计和系统不稳定带来了挑战。现有的自动prompt设计方法主要集中在单智能体上，缺乏对多智能体prompt优化的研究。

Method: MAPRO框架包含四个阶段，将prompt优化问题建模为最大后验概率（MAP）推断问题，并使用一种语言引导的max-product belief propagation算法求解。此外，采用了一种拓扑感知的改进机制，结合执行反馈和下游归因来选择性地更新智能体的prompt。

Result: 在各种任务的基准测试中，MAPRO取得了最先进的性能，始终优于手动设计的基线和最近的自动化替代方案。

Conclusion: MAPRO不仅在性能上有所突破，而且其基于MAP的公式也为未来构建更可靠、更规范的多智能体系统提供了一般性指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [8] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade通过预测查询状态和异步KV缓存过滤，在不牺牲模型性能的情况下，消除了顺序依赖性，显著降低了LLM在测试时缩放（TTS）场景下的时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放通过长链式思维提升LLM推理能力，但线性增长的KV缓存加剧了内存瓶颈。现有的查询感知稀疏解码方法受限于顺序依赖的页面过滤和粗粒度的token选择，在高并发和长链式思维场景下效率降低。

Method: AsyncSpade包含两个核心组件：轻量级时序回归模块，用于预测下一个token的查询状态；异步和解耦框架，将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离，通过异步性将token级KV选择与前向推理计算重叠。

Result: AsyncSpade在A100节点上，与最先进的基线方法相比，TPOT降低超过20%，与Qwen3-8B和Qwen3-32B模型上的全注意力相比，TPOT降低至少50%，同时在各种TTS基准测试中达到或超过它们的准确性。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade是第一个在不牺牲模型性能的情况下消除顺序依赖性的方法，通过完全重叠KV缓存操作与推理管线，实现了理论上的最佳时间开销。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

### [9] [Can Lessons From Human Teams Be Applied to Multi-Agent Systems? The Role of Structure, Diversity, and Interaction Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07488)
*Rasika Muralidharan,Jaewoon Kwak,Jisun An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的多智能体系统（MAS）中的团队动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于对MAS中团队动力学探索的不足，并借鉴了人类团队科学。

Method: 提出了一个多智能体框架，用于考察团队科学的核心方面：结构、多样性和互动动态。在四个任务上评估团队表现：常识问答、策略问答、社交智商和潜在隐性仇恨。

Result: 研究结果表明，扁平化团队的表现往往优于层级化团队，而多样性的影响则较为复杂。访谈表明，智能体对团队表现过于自信，但任务后的反思揭示了对合作的欣赏以及整合方面的挑战，包括有限的对话协调。

Conclusion: 总结了扁平化团队更优，多样性影响复杂，智能体协作存在挑战。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

### [10] [Can Speech LLMs Think while Listening?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07497)
*Yi-Jen Shih,Desh Raj,Chunyang Wu,Wei Zhou,SK Bong,Yashesh Gaur,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli,Mike Seltzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了CoT微调对多流语音LLM的影响，并提出了通过在用户查询结束前开始推理来减少推理延迟的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音LLM在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，而CoT prompting或微调已被证明可以显著提高基于文本的LLM的推理能力。

Method: 1. 研究CoT微调对多流语音LLM的影响；2. 提出基于熵的指标“问题完整性”来指导模型开始推理的最佳时间；3. 使用DPO在基于拒绝抽样的偏好数据上进行优化。

Result: 1. 在一系列口语推理任务中，文本空间中的推理使语音LLM的准确率平均提高了2.4倍；2. 在相同的延迟条件下，与基于启发式的方法相比，在ARC-Easy上的准确率提高了4%；3. 在不损失准确性的情况下，延迟降低了70%。

Conclusion: 通过CoT微调和优化推理起始时间，可以显著提高语音LLM的推理能力，并降低延迟。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

### [11] [When Thoughts Meet Facts: Reusable Reasoning for Long-Context LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07499)
*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为ToTAL的框架，通过使用思想模板来改进长文本语言模型(LCLM)在知识密集型多跳推理方面的表现。该框架利用从先前问题解决轨迹中提取的可重用思想缓存，指导LCLM如何组合证据和进行多跳推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LCLM虽然可以处理大量文本，但简单地将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法捕捉证据之间的联系。

Method: 该论文提出了思想模板，将推理重塑为可重用的思想缓存，并通过自然语言反馈迭代优化从训练数据中提取的模板。

Result: 在各种基准测试和LCLM系列中，该方法在基于检索和无检索的设置中均优于强大的基线。优化的模板可以被提炼成更小的开源模型。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的ToTAL框架能够有效提升LCLM在知识密集型多跳推理方面的能力，并且具有广泛的适用性和透明的推理重用性。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

*Rayyan Merchant,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种用于塔吉克-波斯语对音译的序列到序列模型，该模型在所有可用数据集上进行训练，并在不同领域取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于书写标准的差异，塔吉克斯坦和其它使用波斯语的地区之间的书面交流受阻。以往的机器音译模型由于数据集的限制，缺乏在不同领域中的通用性。

Method: 该研究提出了一种新的序列到序列模型，用于塔吉克-波斯语的音译，并在所有可用的数据集上进行了训练，同时提供了两个新的数据集。

Result: 该模型在波斯语到塔吉克语的音译中，chrF++得分达到87.91，标准化CER得分为0.05；在塔吉克语到波斯语的音译中，chrF++得分达到92.28，标准化CER得分为0.04。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的模型在不同领域中取得了最先进的结果，为塔吉克-波斯语的音译任务提供了更清晰的理解，并建立了全面的可比较的领先基准。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

*Jaeseong Lee,seung-won hwang,Aurick Qiao,Gabriele Oliaro,Ye Wang,Samyam Rajbhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的长文本推测解码模型OWL，并在LongSpecBench上进行了评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法在长文本上下文中表现不佳，甚至会降低生成速度

Method: 1. 基于LSTM的起草者，仅以最后一个token状态为条件，使其能够推广到各种长度；2. 验证器中使用特殊token [SPEC]，为起草者生成更丰富的表示；3. 结合树和非树解码方法的混合算法

Result: OWL在长文本输入上的接受长度比EAGLE3高约5倍

Conclusion: 发布了所有代码和数据集，以推进未来的研究

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何提升小型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在图表理解任务中作为自动评估器的性能，以解决资源受限环境下的应用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型LVLMs在图表理解任务中表现出潜力，但小型模型性能较差，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了两种方法：多标准提示（将多个评估标准整合到单个查询中）和领域自适应迁移学习（在图表数据集上微调2B参数的LVLM，创建ChartJudge）。

Result: 实验表明，多标准提示暴露了模型的鲁棒性差距，导致大型模型性能下降。而小型LVLM（ChartJudge）能有效迁移知识，成为更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 通过对图表类型和查询复杂性的细粒度分析，为模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡提供了可操作的见解，从而实现了图表推理任务的可扩展、低成本评估。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 研究如何在移动平台上部署自然语言处理（NLP）模型，重点关注模型的适应性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动平台上部署NLP模型需要在内存和计算方面保持高效的同时，适应不同的应用。研究轻量级BERT类似编码器的预精调策略，以增强其在命名实体识别（NER）和文本分类这两个基本NLP任务中的适应性。

Method: 提出了一种基于任务主导LoRA模块的多任务预精调框架，该框架使用带有模块化适配器的单个共享编码器主干。

Result: 在21个下游任务上的实验表明，NER平均提高了0.8%，文本分类平均提高了8.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法对于通用的移动NLP应用有效。

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算语言学分析，研究了与疫情相关的在线讨论，旨在区分健康虚假信息和事实性信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是了解语言如何区分健康虚假信息和事实性信息，从而应对数字健康虚假信息。

Method: 该研究使用了三个语料库：COVID-19 虚假叙述、一般 COVID-19 内容和猴痘相关帖子，并分析了可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言的使用。

Result: 研究结果表明，COVID-19 虚假信息的可读性得分明显较低，并且包含的与恐惧相关或说服性术语的频率是其他数据集的两倍以上。它也极少使用感叹号，这与猴痘内容中更情绪化的风格形成对比。

Conclusion: 研究表明，虚假信息采用了一种故意复杂的修辞风格，其中嵌入了情感线索，这种组合可能会增强其感知可信度。该研究强调了可能有助于检测工作的语言指标，并为网络媒体环境中的公共卫生信息传递策略和危机沟通的理论模型提供了信息。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个使用LLM辅助构建人工语言的模块化系统，该系统从音系、形态句法、词汇、正字法和语法手册等方面进行构建，并可用于低资源语言的翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究的动机有两个：一是为人工语言的创造提供有趣的工具；二是探索LLM对语言的认知，包括对语言和语言概念的理解程度。

Method: 该系统首先使用agentic方法创建目标语言的音系，然后将英语句子翻译成形态句法标记，再利用音系模型和语素构建词典，接着为语言设计正字法，最后编写语法手册。

Result: 不同LLM和不同语言规范之间存在能力差距，系统更容易处理常见的语言模式。在低资源语言翻译方面的结果目前 основном 是负面的，但有证据表明改进后的系统可能带来实际收益。

Conclusion: 该系统为人工语言的构建提供了一个有趣的工具，并初步探索了LLM在语言理解和低资源语言翻译方面的潜力。

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）中输入词汇表征的结构，以及该结构在训练过程中的演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解语言模型的输入嵌入向量是如何构建的，以及它们如何随着训练而变化。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，将两个开源模型（Pythia 12B 和 OLMo 7B）的输入和输出嵌入的几何结构与语义、句法和基于频率的指标相关联。

Result: 研究结果表明：1) 在训练过程中，词汇嵌入几何结构迅速收敛，与一系列语义和句法特征高度相关；2) 高频词和功能词的嵌入比词汇词和低频词更快地收敛到它们的最终向量，后者保留了与随机初始化的偏差。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了输入嵌入如何围绕语言结构组织的动态轨迹，揭示了词频和功能的不同作用。这些发现推动了对词汇几何结构演变如何促进模型训练期间特定能力提升的深入研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with clinical coding, especially with hierarchically close codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate clinical coding is essential, but LLMs have limitations, particularly with hierarchically similar codes. Existing datasets also have limitations.

Method: Prompt engineering and small-scale fine-tuning are used to improve accuracy. Clinical code verification is introduced.

Result: Lightweight interventions improve accuracy. Verification is effective for improving medical coding.

Conclusion: Verification is a reliable step toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否能遵守访问控制策略，避免产生无限制的回复。

Method: 创建了一个新的数据集，扩展了Spider和BIRD文本到SQL数据集，并修改为具有实际的PostgreSQL基于角色的策略，在表和列级别进行修改。比较了三种设计：(i)零或少样本提示，(ii)一个两步生成器-验证器pipeline，检查SQL策略，(iii)LoRA微调模型，直接学习权限意识。

Result: 显式验证(两步框架)提高了拒绝精度，降低了错误许可。微调在安全性和实用性之间取得了更好的平衡。更长更复杂的策略会降低所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 发布了rbac增强的数据集和代码。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

TL;DR: Ryt AI is an LLM-native agentic framework powering Ryt Bank, enabling financial transactions via natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a primary banking interface using conversational AI, unlike previous advisory roles.

Method: Using a closed-source LLM (ILMU) and four agents with task-specific LoRA adapters, hosted within the bank's infrastructure.

Result: A regulator-approved natural-language interface reliably supports core financial operations.

Conclusion: Natural-language interfaces can reliably support core financial operations under strict governance.

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的缓存淘汰框架，旨在解决长文本大语言模型中因缓存所有键值对而导致的内存开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的缓存淘汰方法通常使用启发式方法，根据累积的注意力权重对token进行排序，但忽略了它们对注意力输出的实际影响。

Method: 该论文提出的Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache)框架，将缓存淘汰视为一个分层结构的剪枝问题，并使用Optimal Brain Damage (OBD)理论来量化token的显著性，通过测量删除token引起的注意力输出扰动来评估其重要性。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，用OBCache的输出感知分数替换现有工作中的启发式分数，可以持续提高长文本的准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache通过考虑注意力权重、值状态和注意力输出的信息，增强了现有的淘汰策略，从而提高了长文本处理的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token概率（TP）的偏见测量方法被批评脱离实际应用和危害。因此，本文旨在探索自然语言推理（NLI）作为一种更现实的替代方案。

Method: 通过测试自然语言推理（NLI）作为偏见指标，并将其结果与token概率（TP）指标进行对比分析。

Result: NLI和TP偏见评估表现出显著差异，NLI指标之间以及NLI和TP指标之间的相关性非常低。NLI指标更有可能检测到“欠去偏见”的情况，但对反刻板印象句子的措辞更为敏感。

Conclusion: token概率和自然语言推理并非在所有情况下都是“更好”的偏见指标。为了全面评估语言模型，建议结合使用TP、NLI和下游偏见评估。

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的AI宪法和模型规范面临内部冲突和覆盖不足的挑战。

Method: 通过生成强制在相互冲突的基于价值的原则之间进行权衡的场景来压力测试当前的模型规范。使用全面的分类法，我们生成了不同的价值权衡场景，在这些场景中，模型必须在无法同时满足的一对合法原则之间做出选择。

Result: 在主要的提供商（Anthropic、OpenAI、Google、xAI）的12个前沿LLM的响应中，我们发现了超过70,000个表现出显著行为差异的案例。实证表明，模型行为的高度差异强烈预测了模型规范中潜在的问题。

Conclusion: 通过定性分析，我们提供了当前模型规范中的许多示例问题，例如直接矛盾和几个原则的解释模糊性。此外，我们生成的数据集还揭示了我们研究的所有前沿模型的明确对齐错误案例和假阳性拒绝案例。最后，我们还提供了这些模型的价值优先级模式和差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

Result: CADET在实验中表现出优越的性能。

Conclusion: 因果先验知识在推进通用仇恨言论检测方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

*Shuo Yu,Mingyue Cheng,Daoyu Wang,Qi Liu,Zirui Liu,Ze Guo,Xiaoyu Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemWeaver weaves user's textual history into a hierarchical memory for deeply personalized generation, capturing temporal evolution and semantic relationships of interests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing approaches offer only shallow personalization by treating user history as a flat list of texts, failing to model the dynamic nature of user interests.

Method: MemWeaver builds two complementary memory components: behavioral memory (specific user actions) and cognitive memory (long-term preferences), integrating temporal and semantic information at different abstraction levels.

Result: Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP) benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver.

Conclusion: MemWeaver effectively captures both concrete behaviors and abstracted traits of users, enabling LLMs to reason over them for improved personalization.

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is
available\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph RAG lacks deep structured reasoning for complex multi-hop QA, leading to incomplete evidence and error accumulation.

Method: SubQRAG decomposes complex questions into verifiable sub-questions, retrieves relevant triples, and dynamically expands the graph when needed. It aggregates triples into a graph memory for traceable evidence.

Result: SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements on three multi-hop QA benchmarks, especially in Exact Match scores.

Conclusion: SubQRAG enhances reasoning depth by using a sub-question-driven framework that decomposes questions, retrieves relevant triples, and dynamically expands the knowledge graph, leading to improved performance in multi-hop QA.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于大型语言模型（LLM）的多语言知识图谱补全（MKGC）框架，该框架利用多语言共享知识来显着提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MKGC研究未能充分利用LLM的多语言能力，并忽略了跨语言知识的可共享性。

Method: 该框架包含两个组件：知识级分组混合专家（KL-GMoE）和迭代实体重排序（IER）。KL-GMoE有效地建模共享知识，而IER显着增强了其利用率。

Result: 实验结果表明，与SOTA MKGC方法相比，该框架在Hits@1、Hits@3和Hits@10指标上分别提高了5.47%、3.27%和1.01%。

Conclusion: 本文构建了一个包含5种语言的mKG数据集，并通过综合对比实验验证了该框架的有效性，揭示了在未见和不平衡语言设置中知识共享的特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

*Fu Chen,Peng Wang,Xiyin Li,Wen Li,Shichi Lei,Dongdong Xiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ToolExpander框架，用于提升资源受限的大语言模型使用工具的能力，尤其是在较弱的小规模模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在小规模模型上表现不佳，且容易发生训练崩溃。

Method: 引入动态多轮硬采样和自示例思考。

Result: ToolExpander显著提高了LLM的工具使用能力，增强了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: ToolExpander框架有效提升了小规模LLM的工具使用能力和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

*Tianci Liu,Ran Xu,Tony Yu,Ilgee Hong,Carl Yang,Tuo Zhao,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了OpenRubrics，一个大规模的(prompt, rubric)对集合，用于训练rubric生成和基于rubric的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型依赖于标量或成对判断，无法捕捉人类偏好的多方面性。Rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) 使用结构化的自然语言标准来捕捉响应质量的多个维度，但生成可靠且可扩展的rubrics仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 引入了对比Rubric生成 (CRG)，通过对比首选和拒绝的响应来推导出硬性规则（显式约束）和原则（隐式质量）。通过强制执行偏好标签一致性，使用拒绝抽样来删除噪声rubrics，从而进一步提高可靠性。

Result: 在多个奖励建模基准测试中，基于rubric的奖励模型Rubric-RM超过了强大的大小匹配基线6.8%。这些收益转移到指令跟随和生物医学基准测试的策略模型。

Conclusion: Rubrics提供了可扩展的对齐信号，缩小了昂贵的人工评估和自动奖励建模之间的差距，为LLM对齐启用了一种新的原则驱动范例。

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

*Runyang You,Yongqi Li,Meng Liu,Wenjie Wang,Liqiang Nie,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对潜在推理模型并行测试时间缩放（TTS）的方法，通过引入不确定性驱动的随机抽样策略和潜在奖励模型（LatentRM）来实现有效的轨迹选择和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索潜在推理模型是否能像显式CoT一样从并行TTS中受益，并解决连续空间中缺乏抽样机制和概率信号的问题。

Method: 提出了两种不确定性驱动的随机抽样策略：蒙特卡洛Dropout和加性高斯噪声，并设计了一个潜在奖励模型（LatentRM），通过逐步对比目标进行训练，以评分和指导潜在推理。

Result: 实验结果表明，两种抽样策略都能有效地随着计算资源的增加而扩展，并表现出不同的探索动态，而LatentRM能够实现有效的轨迹选择。

Conclusion: 本文的研究为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了一个新的方向。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在回答问题前会进行推理，但在仅提供选项的情况下，它们也能成功解决多项选择题。研究表明，即使没有问题，LLM 也能仅凭选项成功解答问题，这引发了 LLM 是否真正理解问题的担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探讨大型语言模型在仅凭选项的情况下解决多项选择题时，其推理过程是否肤浅，以及这种仅凭选项成功的现象是否总是存在问题。

Method: 研究方法包括让推理型 LLM 在完整输入和仅选项输入下解决多项选择题，并通过测试时间推理来提高准确性。此外，还分析了推理轨迹的长度和可信度，以评估 LLM 使用的策略。

Result: 研究结果表明，测试时间推理在完整输入和仅选项输入下都能提高准确性，但仅选项输入的成功并不受推理轨迹长度的影响。此外，研究发现 LLM 在仅选项输入下会使用诸如推断缺失问题等策略。

Conclusion: 研究结论认为，不能简单地认为仅凭选项成功的现象都是缺陷，并讨论了如何利用推理轨迹来区分有问题的数据和不太有问题的推理。研究挑战了仅凭部分输入成功总是有问题的观点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统的方法，用于自动将非结构化的工具集合重构为结构化的工具库，以解决工具增强的大型语言模型在领域特定工具稀缺和工具检索挑战的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域特定工具的稀缺性阻碍了工具增强推理的广泛应用。现有方法在创建工具时面临可扩展性瓶颈，因为随着生成工具数量的增加，存储在非结构化集合中会导致检索挑战。

Method: 该系统首先生成离散的、特定于任务的工具，并将它们聚类成语义连贯的主题。在每个集群中，引入了一个多代理框架来整合分散的功能：一个代码代理重构代码以提取共享逻辑并创建通用的聚合工具，而一个审查代理确保这些聚合工具保持原始集合的完整功能。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了工具检索准确性和多个推理任务的整体推理性能。此外，随着问题特定工具数量的增加，该方法显示出比基线更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够将大量特定问题的工具转换为一小组功能强大的聚合工具，且不损失功能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

*Youliang Yuan,Qiuyang Mang,Jingbang Chen,Hong Wan,Xiaoyuan Liu,Junjielong Xu,Jen-tse Huang,Wenxuan Wang,Wenxiang Jiao,Pinjia He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于结果的奖励在训练用于数学推理的大型语言模型时容易出现奖励漏洞，导致模型推理能力被高估。本文提出了一种面向过程的奖励函数，即 Rubric Reward Model (RRM)，它可以评估整个推理过程，并对逻辑缺陷进行惩罚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于结果的奖励方法在数学推理方面存在问题，因为它无法区分正确的推理过程和通过不合理的推理过程获得的正确答案。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的奖励函数 Rubric Reward Model (RRM)，它通过评估整个推理过程来提供细粒度的、校准的奖励，并明确惩罚逻辑缺陷。

Result: RRM 在四个数学基准测试中始终优于仅基于结果的监督，在 AIME2024 上将 Verified Pass@1024 从 26.7% 提高到 62.6%，并将 Miracle Steps 的发生率降低了 71%。

Conclusion: 奖励解决方案过程对于构建不仅更准确而且更可靠的模型至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型的事实性提升可能会损害安全性对齐，因为模型中重叠的组件同时编码了幻觉和拒绝信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型(llm)中提高真实性与安全性之间的权衡问题。提高事实准确性通常以削弱拒绝行为为代价。即使是为安全而策划的良性数据集上的微调，也会因同样的原因降低对齐效果。

Method: 利用稀疏自动编码器分离与拒绝相关的特征与幻觉特征，并通过子空间正交化在微调期间保持拒绝行为。这种方法可以防止幻觉增加，同时保持安全对齐。

Result: 在常识推理任务和有害基准(AdvBench和StrongReject)上评估了该方法。结果表明，该方法保留了拒绝行为和任务效用，减轻了真实性与安全性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，提高大型语言模型的事实性可能会损害安全性对齐，并提出了一种在微调期间分离拒绝相关特征的方法，以缓解这种权衡。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Motivation: 先前的方法依赖于表示分类并忽略实例关系，导致误差传播。

Method: 构建了一个具有标签知识传播的实例关系学习网络，以消除误差传播。利用类信息学习实例之间的交互关系，以在少量标记的（支持集）和未标记的（查询集）实例之间传播标签知识。开发了一种双重关系增强损失，以优化支持和查询级别的关系强度，从而提高性能。

Result: 在 1-shot 场景中，平均 AUC 提高了 9.54%，Macro-F1 提高了 11.19%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法优于强大的基线模型。

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 现实应用需要持续的多轮交互，但模型会逐渐偏离目标。

Method: 将漂移形式化为模型与参考模型之间的KL散度，并提出一个循环模型将其解释为有界随机过程。

Result: 实验表明，漂移表现出稳定的噪声限制均衡，简单的提醒干预可以有效减少差异。

Conclusion: 多轮漂移可以被理解为可控的均衡现象，为研究和缓解扩展交互中的上下文漂移提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

*Shuichiro Haruta,Kazunori Matsumoto,Zhi Li,Yanan Wang,Mori Kurokawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种旋转约束补偿方法，以解决大型语言模型（LLM）结构化剪枝引入的误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在海量数据集上训练，并在其表示空间中积累了丰富的语义知识。相比之下，剪枝通常只使用少量校准数据进行，这使得输出不匹配不可避免。直接最小二乘拟合虽然可以减少这种误差，但它往往会过度拟合到有限的校准集，从而破坏性地修改预训练权重。

Method: 在旋转约束下更新剪枝参数。这种约束更新保留了输出表示的几何形状（即范数和内积），并同时将剪枝后的子空间与原始输出重新对齐。此外，在旋转约束补偿中，移除对输出主方向贡献大的分量会使误差恢复变得困难。由于具有大方差的输入维度强烈影响这些主方向，因此我们设计了一种方差感知重要性分数，以确保这些维度优先保留在剪枝模型中。通过将该评分规则与旋转约束更新相结合，该方法有效地补偿了误差，同时以保留几何形状的方式保留了可能更重要的组件。

Result: 在实验中，我们将该方法应用于 LLaMA-7B，并在 WikiText-2 和多个语言理解基准上对其进行评估。结果表明，与现有基线相比，该方法在困惑度和任务准确性方面始终表现更好。

Conclusion: 提出了一种有效的剪枝补偿方法，可以在保留几何形状的同时，有效地补偿误差。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain

*Peilin Wu,Mian Zhang,Kun Wan,Wentian Zhao,Kaiyu He,Xinya Du,Zhiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces HiPRAG, a new training methodology for Agentic RAG that uses fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process rewards in RL training to improve search efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suboptimal search behaviors like over-search and under-search in Agentic RAG lead to inefficiencies and unreliable outputs. Current training methods lack the fine-grained control needed to address these issues.

Method: The paper introduces Hierarchical Process Rewards for Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), which incorporates a fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. It evaluates the necessity of each search decision and applies a hierarchical reward function based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps.

Result: Experiments show that HiPRAG achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B) on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models, while also improving search efficiency by reducing over-search and under-search rates.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final outcome, and shows the potential of fine-grained control through RL for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning for search agents. HiPRAG also shows good generalizability across various RL algorithms, model families, sizes, and types.

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

*Eric Hanchen Jiang,Guancheng Wan,Sophia Yin,Mengting Li,Yuchen Wu,Xiao Liang,Xinfeng Li,Yizhou Sun,Wei Wang,Kai-Wei Chang,Ying Nian Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成框架，称为引导拓扑扩散 (GTD)，用于multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)的通信拓扑优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的框架通常依赖于静态或手工制作的拓扑，这无法适应不同的任务需求，导致简单问题token消耗过多或复杂问题出现性能瓶颈

Method: GTD受到条件离散图扩散模型的启发，将拓扑综合构建为一个迭代构建过程。在每一步中，生成都由一个轻量级的代理模型引导，该模型预测多目标奖励（例如，准确性、效用、成本），从而实现实时、无梯度优化，从而实现任务自适应拓扑

Result: 实验表明，该框架可以生成高度任务自适应、稀疏和高效的通信拓扑，显著优于LLM代理协作中的现有方法

Conclusion: GTD 能够更好地驾驭复杂的设计权衡

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的跨语言生成检索框架MGR-CSC，通过跨语言语义压缩统一语义等价的多语言关键词，从而对齐语义并压缩标识符空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成信息检索在单语场景中表现出色，但在多语言检索中存在跨语言标识符错位和标识符膨胀的问题。

Method: 提出了一种动态多步约束解码策略。MGR-CSC通过分配一致的标识符来改进跨语言对齐，并通过减少冗余来提高解码效率。

Result: 在mMarco100k上提高了6.83%，在mNQ320k上提高了4.77%，同时分别减少了74.51%和78.2%的文档标识符长度。

Conclusion: MGR-CSC在跨语言检索中实现了出色的检索精度，并有效减少了文档标识符的长度。

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 AdaSwitch 的新方法，该方法动态地结合了 token 级别的 on-policy 和 off-policy 生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型 (SLM) 对于具有严格延迟和计算约束的应用程序至关重要，但实现高性能仍然具有挑战性。知识蒸馏 (KD) 可以从大型教师模型转移能力，但现有方法存在权衡：off-policy 蒸馏提供高质量的监督，但引入了训练-推理不匹配，而 on-policy 方法保持一致性，但依赖于低质量的学生输出。

Method: AdaSwitch 允许学生首先探索自己的预测，然后根据实时质量评估有选择地整合教师指导。

Result: 在三个数据集和两个师生 LLM 对上的实验表明，AdaSwitch 始终提高准确性，为提炼 SLM 提供了一种实用有效的方法，并具有可接受的额外开销。

Conclusion: AdaSwitch 是一种用于提炼 SLM 的实用有效的方法，它始终提高准确性，并具有可接受的额外开销。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Method: 该方法通过基准测试 24 个双向语言对在多个领域上的翻译质量，并提出了一种混合偏见检测流程，该流程集成了基于规则的启发式方法、语义相似性过滤和基于 LLM 的验证。

Result: 该研究引入了一个高质量、带有偏见注释的数据集，该数据集基于对 1,439 个翻译-参考对的人工评估。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，Translation Tangles 框架和数据集能够有效评估开源 LLM 的翻译质量和公平性，并为解决 LLM 中的偏见问题提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）中的“过度思考”问题，即模型在简单任务上进行不必要的推理，导致计算浪费且准确率没有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对过度思考的分析 поверхностный，缺乏对LLM内部机制的深入了解。

Method: 提出了一个名为TRACE的系统性、细粒度的LLM思维过程分析器，通过将思维过程分解为最小的完整子思维，并推断子思维之间的关系，构建细粒度的思维演进图。

Result: 发现开放权重思维模型中存在两种主要模式——“探索者”和“延迟着陆”，表明过度验证和过度探索是LLM过度思考的主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 基于思维结构，提出了一个基于效用的过度思考定义，超越了基于长度的指标，为原则性的过度思考管理提供了实用的指导方针。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海事目标检测面临小目标尺寸和标记真实RGB数据限制的挑战。

Method: 采用RT-DETR，结合多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择和合成与真实训练样本之间的智能权重。

Result: 该系统保持实时性能，即使在实际限制下也能提供完整的Python鲁棒海事检测管道。验证了每个模块的贡献以及系统在极端光照或海洋条件下的故障处理能力。

Conclusion: 组件分析量化了每个架构模块的贡献，并探讨了它们的相互作用。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DynamicEval，一个用于评估文本到视频模型在动态相机运动下的性能的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频评估基准在动态相机运动和视频级别评估方面存在局限性。

Method: 1) 提出了DynamicEval基准，包含强调动态相机运动的提示和人工标注。2) 提出了背景一致性指标，利用物体误差图来校正VBench运动平滑度指标的失效情况。3) 提出了前景一致性指标，通过跟踪物体实例内的点及其邻居来评估物体保真度。

Result: 提出的指标在视频级别和模型级别上与人类偏好实现了更强的相关性。

Conclusion: DynamicEval是一个更全面的基准，用于评估动态相机运动下的文本到视频模型。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

*Sofia Kirsanova,Yao-Yi Chiang,Weiwei Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合LayoutLMv3和GPT-4o的方法，用于从历史地图图例中提取符号及其描述，以提高地图的可搜索性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图图例对于解释地图符号至关重要，但其不一致的布局和非结构化格式使得自动提取具有挑战性。现有工作主要集中在分割或通用光学字符识别（OCR），很少有方法能有效地将图例符号与其对应的描述以结构化的方式匹配。

Method: 该方法结合了LayoutLMv3用于布局检测，并使用GPT-4o通过上下文学习来检测和链接图例项目及其描述，通过边界框预测实现。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用结构化JSON提示的GPT-4o优于基线，实现了88%的F-1值和85%的IoU。同时揭示了提示设计、示例计数和布局对齐如何影响性能。

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展的、布局感知的图例解析，并提高了各种视觉风格的历史地图的索引和可搜索性。

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various
visual styles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 RISP 的 RED 扩展算法，旨在提高收敛速度和图像重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法侧重于设计复杂的图像先验以提高重建质量，而将加速收敛留给启发式方法。

Method: 结合了用于快速收敛的重启惯性和用于高质量重建的基于分数的图像先验。

Result: 证明了 RISP 比 RED 具有更快的平稳点收敛速度，并且导出了相关的连续时间动力系统。

Conclusion: RISP 能够在实现高质量重建的同时实现快速收敛。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图像净化 (IP) 策略的创新去噪框架，以解决超低剂量 CT (uLDCT) 去噪中的数据不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: uLDCT 显著降低了辐射暴露，但引入了严重的噪声和伪影，并导致 uLDCT 和正常剂量 CT (NDCT) 图像对之间存在明显的空间错位。这给直接应用在合成噪声或对齐数据上训练的现有去噪网络带来了挑战。

Method: 首先，构建真实的临床 uLDCT 肺部数据集。然后，提出了一种图像净化策略，该策略生成结构对齐的 uLDCT-NDCT 图像对，为网络训练提供高质量的数据基础。在此基础上，提出了频域流匹配 (FFM) 模型，该模型与 IP 策略协同工作，以出色地保持去噪图像的解剖结构完整性。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上的实验表明，IP 策略显著提高了多种主流去噪模型在 uLDCT 任务上的性能。所提出的 FFM 模型与 IP 策略相结合，在解剖结构保持方面取得了最先进 (SOTA) 的结果。

Conclusion: 本研究为实际 uLDCT 去噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型使用的增长，对确保内容归属和来源的水印方法的需求也日益增加。然而，现有的语义水印方案即使在资源受限的对抗环境中仍然存在漏洞。

Method: 通过将水印图像投影到跨互补表示的自然先验上，来抑制水印信号，同时保持视觉保真度。D2RA是一种无需训练的单图像攻击。

Result: 在各种水印方案上的实验表明，该方法能够持续降低水印的可检测性。

Conclusion: 实验结果揭示了当前水印设计的根本弱点。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PickStyle的视频风格迁移框架，该框架利用预训练的视频扩散模型，通过风格适配器和配对的静态图像数据进行训练，以实现视频风格的转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏用于监督的配对视频数据是视频风格迁移的主要挑战。

Method: 该方法通过在条件模块的自注意力层中插入低秩适配器，并利用模拟相机运动的增强技术从配对图像构建合成训练片段，同时引入上下文-风格无分类器引导（CS-CFG）方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在时间一致性、风格保真度和内容保留方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现时间连贯、风格忠实和内容保留的视频转换。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

TL;DR: 现代视频生成模型经常生成违反物理定律的序列。我们探讨了视频-语言模型（VLM）是否可以作为物理合理性的可靠判断者。我们发现现有的VLM难以识别物理违规，暴露了其在时间和因果推理方面的根本局限性。为此，我们引入了TRAVL，它结合了平衡的训练数据集和轨迹感知注意模块，以提高VLM中的运动编码和区分能力。为了更严格地评估物理推理，我们提出了ImplausiBench，这是一个包含300个视频的基准测试，删除了语言偏差并隔离了视觉-时间理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频生成模型经常生成违反直观物理定律的序列，例如物体漂浮、瞬间移动或以违反因果关系的方式变形。虽然人类可以很容易地检测到这种不合理性，但仍然没有鲁棒的方法来定量评估视频中的物理真实性。

Method: 我们引入了TRAVL，这是一种微调方法，它结合了平衡的训练数据集和轨迹感知注意模块，以提高VLM中的运动编码和区分能力。我们提出了ImplausiBench，这是一个包含300个视频（150个真实，150个生成）的基准测试，删除了语言偏差并隔离了视觉-时间理解。

Result: 我们发现现有的VLM难以识别物理违规，暴露了其在时间和因果推理方面的根本局限性。TRAVL和ImplausiBench提供了一个统一的框架，用于探测和改进多模态模型中的物理合理性。

Conclusion: TRAVL和ImplausiBench提供了一个统一的框架，用于探测和改进多模态模型中的物理合理性，从而揭示了视觉-时间理解中一个具有挑战性且未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [56] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用语义光谱空间融合网络 (S3FN)，该网络使用上下文、特定于类别的文本描述来补充 HSI 分类模型的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量训练样本的可用性有限以及光谱数据的高维度，HSI 分类模型容易过度拟合，并且经常面临平衡准确性和计算复杂性的挑战。此外，大多数 HSI 分类模型是单模态的，它们仅依赖于光谱空间数据来学习高维嵌入空间中的决策边界。

Method: 利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 为每个类别标签生成全面的文本描述，这些描述捕捉了它们独特的特征和光谱行为。然后，使用预训练的文本编码器（例如 BERT 或 RoBERTa）将这些描述嵌入到向量空间中，以提取有意义的标签语义，从而实现更好的特征-标签对齐，从而提高分类性能。

Result: 在三个不同的 HSI 基准数据集（Hyperspectral Wood、HyperspectralBlueberries 和 DeepHS-Fruit）上评估了该模型，并报告了显着的性能提升。

Conclusion: 文本语义和光谱空间数据之间存在协同作用，为语义增强的 HSI 分类模型的进一步发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [57] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种针对视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的轻量级且高效的 machine unlearning 框架，名为 Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL)，用于解决 VQA 任务中可能存在的隐私数据泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练视觉-语言模型在 VQA 等任务中表现出色，但可能在训练过程中记忆并泄露敏感信息。现有的 machine unlearning 方法主要针对 LLMs，而 VLMs 由于视觉上下文的存在，情况更为复杂。

Method: 该方法利用跨模态注意力机制，对视觉 tokens 进行编码，将 machine unlearning 信息嵌入到低重要性的视觉 tokens 中，从而在不修改预训练模型参数的情况下实现 machine unlearning。

Result: 实验结果表明，CAGUL 方法在防止隐私泄露的同时，能够保持参考模型的性能，并且与基于微调的基线方法相比，性能更好或相当。

Conclusion: CAGUL 是一种实用且有效的 VLM machine unlearning 解决方案，无需重新训练或修改模型参数。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MaSC的算法，用于从无人机RGB图像中自动计数玉米幼苗，从而实现玉米植株的准确计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工计数劳动强度大、速度慢且容易出错，尤其是在大型或可变田地中。因此，需要一种自动化的玉米幼苗计数方法。

Method: 使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测玉米幼苗，并根据检测结果的空间分布进行行和范围分割，以生成精确的逐行植株计数。

Result: 在2024年夏季苗圃的实地人工计数评估中，该算法与地面实况非常吻合（镶嵌图的R^2=0.616，原始帧的R^2=0.906）。处理83个全分辨率帧仅需60.63秒。

Conclusion: MaSC是一种可扩展、低成本且准确的工具，可用于研究和生产环境中自动玉米植株计数。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

TL;DR: CapsNet在MNIST数据集上表现出色，但速度较慢。本文提出了Quick-CapsNet (QCN)，它通过减少capsule的数量来加速，但略微降低了精度。QCN在MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上的推理速度提高了5倍。此外，还通过使用更强大的解码器来增强QCN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet虽然精度高，但在训练和测试速度方面存在瓶颈，尤其是在需要快速推理的实时应用中。

Method: 提出了Quick-CapsNet (QCN)，它通过减少capsule的数量来实现加速。

Result: QCN在MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上的推理速度提高了5倍，但精度略有下降。通过采用更强大的解码器，QCN得到了进一步的增强。

Conclusion: QCN是CapsNet的一个快速替代方案，可以作为开发快速实时CapsNet应用的起点。

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了 Rectified-CFG++，一个用于rectified flow模型的自适应predictor-corrector引导方法，解决了传统CFG中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 classifier-free guidance (CFG) 应用于 rectified flow (RF) 模型时，会引起严重的离manifold漂移，导致视觉伪影和文本不对齐。

Method: 提出了一种自适应 predictor-corrector 引导，它将 rectified flow 的确定性效率与几何感知条件规则相结合。每个推理步骤首先执行一个有条件的 RF 更新，将样本锚定在学习的传输路径附近，然后应用一个加权的有条件校正，该校正在有条件和无条件速度场之间进行插值。

Result: 在大型文本到图像模型（Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina）上的大量实验表明，Rectified-CFG++ 在 MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic 和 T2I-CompBench 等基准数据集上始终优于标准 CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++ 能够保证生成结果的稳定性和高质量，在文生图任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

Motivation: 利用大型多模态模型在图像和视频质量评估方面的进展，探索其在3D资产领域的应用。现有技术在点云质量评估方面仍有不足。

Method: 构建了一个名为PIT-QMM的新型LMM，它可以端到端地处理文本、图像和点云，以预测质量分数。

Result: 该方法在流行的基准测试中显著优于现有技术，并且需要的训练迭代次数更少。该框架还支持失真定位和识别。

Conclusion: 该研究为模型的可解释性和交互性开辟了一条新道路。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要集中在对帧序列的时空方面进行建模的单流方法。最近的研究已转向双流方法，该方法学习动作特征以增强动作分割性能。

Method: 提出了双流对齐网络（DSA Net），该网络包含一个时间上下文（TC）块，该块使用交叉注意力和基于量子的动作引导调制（Q-ActGM）融合互补信息。提出了双流对齐损失，它包含三个组成部分：关系一致性、跨层对比和循环一致性重建损失。

Result: DSA Net 在 GTEA、Breakfast、50Salads 和 EgoProcel 等多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该研究引入了一个用于动作分割的混合量子-经典机器学习框架，并通过大量消融研究证明了每个组件的有效性。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

*Yanjie Pan,Qingdong He,Lidong Wang,Bo Peng,Mingmin Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视频虚拟试穿方法OIE，该方法基于首帧服装替换，通过图像的服装迁移模型替换首帧服装，再利用姿势和mask信息引导视频生成模型合成剩余帧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的双分支结构在基于U-Net的扩散模型中取得了显著成功，但将其应用于基于Diffusion Transformer的扩散模型仍然具有挑战性。服装参考分支的潜在空间特征需要添加或修改主干网络，导致大量可训练参数。服装的潜在空间特征缺乏固有的时间特性，因此需要额外的学习。

Method: 采用基于首帧服装替换的虚拟试穿策略OIE，首先使用图像的服装迁移模型替换初始帧中的服装，然后在编辑后的第一帧的内容控制下，利用姿势和mask信息来引导视频生成模型按顺序合成剩余帧。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持领先性能的同时，实现了卓越的参数效率和计算效率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的OIE方法能够有效地解决视频虚拟试穿中参数效率和计算效率的问题，并在Diffusion Transformer上取得了良好的效果。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的个性化扩散模型方法，通过在推理过程中利用IP-Adapter自动生成的mask，将图像token限制在主体上，使文本提示更多地关注图像的其余部分，从而提高主体与提示的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化扩散模型在生成包含特定主题的新图像时，容易出现仅重现主题图像而忽略文本提示的问题。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter自动生成的mask，在第二次pass中mask图像token，限制其只关注主体，使文本提示关注图像的其余部分。

Result: 该方法在描述地点和位置的文本提示下，能准确地描绘主体，并明确地匹配提示，展示出高的提示和源图像对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法优于其他测试时间个性化方法，能更好地对齐prompt和源图像。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

Abstract: In layout design for advertisements and web pages, balancing visual appeal
and communication efficiency is crucial. This study examines automated text box
placement in incomplete layouts, comparing a standard Transformer-based method,
a small Vision and Language Model (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM

Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models
generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating
richer appearance information. However, all methods face challenges with very
small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits
of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像配准中表现出卓越的性能，但它们的解码器架构天生容易传播和累积解剖结构错位。

Method: 该模型集成了特征增强残差模块 (FERM) 和双阶段阈值控制迭代 (TCI) 策略。FERM 提取解剖语义特征，学习抑制不相关的特征，并估计最终的变形场。TCI 自适应地确定不同图像的优化迭代次数。

Result: 在三个公共脑 MRI 数据集和一个腹部 CT 数据集上的大量实验表明，TCIP 在准确性方面优于最先进的 (SOTA) 配准网络，同时保持了相当的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数大小。

Conclusion: 通过将 FERM 和 TCI 与现有的配准网络集成，并进一步进行消融研究，验证了这两种方法的有效性，从而评估了 FERM 和 TCI 的通用性。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Motivation: 现有的视频生成模型通常针对固定的输入格式进行训练，但许多视频工作流程受益于具有不同粒度的用户控制混合，从精确的 4D 对象轨迹和相机路径到粗略的文本提示。

Method: 将任务转换为变分推理以近似组合分布，利用多个视频生成骨干来共同考虑所有任务约束。为了解决优化挑战，将问题分解为在分布的退火序列上逐步最小化 KL 散度，并进一步提出了一种上下文条件分解技术，该技术减少了解空间中的模式以避免局部最优。

Result: 与先前的工作相比，该方法生成了具有改进的可控性、多样性和 3D 一致性的样本。

Conclusion: 该方法可以对特定元素进行高度控制，同时保持未指定元素的多样性。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

Motivation: 基于成对的方法在学习保持局部相似关系的哈希函数方面有效，而基于中心的方法通常通过更有效地捕获全局数据分布来实现卓越的性能。然而，基于中心的方法在建模全局结构方面的优势通常以牺牲利用重要的局部相似性信息为代价。

Method: MLH由两个分支组成：一个强的基于中心的分支和一个较弱的基于成对的分支。通过迭代的互学习过程，基于中心的分支利用了基于成对的分支学习的局部相似性线索。此外，受到混合专家模式的启发，我们引入了一种新的混合哈希专家模块，该模块能够实现有效的跨分支交互，进一步提高了两个分支的性能。

Result: MLH在多个基准数据集上始终优于最先进的哈希方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的哈希方法，通过互学习和混合专家模块，有效地结合了局部相似性和全局数据分布，并在实验中取得了优异的结果。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 电商平台上的产品图像通常包含水印和促销文字等干扰元素，影响用户体验和广告效果。现有的基于扩散的图像修复方法在商业环境中表现不佳，存在物体移除不可靠和领域特定适应性有限的问题。

Method: 该论文提出Repainter框架，该框架结合了空间抠图轨迹优化和群相对策略优化（GRPO），通过调整注意力机制和引入复合奖励机制来生成高质量的修复图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，Repainter在复杂场景中显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Repainter框架能够有效移除电商产品图像中的干扰元素，提高图像质量。

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

TL;DR: SyncHuman: A novel framework combining 2D multiview and 3D native generative models for high-quality clothed human mesh reconstruction from single-view images, even with challenging poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is challenging due to ambiguities and self-occlusions. Existing methods using SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models suffer from inaccurate 3D priors and struggle with difficult poses and fine details.

Method: Jointly fine-tune multiview and 3D native generative models with pixel-aligned 2D-3D synchronization attention. Introduce a feature injection mechanism to lift fine details from 2D multiview images onto aligned 3D shapes.

Result: SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a promising direction for future 3D generation models by integrating complementary strengths of 2D and 3D generative models.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的高斯溅射方法在组合物体和场景时，由于烘焙的外观和阴影信息，导致不一致性。解决这个问题需要可重新照明的物体重建和场景照明估计。

Conclusion: ComGS 是一种新颖的 3D 物体-场景合成框架，它可以实现高质量、实时的渲染，并产生具有生动阴影的视觉和谐结果，只需要 36 秒的编辑时间。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为UltraLED的两阶段框架，仅使用单张短曝光RAW图像即可重建UHDR场景，从而避免了重影和运动模糊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RGB图像包围曝光方法容易出现错位和重影伪影，而短曝光图像已经保留了足够的高光细节。UHDR重建的主要挑战在于去噪和恢复黑暗区域的信息。RAW图像具有更高的位深度和更可预测的噪声特性，因此更适合应对这一挑战。

Method: 该方法首先通过比例图进行曝光校正以平衡动态范围，然后使用亮度感知RAW去噪器来增强黑暗区域的细节恢复。

Result: 大量实验表明，UltraLED明显优于现有的单帧方法。

Conclusion: UltraLED框架能够仅使用单张短曝光RAW图像有效地重建UHDR场景，并在动态场景中表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种新框架，该框架结合低帧率RGB视频和高帧率事件流来优化动态3D高斯溅射（3DGS）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从低帧率RGB视频重建动态3DGS具有挑战性，因为大的帧间运动会增加解空间的不确定性。事件相机可以异步捕获快速的视觉变化并且对运动模糊具有鲁棒性，但是它们不提供颜色信息。因此，结合低时间分辨率图像和高帧率事件流可以解决这个问题。

Method: 该方法利用事件运动先验来指导形变场的优化。首先，使用LoCM无监督微调框架提取事件流中编码的运动先验，以使事件流估计器适应特定的未见场景。然后，提出了一种几何感知数据关联方法来构建事件-高斯运动对应关系，这是管道的主要基础，并伴随两个有用的策略，即运动分解和帧间伪标签。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在合成和真实场景中均优于现有的基于图像和事件的方法，并证明该方法可以在事件数据的帮助下有效地优化动态3DGS。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效的结合RGB视频和事件流来优化动态3DGS的方法。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Method: 使用UNet模型进行脑肿瘤分割，并应用Grad-CAM和基于注意力的可视化XAI技术来增强对这些模型的理解。评估了三种深度学习模型：UNet、ResUNet和AttUNet。

Result: ResUNet在Dice和Jaccard相似性评分以及准确率、召回率和F1分数方面优于其他模型。Grad-CAM提供了对每个UNet模型关注的肿瘤亚区域的可视空间见解，而基于注意力的可视化提供了对AttUNet的注意力模块工作机制的有价值的见解。

Conclusion: ResUNet是性能最佳的模型，建议将其用于未来临床评估中的自动脑肿瘤分割。

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GTR-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating the geo-temporal reasoning capabilities of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) using both images/videos and graphics context. The benchmark reveals that current VLMs, including Gemini-2.5-Pro, significantly lag behind human performance in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks fail to adequately assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and emergency response.

Method: The authors introduce GTR-Bench, a novel benchmark that requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video context.

Result: Evaluations show that even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. The analysis reveals three main deficiencies: imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context, weakness in temporal forecasting, and lack of proficiency in comprehending or aligning map data with multi-view video inputs.

Conclusion: GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. The benchmark and code will be released.

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

Result: 在 MMEW、SMIC、CASME-II 和 SAMM 数据集上的实验表明，本文提出的 MM-COF 表示和 FMANet 优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 可学习的双相框架在推进微表情识别方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

Motivation: 传统的VP方法精度较低，并且存在表达能力受限和容易过拟合的问题。

Method: 提出了ACAVP，它引入了仿射变换来创建特定任务的提示区域，并使用颜色变换来强调任务相关的视觉特征。此外，还引入了TrivialAugment作为一种有效的数据增强方法。

Result: 在12个不同的图像分类数据集上的大量实验表明，ACAVP在VP方法中实现了最先进的精度，超过了线性探测的平均精度，并且对分布偏移表现出优异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ACAVP 是一种有效的视觉提示方法，它通过增强表达能力和使用数据增强来提高精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects

TL;DR: PrismGS: A physically-grounded regularization framework that improves the rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians for large urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting to large urban environments introduces aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering.

Method: Integrates pyramidal multi-scale supervision and explicit size regularization to improve the rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around 1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Conclusion: PrismGS improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians and achieves state-of-the-art performance in large urban environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Method: 结合了基于I3D的特征提取模块、专门的特征转换网络和音频生成管道，并利用一种新的非极大值抑制（NMS）算法进行非语法连续序列中手语的时间检测。

Result: 在ASL-Citizen-1500和WLASL-100数据集上取得了有竞争力的性能，Top-1准确率分别为72.01%和78.67%，音频质量指标（PESQ：2.67，STOI：0.73）表明语音输出清晰易懂。

Conclusion: 该方法在手语翻译成语音任务中表现出良好的性能，并提供了一种无需中间文本表示的直接通信方式。

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

*Yijie Gao,Houqiang Zhong,Tianchi Zhu,Zhengxue Cheng,Qiang Hu,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignGS提出了一种新框架，通过协同优化几何和语义，利用2D基础模型中的先验知识，通过语义到几何的指导机制（包括深度一致性和多方面的法线正则化）直接规范3D表示，从而实现鲁棒的稀疏视图重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常将语义视为被动特征，应用在已经形成但可能存在缺陷的几何体上，但对于鲁棒的稀疏视图重建，语义理解应该是一种主动的指导力量。

Method: AlignGS框架，协同优化几何和语义，从2D基础模型中提取先验知识，并使用它们通过一组新的语义到几何指导机制直接正则化3D表示，包括深度一致性和多方面的法线正则化。

Result: 在标准基准上进行了广泛的评估，证明该方法在novel view synthesis中取得了state-of-the-art的结果，并产生了具有卓越几何精度的重建。

Conclusion: 利用语义先验作为几何正则化器可以从有限的输入视图中获得更连贯和完整的3D模型。

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test
large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated

challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context
of the TOXBOX project.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为XYZCylinder的新的前馈模型，用于提升驾驶场景重建的泛化能力和重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前馈重建模型在重建驾驶场景时，由于固定的视角转换和稀疏视角之间的重叠区域小，导致泛化能力和重建精度受限。

Method: 该方法基于统一的圆柱体提升方法，包括相机建模和特征提升。提出了统一圆柱体相机建模（UCCM）策略，避免了学习视角相关的空间对应关系，并使用可调节参数统一不同的相机配置。此外，还提出了一种混合表示，基于新设计的圆柱平面特征组（CPFG），将2D图像特征提升到3D空间。

Result: 实验结果表明，XYZCylinder在不同的评估设置下取得了最先进的性能，并且可以以零样本的方式推广到其他驾驶场景。

Conclusion: XYZCylinder模型有效地提升了驾驶场景重建的泛化能力和重建精度。

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强强化学习的令牌压缩方法MARC，用于解决视觉语言模型处理视频时计算成本过高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无训练令牌压缩方法会导致信息丢失和性能下降。为了克服这个问题。

Method: MARC集成了结构化检索和基于强化学习的提炼，采用“检索然后压缩”的策略，使用视觉记忆检索器VMR选择关键片段，并使用压缩组相对策略优化C-GRPO框架将推理能力从教师模型提炼到学生模型。

Result: 在六个视频基准测试中，MARC仅使用一帧的令牌即可实现接近基线的准确率，从而将视觉令牌减少95％，GPU内存减少72％，延迟减少23.9％。

Conclusion: MARC具有在视频问答、监控和自动驾驶等资源受限环境中实现高效、实时视频理解的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 提出ASBench，一个全面的基准框架，专门用于评估异常合成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测在制造质量控制中起着关键作用，但其应用受到有限的异常样本和高昂的人工注释成本的限制。虽然异常合成提供了一个有希望的解决方案，但现有的研究主要将异常合成视为异常检测框架中的辅助组件，缺乏对异常合成算法的系统评估。目前的研究也忽略了异常合成特有的关键因素，例如将其影响与检测分离，定量分析合成数据以及在不同场景中的适应性。

Method: 该框架引入了四个关键评估维度：（i）不同数据集和管道的泛化性能（ii）合成数据与真实数据的比率（iii）合成图像的内在指标与异常检测性能指标之间的相关性，以及（iv）混合异常合成方法的策略。

Result: 通过广泛的实验，ASBench不仅揭示了当前异常合成方法的局限性，而且为异常合成的未来研究方向提供了可操作的见解。

Conclusion: ASBench是一个专门用于评估异常合成方法的综合基准框架，通过实验揭示了当前方法的局限性，并为未来的研究提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

Motivation: 视频基础模型(VFMs)在视觉生成方面表现出色，但在组合场景(例如，运动、数字和空间关系)中表现不佳。

Method: 该方法集成并优化了由通用布局-注意力目标引导的新参数。此外，在流媒体设置中制定了视频生成，并使用参数记忆机制维护历史优化上下文，该机制支持灵活的操作，例如插入、读取、更新和删除。

Result: TTOM能够解开组合世界知识，显示出强大的可转移性和泛化性。在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试上的实验结果表明，TTOM是一个有效的、实用的、可扩展的和高效的框架，可以实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: TTOM框架在组合视频生成方面表现出色，并且具有良好的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Conclusion: The model effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,

However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 Latent Harmony 的两阶段框架，用于超高清图像修复，该框架通过联合正则化潜在空间和强制执行高频感知重建来重新定义 VAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的变分自编码器 (VAE) 通过潜在空间处理提高效率，但其高斯约束通常会丢弃特定于退化的高频信息，从而损害重建保真度。

Method: 第一阶段引入 LH-VAE，通过视觉语义约束和渐进式退化扰动来增强语义鲁棒性，同时潜在等方差加强高频重建。第二阶段使用高频低秩自适应 (HF-LoRA) 联合训练这个精细的 VAE 与恢复模型：编码器 LoRA 由面向保真度的高频对齐损失引导以恢复真实的细节，解码器 LoRA 由面向感知的损失驱动以合成逼真的纹理。两个 LoRA 模块通过选择性梯度传播的交替优化进行训练，以保留预训练的潜在结构。

Result: 实验表明，Latent Harmony 在 UHD 和标准分辨率任务中实现了最先进的性能，有效地平衡了效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: Latent Harmony 是一种用于超高清图像修复的有效框架，它通过联合正则化潜在空间和强制执行高频感知重建来重新定义 VAE，从而在效率、感知质量和重建精度之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像隐私是上下文相关且主观的任务，需要研究哪种标签更合适。

Method: 对比对象标签和抽象标签在不同标签数量下的隐私分类效果。

Result: 当标签数量有限时，抽象标签更有效；当标签数量较多时，对象标签同样有效。

Conclusion: 研究结果可以指导未来开发更精确的图像隐私分类器，需要考虑标签类型和数量的作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光照图像中同时恢复高频细节和抑制严重噪声是一个计算机视觉领域的重要挑战。虽然 SwinIR 等大型 Transformer 模型在性能上表现出色，但其高计算成本限制了实际应用。

Method: 对比了 SwinIR 模型和轻量级 CNN 在低光照图像处理任务上的性能。

Result: SwinIR 的 PSNR 为 39.03 dB，轻量级 CNN 的 PSNR 为 37.4 dB。CNN 仅用 10 个 epochs 就收敛，而 SwinIR 需要 132 个 epochs。CNN 的模型大小比 SwinIR 小 55 倍以上。

Conclusion: 轻量级 CNN 能够以显著更低的计算成本提供接近最先进的结果，使其在资源受限的实际场景中具有吸引力。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Motivation: 在人机交互应用中，人体姿势估计至关重要。事件相机以其低延迟和低能耗的优势，在便携式电子产品和移动机器人等资源受限的应用中越来越受欢迎。

Method: 该方法利用事件相机的稀疏输出，采用基于线的事件中间表示，并结合新颖的偏移向量学习范例和基于置信度的池化来估计人体姿势。

Result: 首次将图神经网络应用于事件数据的人体姿势估计。

Conclusion: 提出了GraphEnet，一个利用事件相机数据进行人体姿势估计的图神经网络。

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

### [96] [Truth-Aware Decoding: A Program-Logic Approach to Factual Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07331)
*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为 Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD) 的面向验证的解码方案，该方案使神经语言生成与知识库对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将指令调整后的系统与在解码时运行的语义保护格对齐，从而增强了指令调整后的系统。

Method: TAD 具有四个贡献：(i) 一种基于约束的语义，可将 oracle 过滤呈现为程序逻辑判断，(ii) 一个证明，即贪婪选择在合理且完整的保护下享有局部似然优势（定理 2.7），(iii) 一种熵式不变量，可通过知识感知安全质量来量化事实风险，以及 (iv) 具有经过验证的 Lean 制品的多主体操作演算，以证明实施行为。

Result: 数值和算法案例研究证实，由此产生的护栏在不牺牲吞吐量的情况下减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: 在大型经验模型和形式验证之间架起了一座实用的桥梁。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的工业防御框架L2M-AID，利用LLM赋能的多智能体强化学习实现自适应和弹性安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的防御方法缺乏上下文感知，难以应对日益复杂的工业物联网(IIoT)攻击。

Method: 利用LLM作为语义桥梁，将海量非结构化遥测数据转换为丰富的上下文状态表示，使智能体能够推理对抗意图。使用MARL算法MAPPO学习复杂的合作策略。MARL奖励函数独特地设计为平衡安全目标(威胁中和)与操作要求。

Result: 在SWaT数据集和基于MITRE ATT&CK for ICS框架的新型合成数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明L2M-AID在关键指标上显著优于传统IDS、深度学习异常检测器和单智能体RL基线，实现了97.2%的检测率，同时将误报率降低了80%以上，并将响应时间提高了四倍。

Conclusion: L2M-AID在维护物理过程稳定性方面表现出优越的性能，为保护关键国家基础设施提供了一个强大的新范例。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

*Constantin Venhoff,Iván Arcuschin,Philip Torr,Arthur Conmy,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了思维语言模型 (thinking LM) 胜过其基础模型的原因，发现思维模型并非学习全新的推理能力，而是重用了基础模型中已存在的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思维模型优于基础模型的原因，是学习了全新的推理能力还是重用已存在的推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种混合模型，该模型可以在正确的时间激活基础模型中的推理机制，从而引发思维模型级别的推理链。此外，还引入了一种无监督的自下而上的方法，用于发现思维模型中可解释的推理行为。

Result: 该混合模型在不进行任何权重更新的情况下，恢复了高达 91% 的思维模型性能差距，同时仅控制了 12% 的 tokens。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型获得了大部分的推理机制，而后期训练则教会了模型在正确的时间有效地部署这些机制，从而能够有效地利用其推理时计算能力。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 倡导从静态心理健康诊断评估转向连续的、人工智能驱动的评估，以更好地服务于动态的思维。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维的需求。探讨生成式人工智能如何解决神经心理学中现有能力限制，从而实现更加个性化和长期的护理路径，以ADHD为例。

Method: 利用人工智能有效进行频繁的、低层次的患者体验抽样，并促进跨护理路径的诊断协调。

Result: 设想未来心理健康护理受益于连续、丰富和以患者为中心的数据抽样，以动态适应个体患者的需求和不断变化的情况，从而提高治疗的可及性和有效性。

Conclusion: 提出使用心理健康数字孪生（MHDT）作为个性化心理健康护理的变革框架，并基于经验证据规划了完善和实施该框架所需的研究议程。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

### [100] [ProSEA: Problem Solving via Exploration Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07423)
*William Nguyen,Vinh Luong,Christopher Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProSEA is a multi-agent framework for iterative problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agents lack true collaboration and adaptive reasoning.

Method: ProSEA uses a hierarchical architecture with a Manager Agent and domain-specialized Expert Agents, and dynamically replans based on feedback from failed attempts.

Result: ProSEA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the FinanceBench benchmark.

Conclusion: ProSEA shows potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive, and human-aligned AI agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

TL;DR: 提出了TESTAM+，一个增强的时空预测框架，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动的特征相似性相结合，引入了一种新的时空语义专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的专家混合框架，如时间增强时空注意力模型（TESTAM），缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的明确结合，限制了其空间能力。

Method: 提出了一种新的时空语义专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动的特征相似性相结合。

Result: 在METR LA上实现了1.3%的MAE降低（3.10 vs. 3.14），在PEMS BAY上实现了4.1%的改进（1.65 vs. 1.72）。最佳的Identity + Adaptive配置与最先进的MegaCRN相比，在METR LA上实现了11.5%的MAE降低（2.99 vs. 3.38），同时与完整的四专家TESTAM+相比，推理延迟降低了53.1%。

Conclusion: 更少、战略性设计的专家优于复杂的多专家集成，以卓越的计算效率为实时部署建立了新的最先进的性能。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 TS-Agent 的时间序列推理 agent，它利用 LLM 进行证据收集和综合，同时将统计和结构信息的提取委托给时间序列分析工具，从而避免了幻觉或知识泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，容易产生幻觉或知识泄漏。

Method: 该方法设计了一个时间序列推理 agent，它通过原子算子与原始数字序列交互，将输出记录在显式证据日志中，并在自我批评和最终质量门的指导下迭代地改进其推理。

Result: TS-Agent 在理解基准测试中取得了与最先进的 LLM 相当的性能，并在推理任务中取得了显著的改进。

Conclusion: TS-Agent 能够避免多模态对齐训练，保留时间序列的原始形式，确保可解释性和可验证性，并减轻知识泄漏或幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）理解流程模型的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在理解、纠错和推理流程模型方面的能力，以辅助业务流程设计

Method: 使用多种LLM，以交互和对话的方式，分析它们理解流程模型、发现语法和逻辑错误以及深入推理的能力

Result: 未经训练的LLM如ChatGPT在零样本设置下能有效理解BPMN流程模型，并在语法、逻辑和语义层面回答相关问题。不同LLM的性能有所差异。LLM在流程分析和优化中表现出拟人化属性

Conclusion: LLM可以作为业务流程设计者和用户的助手发挥有价值的作用

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究关注医疗智能系统(MIS)的风险降低优化问题，旨在通过根据可信AI伦理要求的覆盖范围，找到风险评估值的最佳平衡分配，从而在伦理考量下降低风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医疗智能系统(MIS)日益融入医疗工作流程，虽然带来了显著的效益，但也引发了严重的安全和伦理问题。欧盟AI法案将大多数MIS归类为高风险系统，因此需要正式的风险管理流程，以确保符合可信AI的伦理要求。

Method: 将该问题形式化为约束优化任务，并研究了三种解决方法：混合整数规划(MIP)、可满足性(SAT)和约束规划(CP)。使用Minizinc约束建模语言对该优化问题进行建模。

Result: 通过比较实验研究，分析了每种方法在求解方面的性能、表达性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 从该方法论的局限性出发，探讨了将Minizinc模型集成到完整的、可信的MIS伦理风险管理流程中的一些观点。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为 CompassLLM 的新型多智能体框架，该框架利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 的推理能力来解决常用路径查询问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法通常需要模型训练、参数调整和重新训练以适应数据更新。大型语言模型 (LLM) 在空间和基于图的推理方面表现出越来越强的能力，因此人们越来越有兴趣探索如何将这些模型应用于地理空间问题。

Method: CompassLLM 采用两阶段管道中的代理：搜索阶段，用于识别热门路径；以及生成阶段，用于在历史轨迹数据中不存在现有路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM 在搜索中表现出卓越的准确性，并在生成中表现出竞争性的性能，同时具有成本效益。

Conclusion: CompassLLM 是一种利用 LLM 解决地理空间问题的有效方法。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多智能体辩论（MAD）中由身份偏见引起的可靠性问题，并提出了通过匿名化响应来减少偏见的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体辩论系统存在身份驱动的奉承和自我偏见问题，导致智能体不批判地采纳同行的观点或固执地坚持自己的输出，从而降低了辩论的可靠性。

Method: 论文首先将辩论动态形式化为身份加权贝叶斯更新过程。然后，提出了响应匿名化方法，通过移除提示中的身份标记，迫使智能体平等看待自身和同行的观点，从而减少偏见。此外，还定义了身份偏见系数（IBC）来量化智能体采纳同行与自身观点的频率。

Result: 实验结果表明，身份偏见在多智能体辩论中普遍存在，且奉承行为比自我偏见更为常见。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，需要对身份进行“屏蔽”，以确保多智能体辩论系统基于内容而非来源身份进行推理。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

Conclusion: 这项工作为在以合规为中心的应用程序中高效的PII检测提供了一个可扩展和适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware

locales. RECAP's modular design supports over 300 entity types without
retraining, using a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and
filtering. Benchmarked with nervaluate, our system outperforms fine-tuned NER
models by 82% and zero-shot LLMs by 17% in weighted F1-score. This work offers
a scalable and adaptable solution for efficient PII detection in
compliance-focused applications.

Result: 旨在为评估重建完整性，并提供真正可信的AI进展衡量标准。

Conclusion: 当前自由放任的AI评估方法是不可持续的，需要转变为统一、实时和质量控制的基准框架。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“早期经验”的中间范式，利用agent自身行为产生的交互数据，其中结果的未来状态充当监督，无需奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前agent主要依赖于在专家数据上进行监督微调，这难以扩展且泛化能力差。专家演示仅捕获了狭窄的场景范围，并使agent暴露于有限的环境多样性。

Method: 研究了使用此类数据的两种策略：(1) 隐式世界建模，它使用收集的状态将策略置于环境动态中；(2) 自我反思，agent从其次优行为中学习以改进推理和决策。

Result: 在八个不同的环境和多个模型系列中评估，结果表明，该方法持续提高有效性和领域外泛化能力，突出了早期经验的价值。

Conclusion: 早期经验为后续强化学习提供了坚实的基础，是模仿学习和完全经验驱动的agent之间的实用桥梁。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级的澄清模块，旨在减少LLM多智能体系统中由于信息传递不准确导致的错误累积，从而提高系统准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于大型语言模型(LLM)的多智能体系统，由于边缘层面的错误累积，性能通常不如单智能体基线。

Method: 提出AgentAsk模块，通过在智能体间消息传递的关键点插入问题来阻止错误传播。该模块包含三个阶段：(1)从错误跟踪中提取边缘判断策略；(2)监督该策略以确定何时/什么/向谁/如何提问；(3)使用E-GRPO强化学习目标进行在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编程基准测试中，AgentAsk始终优于现有的多智能体系统，同时将延迟和额外成本保持在5%以下。

Conclusion: AgentAsk提供了一种可扩展的途径，以构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统，并通过边缘层面错误分类和局部干预方法，为多智能体系统的可靠性提升做出贡献。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 现有的基于大型语言模型（LLM）的序列多智能体系统难以信任，因为错误会在不同阶段之间悄无声息地传递。

Method: 作者构建了一个Planner -> Executor -> Critic的流水线，并评估了三种最先进的LLM的八种配置在三个基准测试上的表现。

Result: 结构化的、可问责的智能体间交接显著提高了准确性，并防止了简单流水线中常见的失败。不同的模型在角色方面有明确的优势和风险。准确性-成本-延迟的权衡取决于任务，异构流水线通常是最有效的。

Conclusion: 作者提供了一种实用的、数据驱动的方法来设计、追踪和调试可靠的、可预测的和可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

3. 在跨越不同设置的 16 个数据集变体中，TTM 始终提高模型性能，并推进组合推理的前沿。

Conclusion: 本文表明，通过改进评估指标和采用自提升算法，可以显著提高模型在组合推理方面的性能。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Result: Safe OPG几乎总是满足安全要求，即使现有方法严重违反它。Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User Exploration 能够在保证推荐系统安全实施的同时，探索新颖行为。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保证推荐系统安全实施的同时，探索新颖行为。

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

Result: 智能体在检测直接多模态矛盾方面表现尚可，但在全局安全性对齐方面存在不足，纠正不安全计划的成功率仅为55%。不安全行为与误导性视觉信息配对时，有45%的情况下被接受，表明智能体过度信任图像。

Conclusion: 当前的智能体架构在多模态安全性方面存在关键限制，该研究提供了一个可复现的平台，用于研究多模态安全性、连贯性和社会动态。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

Method: 提出了一种在线奖励生成方法，该方法通过在线因果监控STL，计算定量距离，并提供因果语义的平滑近似。

Result: 提出的STL引导的RL方法优于现有的STL引导的RL方法，为深度RL提供了更强大和高效的奖励生成框架。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于STL在线因果监控的在线奖励生成方法，可以解决强化学习中全局奖励稀疏导致的不稳定问题，实验结果表明该方法优于现有方法。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在理解化学反应机理方面的能力，特别是它们产生有效中间体、保持化学一致性以及遵循逻辑连贯的多步路径的能力。

Method: 引入oMeBench基准，包含超过10,000个带注释的机理步骤，并提出oMeS评估框架，结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性进行细粒度评分。

Result: 分析表明，目前的LLM模型在多步推理方面存在困难，但在提出的数据集上进行prompting策略和微调可以显著提高性能。

Conclusion: oMeBench将为推动AI系统实现真正的化学推理奠定基础。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Conclusion: SurveyG 能够生成更全面、结构更好的调查论文。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为“Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent”(MMIA) 的LLM驱动架构，该架构通过形式上可验证的推理过程来确保可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在医学领域显示出前景，但容易出现事实和逻辑错误，这在该高风险领域是不可接受的。为了解决这个问题。

Method: MMIA递归地将复杂的医学任务分解为原子的、基于证据的步骤。然后自动审核整个推理链的逻辑连贯性和证据可追溯性，类似于定理证明。MMIA的关键创新是“引导”模式，该模式将验证的推理链存储为“定理”。随后的任务可以使用检索增强生成 (RAG) 有效地解决，从而从昂贵的第一性原理推理转变为低成本的验证模型。

Result: 在四个医疗保健管理领域（包括 DRG/DIP 审计和医疗保险裁决）验证了 MMIA，使用了专家验证的基准。结果表明，MMIA 的错误检测率超过 98%，假阳性率低于 1%，明显优于基线 LLM。此外，随着知识库的成熟，RAG 匹配模式预计将降低约 85% 的平均处理成本。

Conclusion: MMIA 的可验证推理框架是朝着创建值得信赖、透明且具有成本效益的 AI 系统迈出的重要一步，使 LLM 技术适用于医学中的关键应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的 Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA) 框架，利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 将目标图恢复到类似源域的状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图领域自适应方法严重依赖源域数据，但由于隐私或安全问题，源域数据通常不可用。TT-GDA 旨在无需访问源示例即可迁移知识。

Method: 1. 将节点表示压缩成潜在特征，并使用图扩散过程建模图恢复过程。
2. 量化模块将恢复的特征编码成离散 tokens。
3. 微调 LLM 作为生成恢复器，将“noisy”目标图转换为“native”图。
4. 引入强化学习过程，通过专门的对齐和置信度奖励来提高恢复质量。

Result: 在各种数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的 GRAIL 方法能够有效地将目标图恢复到与源域对齐的状态，并在 TT-GDA 任务上取得了良好的效果。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

Motivation: 现有的分解方法是启发式的，依赖于代理或手动分解，导致大型语言模型（LLM）在复杂任务上存在可靠性问题。

Method: 将任务建模为约束问题，并利用形式复杂性度量来指导分解，提出ACONIC框架。

Result: 在组合（SATBench）和LLM数据库查询任务（Spider）上，通过遵循复杂性度量分解任务，代理的表现明显更好（10-40个百分点）。

Conclusion: 通过复杂性度量分解任务可以显著提高LLM在复杂任务上的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

*Hao Wu,Wei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的强化学习方法，Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)，通过引入外部标准参考答案来提升小模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法如GRPO受限于模型自身，无法从全对或全错的样本中学习。

Method: GCPO方法结合了外部标准参考答案，当模型无法解决问题时，参考答案提供正确响应，引导模型走向明确的更新方向。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得了显著成果，相较于基线模型有大幅提升。

Conclusion: GCPO通过充分利用每个样本提高训练效率，并使模型在训练过程中模仿参考答案的解题策略，从而增强推理的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

*Valerio La Gatta,Dolev Mutzari,Sarit Kraus,VS Subrahmanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在对抗环境中平衡信息获取和暴露风险的方法，通过通信来获取敌方位置，但通信也会暴露自身位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在对抗环境中智能体需要在信息获取和暴露风险之间进行权衡的关键策略问题。信息获取可以提高情境感知，但同时也会使智能体暴露于威胁之中。

Method: 提出了一个 PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) 游戏，其中追捕者需要决定何时通信以获取逃避者的位置。追捕者和逃避者通过强化学习学习他们的移动策略，而追捕者还学习一种通信策略，以平衡可观察性和风险。提出了 SHADOW 框架，它是一种多头序列强化学习框架，集成了连续导航控制、离散通信动作和用于行为预测的对手建模。

Result: SHADOW 追捕者比六个竞争基线实现了更高的成功率。时间序列建模和对手建模对于有效的决策至关重要。所学习的策略在不同的通信风险和智能体之间的物理不对称性中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SHADOW 框架在对抗环境中能够有效地平衡信息获取和暴露风险，并通过通信策略提高智能体的成功率。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

TL;DR: CityNav: A hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to city-wide networks and capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and coupled dynamics of urban traffic.

Method: Integrates a global traffic allocation agent with local navigation agents and introduces a cooperative reasoning optimization mechanism with a dual-reward structure.

Result: CityNav outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation on four real-world road networks.

Conclusion: LLMs can enable scalable, adaptive, and cooperative city-wide traffic navigation.

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FinMR: A new dataset for evaluating MLLMs in finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack the complexity and professional-level knowledge needed to evaluate MLLMs in finance.

Method: A new dataset, FinMR, was created with 3,200 question-answer pairs across 15 financial topics. It includes mathematical reasoning, financial knowledge, and visual interpretation tasks.

Result: Benchmarking of MLLMs on FinMR reveals performance gaps compared to professional financial analysts.

Conclusion: FinMR is a crucial benchmark for advancing multimodal financial reasoning to a professional level.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning
toward professional analyst-level competence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全由LLM驱动的时间序列预测框架Augur，它利用LLM因果推理来发现和使用协变量之间的有向因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的方法在模型架构中的作用被边缘化，依赖于粗略的统计文本提示，并且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 使用两阶段的师生架构，其中强大的教师LLM使用启发式搜索和成对因果关系测试从时间序列中推断出有向因果图。然后，一个轻量级的学生代理细化该图，并对编码为丰富文本提示的高置信度因果关系进行微调，以执行预测。

Result: 在具有25个基线的真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，Augur实现了具有竞争力的性能和强大的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: Augur 是一种有前景的时间序列预测框架，它利用 LLM 因果推理来发现和使用协变量之间的有向因果关系，从而提高预测准确性，同时产生关于变量交互的透明、可追溯的推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Result: 论文建立了一个包含100个查询的标准基准，并评估了四个领先的商业系统，揭示了不同的设计理念和性能权衡。

Conclusion: 该研究为DeepResearch系统从信息助手向智能研究伙伴的演进奠定了基础。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

Motivation: 人工智能系统很少能实现中立优化，反而会产生有偏见或不正确的结果，并降低公民和公务人员在决策中的能动性。

Method: 本文结合以人为本的AI透明度方法和社会技术系统观点，开发了有意义的公民AI系统透明度概念。

Result: 提出了有意义的透明度概念

Conclusion: 有意义的透明度允许公众参与影响他们生活的人工智能系统，将理解与行动潜力联系起来。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化LLM金融agent中的信息泄露问题，并解决其在实际交易中的泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出FactFin框架，通过反事实扰动促使LLM学习因果驱动因素，包含策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟四个核心组件。

Result: FactFin方法在样本外泛化能力上超过所有基线，实现了卓越的风险调整后收益。

Conclusion: 该研究表明FactFin框架能有效缓解LLM金融agent中的信息泄露问题，提高实际交易性能。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在结合上下文信息与用户特定数据方面存在不足，且个性化研究主要停留在概念层面，缺乏技术实现。

Method: 构建了一个框架，集成了持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和不断演变的用户档案，以实现个性化的长期互动。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上进行了评估，并通过为期五天的初步用户研究，获得了用户对感知个性化的反馈。

Conclusion: 研究结果初步表明，整合持久记忆和用户档案有助于提高LLM代理的适应性和用户感知的个性化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

Conclusion: TaoSR-SHE 框架有效地解决了现有方法的局限性，并在电商搜索相关性方面取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的移动GUI智能体主要关注自主操作，忽略了用户参与，导致在复杂场景下无法满足用户需求。

Method: ReInAgent集成了三个专业智能体，通过共享记忆模块进行动态信息管理，实现人机协同。

Result: ReInAgent能有效解决信息困境，结果更符合用户偏好。在复杂任务中，ReInAgent的成功率比Mobile-Agent-v2高25%。

Conclusion: ReInAgent通过持续的上下文信息分析和用户-智能体协作，克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的局限性，从而在复杂的现实场景中实现更具适应性和可靠性的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作已经发现语言模型嵌入可以用来重建原始值，但是，他们没有评估语言模型是否真的将连续值建模为连续的。

Method: 使用嵌入空间的预期属性，包括线性重构和主成分分析。

Result: 语言模型不仅将数字空间表示为非连续的，而且还引入了显着的噪声。虽然可以使用高保真度进行重建，但主成分仅解释了嵌入空间内的一小部分变异。

Conclusion: 这项工作的发现对使用嵌入模型的许多领域都有影响，特别是在高数值精度、大数量级或混合符号值常见的情况下。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR) 的奖励机制，旨在控制大型推理模型 (LRM) 生成的推理链的长度，同时保持准确性。PEAR 通过在思考阶段惩罚过高的熵，并在最终答案阶段允许适度的探索，从而鼓励模型生成简洁的推理过程。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但生成的推理链过长，包含冗余步骤，导致推理成本增加和可用性降低。因此，如何在不牺牲准确性的前提下控制生成推理的长度是一个开放的挑战。

Method: 本文通过系统的实证分析，发现模型熵和响应长度之间存在一致的正相关关系。基于此，本文提出了 PEAR，一种将阶段相关的熵纳入奖励设计的奖励机制。PEAR 不对所有 token 一视同仁，而是在思考阶段惩罚过高的熵，并在最终答案阶段允许适度的探索。

Result: 在四个基准测试中进行的大量实验表明，PEAR 能够持续减少响应长度，同时保持跨模型规模的竞争准确性。此外，PEAR 在训练分布之外表现出强大的分布外 (OOD) 鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEAR 能够自适应地控制响应长度，而无需依赖显式的长度目标或严格的截断规则。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaoyan Gu,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的参数高效微调方法 AILoRA，该方法通过结合函数感知的非对称低秩先验来提高微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 LoRA 方法存在性能欠佳和收敛缓慢等挑战。

Method: AILoRA 是一种参数高效的方法，它通过注入 W^Q 的主成分以保留任务自适应能力，并注入 W^V 的次要成分以保留可泛化的特征表示，从而执行函数感知的初始化。

Result: 实证分析表明，自注意力机制中的投影矩阵 W^Q 和 W^V 表现出不同的参数特征，这源于它们的功能差异。

Conclusion: 这种非对称初始化策略使 LoRA 模块能够更好地捕获注意力参数的专门角色，从而提高微调性能和收敛效率。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

*Qingyuan Shi,Qingwen Meng,Hao Cheng,Qing Xu,Jianqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LinguaSim is an LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive 3D scenarios for autonomous vehicle testing and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based scenario generation methods struggle to balance command adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments, often compromising realism by limiting scenarios to 2D or open-loop simulations.

Method: The proposed LinguaSim framework converts natural language into realistic, interactive 3D scenarios, ensuring dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity to user intent.

Result: Experiments show LinguaSim can generate scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions; comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

Conclusion: LinguaSim facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that enhance safety testing and training by bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop, interactive simulations, and constraining adversarial vehicle behaviors.

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

*Qingyang Hao,Wenbo Liao,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多条件共形选择（MCCS）算法，扩展了共形选择到多条件场景，实现了有限样本FDR控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模数据集中选择高质量候选者在资源受限的应用中至关重要，而现有的共形选择方法仅限于单阈值场景，忽略了多条件选择的实际需求。

Method: 针对合取条件，引入了具有区域单调性的新型非一致性评分；针对析取条件，采用了全局Benjamini-Hochberg（BH）程序。

Result: 大量实验验证了MCCS相对于基线的优越性，以及其在不同条件组合、不同真实世界模态和多任务可扩展性方面的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCCS能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

*Xiaochong Lan,Jie Feng,Yinxing Liu,Xinlei Shi,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AutoQual的基于LLM的代理框架，用于自动发现可解释的特征，以评估在线评论的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法跨领域扩展，深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，并且可能过度关注语义而忽略质量。

Method: 该框架模仿人类研究过程，迭代生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现将其操作化，并在持久记忆中积累经验。

Result: 大规模A/B测试表明，该方法有效，用户平均浏览评论数增加0.79%，评论读者转化率提高0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual是一个通用的框架，可以将嵌入在数据中的隐性知识转化为显式的、可计算的特征，并在大规模在线平台上得到验证。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个可证明的公平AI框架，该框架通过系统地移除所有敏感信息及其代理来克服当前偏差缓解方法的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏见缓解方法的局限性。

Method: 1. 使用 OWL 2 QL 中的本体工程，正式定义敏感属性并通过逻辑推理推断它们的代理，构建一个捕捉偏差模式完整结构的 sigma 代数 G。2. 通过 Delbaen Majumdar 最优传输获得公平表示，生成独立于 G 的变量，同时最小化 L2 距离以保持准确性。

Result: 在贷款审批等任务中，邮政编码等代理会泄露种族信息，从而确保完全公平。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将偏差建模为 sigma 代数之间的依赖关系，将本体知识编译成可测量的结构，并使用最优传输作为独特的公平转换，从而确保了可信 AI 的可证明和数学基础方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向多云计算的租户预算感知数据复制框架(TCDRM)，旨在满足租户预算要求的同时，确保可接受的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多云环境下的计算系统在满足租户预算要求的同时，难以保证性能。

Method: 该框架基于响应时间、租户预算和数据流行度动态创建数据副本，并采用启发式副本放置算法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在满足租户预算限制的同时，有效地实现了租户的性能目标。与非复制方法相比，带宽消耗降低了78%，复杂查询的平均响应时间减少了51%。

Conclusion: TCDRM策略能够充分利用多云环境提供的能力，在不超过租户预算的情况下，保持所需的性能。

Abstract: Multi-cloud computing systems face significant challenges in ensuring
acceptable performance while adhering to tenant budget requirements. This paper
proposes a tenant budget-aware (tenant-centric) data replication framework for
Multi-Cloud Computing (TCDRM). The proposed strategy dynamically creates data
replicas based on predefined thresholds for response time, economic budget of
the tenant and data popularity. TCDRM employs a heuristic replica placement
algorithm that leverages the diverse pricing structures of multiple cloud
providers. The TCDRM strategy aims to maintain the required performance without
exceeding the tenant's budget by taking advantage of the capabilities offered
by multicloud environments. The middleware considered acts as an intermediary
between tenants and multiple cloud providers, facilitating intelligent replica
placement decisions. To achieve this, the proposed TCDRM strategy defines
strict thresholds for tenant budget and response time. A performance evaluation
is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the strategy. The results show
that our approach effectively meets tenant performance objectives while
respecting their economic constraints. Bandwidth consumption is reduced by up
to 78% compared to non-replicated approaches, and average response time for
complex queries is decreased by 51%, all while adhering to tenant budget
limitations.

TL;DR: MobilityDuck 是一个 DuckDB 扩展，它集成了 MEOS 库以在 DuckDB 中提供时空和其他时间数据类型的支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时空数据的分析对于移动性分析越来越重要。尽管对移动对象数据库 (MOD) 进行了广泛的研究，但很少有系统可以在生产中使用或足够轻量以进行分析。MobilityDB 是一个值得注意的系统，它使用时空数据扩展了 PostgreSQL，但它也继承了架构的复杂性。

Method: MobilityDuck 利用 DuckDB 的轻量级、柱状、内存可执行属性来提供高效的分析。

Result: 我们的结果表明，MobilityDuck 保留了时空查询的表达能力，同时受益于 DuckDB 的内存、柱状架构。

Conclusion: MobilityDuck 是一个 DuckDB 扩展，它集成了 MEOS 库以在 DuckDB 中提供时空和其他时间数据类型的支持。据我们所知，没有现有的内存或嵌入式分析系统提供像 MobilityDuck 那样的原生时空类型和连续轨迹运算符。

Abstract: The analytics of spatiotemporal data is increasingly important for mobility
analytics. Despite extensive research on moving object databases (MODs), few
systems are ready on production or lightweight enough for analytics. MobilityDB
is a notable system that extends PostgreSQL with spatiotemporal data, but it
inherits complexity of the architecture as well. In this paper, we present
MobilityDuck, a DuckDB extension that integrates the MEOS library to provide
support spatiotemporal and other temporal data types in DuckDB. MobilityDuck
leverages DuckDB's lightweight, columnar, in-memory executable properties to
deliver efficient analytics. To the best of our knowledge, no existing
in-memory or embedded analytical system offers native spatiotemporal types and
continuous trajectory operators as MobilityDuck does. We evaluate MobilityDuck
using the BerlinMOD-Hanoi benchmark dataset and compare its performance to
MobilityDB. Our results show that MobilityDuck preserves the expressiveness of
spatiotemporal queries while benefiting from DuckDB's in-memory, columnar
architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的基数估计方法难以推广到新数据集，因为它们强烈依赖于原始数据或查询，从而限制了它们在实际场景中的实用性。

Method: 1. 使用模式语义预测数据分布，避免原始数据依赖。2. 引入查询模板无关的表示方法，以减轻查询依赖性。3. 构建一个从真实世界表派生的大规模查询数据集，并在其上预训练ZeroCard。

Result: ZeroCard具有明显的优势，并在查询优化中具有实际应用。它的零依赖属性极大地促进了在现实世界场景中的部署。

Conclusion: ZeroCard是一种有效的基数估计方法，它通过利用模式语义来克服现有方法的局限性，并且易于部署。

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database systems and plays a
critical role in query optimization. Despite significant advances in
learning-based cardinality estimation methods, most existing approaches remain
difficult to generalize to new datasets due to their strong dependence on raw
data or queries, thus limiting their practicality in real scenarios. To
overcome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit
cardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these
dependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven
cardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw
data access, query logs, or retraining on the target database. Specifically, we
propose to predict data distributions using schema semantics, thereby avoiding
raw data dependence. Then, we introduce a query template-agnostic
representation method to alleviate query dependence. Finally, we construct a
large-scale query dataset derived from real-world tables and pretrain ZeroCard
on it, enabling it to learn cardinality from schema semantics and predicate
representations. After pretraining, ZeroCard's parameters can be frozen and
applied in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate the distinct advantages of ZeroCard and show its practical
applications in query optimization. Its zero-dependence property significantly
facilitates deployment in real-world scenarios.

Method: 本文提出了一种受传统数据库系统中块嵌套循环连接运算符实现启发的算法，该算法将来自两个输入表的行批量集成到单个提示中。此外，还介绍了可用于优化行批量大小的公式，同时考虑了对 LLM 上下文窗口大小的约束。

Result: 形式分析和经验结果表明，所提出的方法显著降低了成本，并且与最新的语义查询处理引擎使用的连接实现相比，性能良好。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法有效地提高了语义连接的效率，并在实际应用中具有良好的性能。

Abstract: Semantic query processing engines often support semantic joins, enabling
users to match rows that satisfy conditions specified in natural language. Such
join conditions can be evaluated using large language models (LLMs) that solve
novel tasks without task-specific training.
  Currently, many semantic query processing engines implement semantic joins
via nested loops, invoking the LLM to evaluate the join condition on row pairs.
Instead, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, inspired by the block nested
loops join operator implementation in traditional database systems. The
proposed algorithm integrates batches of rows from both input tables into a
single prompt. The goal of the LLM invocation is to identify all matching row
pairs in the current input. The paper introduces formulas that can be used to
optimize the size of the row batches, taking into account constraints on the
size of the LLM context window (limiting both input and output size). An
adaptive variant of the proposed algorithm refers to cases in which the size of
the output is difficult to estimate. A formal analysis of asymptotic processing
costs, as well as empirical results, demonstrates that the proposed approach
reduces costs significantly and performs well compared to join implementations
used by recent semantic query processing engines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Reasoning by Exploration (RoE) 的新方法，通过将图推理视为图探索过程来统一检索和生成，以解决大型语言模型 (LLM) 在处理结构化图时的挑战。该方法通过监督微调和强化学习进行训练，实验表明，RoE 在基准数据集上实现了显着的改进，并且可以有效地推广到未见过的图。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在处理结构化图时面临根本性挑战，尤其是在扩展到大型图时。现有的检索增强生成 (RAG) 方法难以忠实地结合图结构，并且通常泛化能力差。

Method: 提出 Reasoning by Exploration (RoE) 方法，该方法将图推理视为图探索过程，通过 LLM 选择要探索的候选节点和边，逐步构建推理路径并生成答案。RoE 分为两个阶段进行训练：在黄金推理路径上进行监督微调 (SFT)，然后进行强化学习 (RL) 以提高探索效率和泛化能力。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，RoE 优于基线方法，并且可以有效地推广到未见过的图。

Conclusion: RoE 方法通过统一检索和生成，并结合监督微调和强化学习，能够有效地解决大型语言模型在处理结构化图时的推理挑战，并在泛化能力方面表现出色。

Abstract: Reasoning over structured graphs remains a fundamental challenge for Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly when scaling to large graphs. Existing
approaches typically follow the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm:
first retrieving subgraphs relevant to the query and then generating answers
conditioned on the retrieved subgraphs. However, such two-phase pipelines often
struggle to faithfully incorporate graph structure, since the generation
process is ultimately constrained by the quality and completeness of the
retrieved subgraph. Although many advanced retrievers have been proposed
recently to mitigate this issue, they are usually tailored to the training
graphs and generalize poorly to unseen graphs, which limits their practical
applicability. In this work, we propose Reasoning by Exploration (RoE), a novel
approach that unifies retrieval and generation by framing reasoning over graphs
as a process of graph exploration. At each step, the LLM selects candidate
nodes and edges to explore, gradually constructing reasoning paths and
generating answers along the way. To enable effective exploration, RoE is
trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on gold reasoning paths,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration effectiveness
and generalization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RoE
achieves substantial overall improvements over baselines, while also
generalizing effectively to unseen graphs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于内容级别的用户调查反馈指标，称为“留存相关性”，用于评估用户返回平台获取类似内容的意愿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的推荐系统依赖于点击和喜欢等短期参与信号来个性化内容，但这些信号通常嘈杂、稀疏，不足以捕捉长期用户满意度和留存。

Method: 通过心理测量方法验证留存相关性，并建立其收敛、区分和行为有效性。开发了一个可用于生产的代理模型，将留存相关性整合到社交媒体平台的多阶段排序系统的最后阶段。

Result: 大规模离线建模表明，在预测次日留存方面，留存相关性显著优于参与信号和其他调查指标，尤其对于历史参与度有限的用户。基于该模型的校准分数调整在提高参与度和留存率的同时，减少了低质量内容的曝光。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个经过经验验证的框架，将内容级别的用户感知与生产系统中的留存结果联系起来。提供了一个可扩展的、以用户为中心的解决方案，可促进平台增长和用户体验。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement
signals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these
signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user
satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel
content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users'
intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey
measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets
forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions
and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive
Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent,
discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we
show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals
and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for
users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy
model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage
ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based
on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention,
while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale
A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework
linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production
systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both
platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for
responsible AI development.

Motivation: 现有的信息检索模型不足以捕捉现代信息环境的全貌。

Method: 通过三个关键概念（组件、干预变量和活动）来概念化信息检索过程，并使用案例研究分析了六个现有的信息检索模型。

Result: 展示了现有模型的局限性以及ISMIE的必要性。概述了两个研究蓝图：一个以用户为中心，行业驱动的实验设计，用于解决人工智能生成内容的真实性和信任危机；一个以系统为中心，学术驱动的设计，用于解决多巴胺驱动的内容消费。

Conclusion: ISMIE框架为开发信息检索模型奠定了基础，以促进对现代信息环境中人机交互和系统设计的理解。

Abstract: The modern information environment (MIE) is increasingly complex, shaped by a
wide range of techniques designed to satisfy users' information needs.
Information seeking (IS) models are effective mechanisms for characterizing
user-system interactions. However, conceptualizing a model that fully captures
the MIE landscape poses a challenge. We argue: Does such a model exist? To
address this, we propose the Information Seeking in Modern Information
Environments (ISMIE) framework as a fundamental step. ISMIE conceptualizes the
information seeking process (ISP) via three key concepts: Components (e.g.,
Information Seeker), Intervening Variables (e.g., Interactive Variables), and
Activities (e.g., Acquiring). Using ISMIE's concepts and employing a case study
based on a common scenario - misinformation dissemination - we analyze six
existing IS and information retrieval (IR) models to illustrate their
limitations and the necessity of ISMIE. We then show how ISMIE serves as an
actionable framework for both characterization and experimental design. We
characterize three pressing issues and then outline two research blueprints: a
user-centric, industry-driven experimental design for the authenticity and
trust crisis to AI-generated content and a system-oriented, academic-driven
design for tackling dopamine-driven content consumption. Our framework offers a
foundation for developing IS and IR models to advance knowledge on
understanding human interactions and system design in MIEs.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video content across various platforms has
highlighted the urgent need for advanced video retrieval systems. Traditional
methods, which primarily depend on directly matching textual queries with video
metadata, often fail to bridge the semantic gap between text descriptions and
the multifaceted nature of video content. This paper introduces a novel
framework, the Video-Text Cluster (VTC), which enhances video retrieval by
clustering text queries to capture a broader semantic scope. We propose a
unique clustering mechanism that groups related queries, enabling our system to
consider multiple interpretations and nuances of each query. This clustering is
further refined by our innovative Sweeper module, which identifies and
mitigates noise within these clusters. Additionally, we introduce the
Video-Text Cluster-Attention (VTC-Att) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts
focus within the clusters based on the video content, ensuring that the
retrieval process emphasizes the most relevant textual features. Further
experiments have demonstrated that our proposed model surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models on five public datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于检索增强生成（RAG）抄袭检测的新数据集RPD和一个双层水印系统，以保护RAG系统中的知识产权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG虽然可以缓解LLM的幻觉和信息过时问题，但也可能导致大规模的未经授权的数据盗用。本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 1. 构建了一个新的数据集RPD，专门用于RAG抄袭检测。2. 开发了一个双层水印系统，该系统在语义和词汇层面嵌入保护，并辅以使用统计假设检验的询问者-侦探框架。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了该方法在不同的查询量、防御提示和检索参数下的有效性，同时保持了对对抗性规避技术的弹性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为检索增强人工智能系统中的知识产权保护建立了一个基础框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
mitigating hallucinations and outdated information issues, yet simultaneously
facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this
challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel
dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses
diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in
existing resources. Second, we develop a dual-layered watermarking system that
embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an
interrogator-detective framework that employs statistical hypothesis testing on
accumulated evidence. Extensive experimentation demonstrates our approach's
effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval
parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion
techniques. This work establishes a foundational framework for intellectual
property protection in retrieval-augmented AI systems.

TL;DR: PLUM: Adapts LLMs for large-scale recommendation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage LLMs' sequence modeling and world knowledge for recommendation systems.

Method: Item tokenization with Semantic IDs, continued pre-training on domain-specific data, and task-specific fine-tuning for generative retrieval.

Result: PLUM significantly improves retrieval compared to production models.

Conclusion: PLUM can be launched to billions of users in YouTube, with insights on scaling, continued pre-training, and Semantic ID enhancements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new paradigm of modeling and computation
for information tasks. Recommendation systems are a critical application domain
poised to benefit significantly from the sequence modeling capabilities and
world knowledge inherent in these large models. In this paper, we introduce
PLUM, a framework designed to adapt pre-trained LLMs for industry-scale
recommendation tasks. PLUM consists of item tokenization using Semantic IDs,
continued pre-training (CPT) on domain-specific data, and task-specific
fine-tuning for recommendation objectives. For fine-tuning, we focus
particularly on generative retrieval, where the model is directly trained to
generate Semantic IDs of recommended items based on user context. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on large-scale internal video recommendation
datasets. Our results demonstrate that PLUM achieves substantial improvements
for retrieval compared to a heavily-optimized production model built with large
embedding tables. We also present a scaling study for the model's retrieval
performance, our learnings about CPT, a few enhancements to Semantic IDs, along
with an overview of the training and inference methods that enable launching
this framework to billions of users in YouTube.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型生成物品使用场景的互补推荐系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于历史数据的方法难以推断主观且因人而异的互补关系，因此本文着重于物品组合的潜在使用场景。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成物品使用场景，以此构建互补推荐系统。

Result: 通过人工标注评估了LLM生成场景的合理性，结果表明约85%的生成场景被认为是合理的。

Conclusion: LLMs可以有效地生成真实的物品使用场景。

Abstract: Complementary recommendations suggest combinations of useful items that play
important roles in e-commerce. However, complementary relationships are often
subjective and vary among individuals, making them difficult to infer from
historical data. Unlike conventional history-based methods that rely on
statistical co-occurrence, we focus on the underlying usage context that
motivates item combinations. We hypothesized that people select complementary
items by imagining specific usage scenarios and identifying the needs in such
situations. Based on this idea, we explored the use of large language models
(LLMs) to generate item usage scenarios as a starting point for constructing
complementary recommendation systems. First, we evaluated the plausibility of
LLM-generated scenarios through manual annotation. The results demonstrated
that approximately 85% of the generated scenarios were determined to be
plausible, suggesting that LLMs can effectively generate realistic item usage
scenarios.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces TaoSR-AGRL, a new reinforcement learning framework for query-product relevance prediction in e-commerce search, specifically Taobao. It addresses the limitations of existing methods in handling complex business rules and user queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex business rules and user queries, lacking robust reasoning capacity for long-tail cases. Reinforcement learning approaches suffer from sparse rewards, hindering multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence.

Method: The paper proposes TaoSR-AGRL, which includes Rule-aware Reward Shaping (decomposing relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards) and Adaptive Guided Replay (injecting ground-truth guidance to correct low-accuracy rollouts).

Result: TaoSR-AGRL outperforms DPO and GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. It has been successfully deployed in Taobao Search.

Conclusion: TaoSR-AGRL effectively improves query-product relevance prediction by addressing the challenges of complex rules and sparse rewards, leading to better performance and real-world deployment on Taobao.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and
has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic
understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and
business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative,
reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes
the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning
capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via
reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient
guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these
challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning
framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance.
TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which
decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned
with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which
identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted
ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating
reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on
large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human
evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO
baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence,
and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully
deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of
users.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种名为 VersionRAG 的版本感知 RAG 框架，旨在解决传统 RAG 系统在处理版本化文档时表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 RAG 系统在处理版本化的技术文档时，无法准确回答版本相关的问题，准确率仅为 58-64%。

Method: VersionRAG 通过分层图结构显式地对文档演化进行建模，该结构捕获版本序列、内容边界以及文档状态之间的变化。在检索过程中，VersionRAG 基于意图分类，通过专用路径路由查询，从而实现精确的版本感知过滤和变更跟踪。

Result: 在 VersionQA 基准测试中，VersionRAG 达到了 90% 的准确率，优于 naive RAG (58%) 和 GraphRAG (64%)。在隐式变更检测方面，VersionRAG 达到了 60% 的准确率，而基线方法则失败 (0-10%)。此外，VersionRAG 在索引期间所需的 token 比 GraphRAG 少 97%。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了版本化文档 QA 作为一个独特的任务，并为未来的研究提供了一个解决方案和基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive
questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity
checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly
models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to
track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer
tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale
deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and
provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

Conclusion: 开源ReasonEmbed资源以推动领域研究进展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ReasonEmbed, a novel text embedding model
developed for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our work includes three
key technical contributions. First, we propose ReMixer, a new data synthesis
method that overcomes the triviality problem prevalent in previous synthetic
datasets, enabling large-scale production of 82K high-quality training samples.
Second, we design Redapter, a self-adaptive learning algorithm that dynamically
adjusts training each sample's weight based on its reasoning intensity. This
allows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships
between queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple
backbones of varying sizes, all of which achieve superior performance on
reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model
offers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which
significantly outperforms existing text embedding models. We will fully
open-source our created resources in ReasonEmbed to push forward the research
advancement in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解用户生命周期价值 (LTV) 对于优化广告分配效率和最大化广告赞助商的投资回报率 (ROI) 至关重要，从而有助于平台商业化收入的增长。然而，用户 LTV 分布的固有复杂性给准确的 LTV 预测带来了重大挑战。现有技术主要侧重于通过精心设计的损失函数直接学习 LTV 分布，但由于容易受到异常值的影响，因此收效甚微。

Method: 该模型旨在首先预测特定价格的交易数量，然后从这些中间预测中计算总付款金额。

Result: 在真实世界的工业数据集上评估了所提出的模型，并与最先进的 ZILN 模型一起部署在 TapTap RTB 广告系统上进行在线 A/B 测试。

Conclusion: 提出的模型在实际数据集和在线 A/B 测试中都表现良好，可以有效提高 LTV 预测的准确性。

Abstract: For Internet platforms operating real-time bidding (RTB) advertising service,
a comprehensive understanding of user lifetime value (LTV) plays a pivotal role
in optimizing advertisement allocation efficiency and maximizing the return on
investment (ROI) for advertisement sponsors, thereby facilitating growth of
commercialization revenue for the platform. However, the inherent complexity of
user LTV distributions induces significant challenges in accurate LTV
prediction. Existing state-of-the-art works, which primarily focus on directly
learning the LTV distributions through well-designed loss functions, achieve
limited success due to their vulnerability to outliers. In this paper, we
proposed a novel LTV prediction method to address distribution challenges
through an objective decomposition and reconstruction framework. Briefly
speaking, based on the in-app purchase characteristics of mobile gamers, our
model was designed to first predict the number of transactions at specific
prices and then calculate the total payment amount from these intermediate
predictions. Our proposed model was evaluated through experiments on real-world
industrial dataset, and deployed on the TapTap RTB advertising system for
online A/B testing along with the state-of-the-art ZILN model.

Motivation: 早期干预和定制教育策略对改善自闭症儿童的预后至关重要，但在技能发展之前，对于理解和解决自闭症儿童细微的行为模式和情感识别方面存在关键差距。

Method: 采用纵向方法监测自闭症儿童的情绪和行为，旨在建立对自闭症学生（尤其是在信息技术领域）所面临的独特需求和挑战的基线理解。

Conclusion: 强调了循证干预方法的重要性，该方法优先深入了解每个孩子的行为和情感，以此作为有效技能发展的基础。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时间序列分析方法难以处理复杂的时间依赖和跨通道交互，而人类分析师可以通过可视化来发现隐藏模式。因此，作者希望通过引入视觉表示来增强自动化时序分析。

Method: 该方法将每个时间序列通道渲染为彩色编码的线图，并采用时间感知视觉块对齐策略，将视觉块与相应的时间段对齐。MLLM4TS融合了数值数据的细粒度时间细节和视觉表示的全局上下文信息。

Result: 在标准benchmark上的大量实验表明，MLLM4TS在预测和生成任务中都表现出色。

Conclusion: 该研究结果表明，将视觉模态与预训练语言模型相结合，可以实现鲁棒和通用的时间序列分析。

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于多模态图神经网络架构搜索的模态感知协同协同进化算法(MACC-MGNAS)，用于预测软件漏洞的协同利用攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络架构搜索(GNAS)方法局限于单一模态，忽略了模态异构性，导致攻击预测准确率不高。

Method: 1) 提出一个模态感知的协同协同进化(MACC)框架，采用分而治之的范式；2) 引入一种模态感知的双轨代理(MADTS)方法，以降低评估成本并加速局部基因进化；3) 设计了一种基于相似性的种群多样性指标(SPDI)策略，以自适应地平衡探索和利用。

Result: 在标准漏洞协同利用(VulCE)数据集上，MACC-MGNAS在仅3个GPU-hours内实现了81.67%的F1分数，比最先进的竞争对手高出8.7%的F1，同时降低了27%的计算成本。

Conclusion: MACC-MGNAS方法在预测软件漏洞协同利用攻击方面具有优势，能够有效提高预测准确率并降低计算成本。

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态学习模型忽略了两个关键挑战：各种数据模态可能学习不均匀，从而导致模型偏向某些模态；模型可能强调对某些人口群体的学习，导致不公平的表现。这两个方面会相互影响，导致不平衡和不公平的多模态学习。

Method: 提出了一种名为MultiFair的方法，采用双层梯度调制过程，在数据模态和群体层面动态调整训练梯度的优化方向和幅度。

Result: 在两个具有不同人口群体的多模态医学数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明MultiFair优于最先进的多模态学习和公平学习方法。

Conclusion: MultiFair在多模态医学分类任务中表现出色，能够有效解决不平衡和不公平的学习问题。

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了两种最先进的深度学习模型（GNN-RNN 和 MMST-ViT）在美国农作物产量预测中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化日益干扰农业系统，准确的作物产量预测对粮食安全至关重要。虽然深度学习模型在使用卫星和天气数据进行产量预测方面显示出希望，但它们跨地理区域和年份进行泛化的能力（这对于实际部署至关重要）在很大程度上仍未经过测试。

Method: 该研究使用来自 2017-2022 年的 CropNet 大型数据集，在现实的分布外 (OOD) 条件下，对两种最先进的模型 GNN-RNN 和 MMST-ViT 进行了基准测试。通过跨七个 USDA 农业资源区域的留一集群交叉验证和提前一年预测方案，确定了跨区域可转移性的显着差异。

Result: GNN-RNN 在地理变化下表现出卓越的泛化能力和正相关性，而 MMST-ViT 在域内表现良好，但在 OOD 条件下性能急剧下降。像 Heartland 和 Northern Great Plains 这样的区域表现出稳定的转移动态（大豆的 RMSE 小于 10 bu/acre），而 Prairie Gateway 在两种模型和作物中都表现出持续的欠佳表现（RMSE 大于 20 bu/acre），揭示了可能由半干旱气候、灌溉模式和不完整的光谱覆盖驱动的结构差异。除了准确性差异之外，GNN-RNN 的训练速度比 MMST-ViT 快 135 倍（14 分钟对 31.5 小时），使其更适合可持续部署。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调，时空对齐（而不仅仅是模型复杂性或数据规模）是鲁棒泛化的关键，并强调需要透明的 OOD 评估协议，以确保公平和可靠的气候感知农业预测。

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

Result: KernelCoder模型在KernelBench上显著优于现有最佳模型QwQ-32B，并超越了所有开源模型和前沿模型，如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标。所提出的流程可以帮助在未来获得更好的内核生成数据。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的推理能力的提高通常涉及扩展参数数量和训练数据的大小，或者通过让模型生成复杂的思维链来扩展推理计算。但关键计算集中在有限的层范围内。

Method: Encode-Think-Decode (ETD)

Result: 在 17 个推理基准测试中，ETD 模型产生了显着收益，在 GSM8K 上获得了 +28.4% 的相对准确率提升，在使用 OLMo-2 1B Base 模型时，在 MATH 上获得了 +36%。

Conclusion: 递归潜在推理为更强大的 LLM 推理提供了一条简单有效的途径。

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

*Nathan Boyer,Dorian Baudry,Patrick Rebeschini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究具有付费观察的线性上下文bandits问题，提出了一种计算高效的Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) 算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在给定的上下文中，学习者选择一个动作以最小化其损失，并且可以决定支付固定成本来观察任何臂的损失。

Method: 基于带有矩阵几何重采样的有效估计器的Follow-the-Regularized-Leader框架。

Result: 在对抗性设置中，实现了$\\Theta(T^{2/3})$的minimax最优遗憾，同时保证了在（损坏的）随机状态下的poly-对数遗憾。

Conclusion: 为“hard problem”设计BOBW算法，使用了为我们考虑的设置量身定制的分析技术。

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

### [166] [Learning to Route LLMs from Bandit Feedback: One Policy, Many Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07429)
*Wang Wei,Tiankai Yang,Hongjie Chen,Yue Zhao,Franck Dernoncourt,Ryan A. Rossi,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为BaRP的新方法，用于在大规模部署中更有效地利用大型语言模型（LLM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数路由器都是离线训练的，这与实际部署中只能观察到所选模型的输出结果的限制不符。此外，不同的模型有不同的优势，价格会波动，用户对准确性和成本的重视程度也不同。

Method: BaRP 是一种基于 Bandit 反馈的路由方法，它在与部署相同的Partial-feedback限制下进行训练，同时支持可调整偏好的推理。该方法将问题建模为一个关于prompt特征和用户偏好向量的contextual bandit，在训练期间模拟在线反馈设置，并根据每个新的prompt调整其路由决策。

Result: 实验结果表明，BaRP 的性能始终优于强大的离线路由器至少 12.46%，并且优于最大的 LLM 至少 2.45%，并且可以针对未见过的任务进行稳健的泛化。

Conclusion: BaRP 是一种有效且稳健的 LLM 路由方法，可以在实际部署中显著提高性能和效率。

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

*Ankur Naskar,Gugan Thoppe,Utsav Negi,Vijay Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 联邦学习可以通过在多个代理之间分配探索和训练来显着加速强化学习。它可以保证最佳收敛速度，该速度与代理数量成线性比例，即速率为 $\tilde{O}(1/(NT))$，其中 $T$ 是迭代索引，$N$ 是代理数量。然而，当训练样本来自马尔可夫链时，现有的 TD 学习实现此速率的结果要求算法依赖于未知的问problem 参数。我们通过提出一种具有 Polyak-Ruppert 平均的两时间尺度联邦时间差分 (FTD) 学习来弥合这一差距。我们的方法在平均奖励和折扣设置中都可证明地达到最佳 $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ 速率——为马尔可夫数据提供了一种无参数 FTD 方法。虽然我们的结果即使在单代理设置中也是新颖的，但它们适用于具有异构环境的 FL 这一更现实和更具挑战性的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TD学习算法依赖于未知的problem参数，无法达到最优的收敛速度。

Method: 提出了一种具有Polyak-Ruppert平均的两时间尺度联邦时间差分(FTD)学习算法。

Result: 该方法在平均奖励和折扣设置中都可证明地达到最佳$\tilde{O}(1/NT)$速率。

Conclusion: 该方法为马尔可夫数据提供了一种无参数FTD方法，并且适用于具有异构环境的联邦学习场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

### [168] [MoGU: Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07459)
*Yoli Shavit,Jacob Goldberger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MoE框架，称为MoGU，用于回归任务和时间序列预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE只提供点估计，而MoGU将每个专家的输出建模为高斯分布，从而可以直接量化预测及其内在的不确定性（方差）。

Method: MoGU的核心创新是其基于不确定性的门控机制，该机制使用每个专家估计的方差来确定其对最终预测的贡献，从而取代了传统的基于输入的门控网络。

Result: 在各种时间序列预测基准上进行评估，MoGU始终优于单专家模型和传统MoE设置。它还提供了良好量化、信息丰富的不确定性，这些不确定性与预测误差直接相关，从而提高了预测的可靠性。

Conclusion: MoGU在时间序列预测方面表现出色，并且能够提供与预测误差相关的可靠的不确定性估计。

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的基于Transformer的神经网络模型metabeta，用于贝叶斯混合效应回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯混合效应回归在分析多组分层数据时非常常见，但贝叶斯推断在分析上是难以处理的，并且需要使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗（MCMC）方法进行昂贵的近似。

Method: 该方法使用Transformer神经网络模型metabeta进行贝叶斯混合效应回归。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上，metabeta达到了与基于MCMC的参数估计相当的性能，但所需时间仅为通常所需时间的一小部分。

Conclusion: Metabeta可以在贝叶斯混合效应回归中实现快速且准确的参数估计。

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出使用张量补全作为替代模型，以加速材料设计，特别是在训练数据来自设计空间中的非均匀随机抽样时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在设计新材料时，随着设计变量的增加，搜索空间呈指数增长，这使得合成和验证每种材料的属性非常不切实际且耗时。现有的机器学习方法在训练数据来自非均匀随机抽样时表现不佳。

Method: 使用张量补全作为替代模型。

Result: 实验表明，在搜索空间的有偏抽样中，张量补全优于经典 ML 方法（如高斯过程和 XGBoost），R^2 提高了约 5%。

Conclusion: 张量补全在整个搜索空间的均匀随机抽样中仍然具有可比的性能。

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

*Majid Jaberi-Douraki,Hossein Sholehrasa,Xuan Xu,Remya Ampadi Ramachandran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 HySim-LLM 的统一数学和计算框架，旨在提高大型语言模型 (LLM) 在从科学文献中提取和标准化药代动力学 (PK) 信息方面的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从科学文献中提取和标准化药代动力学 (PK) 信息仍然是计算药理学中的重大挑战，这限制了药物开发中数据驱动模型的可靠性。大型语言模型 (LLM) 在文本理解和推理方面取得了显著进展，但它们对结构化生物医学数据（如 PK 表）的适应仍然受到异质性、噪声和领域转移的限制。

Method: 本文提出了一种统一的数学和计算框架 HySim-LLM，该框架集成了嵌入加权微调和流形感知去噪，以增强 LLM 的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Result: 本文建立了两个理论结果：(1) 一个相似性加权泛化边界，用于量化嵌入散度下的适应性能；(2) 一个基于流形的去噪保证，用于限制来自噪声或离流形样本的损失贡献。

Conclusion: 该框架为在生物医学和数据密集型科学领域中实现可靠且可解释的 LLM 适应提供了一条数学基础途径。

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是美国癌症死亡的主要原因，且非吸烟者和家族聚集研究表明存在遗传因素。全基因组关联研究 (GWAS) 发现的遗传生物标志物是评估肺癌风险的有前途的工具。

Method: 应用基于 Transformer 的深度学习到单核苷酸多态性 (SNP) 的 GWAS 数据，用于预测肺癌风险。直接处理原始基因型数据，无需临床协变量，引入了附加的位置编码、神经基因型嵌入和改进的变异过滤。

Result: 在 27,254 名百万退伍军人计划参与者的数据上进行训练，HEMERA 实现了 >99% 的 AUC (受试者工作特征曲线下面积) 分数。

Conclusion: 支持用于个性化肺癌风险评估和早期干预的透明、假设生成模型。

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

Motivation: 可穿戴设备面临电池续航和计算资源不足的挑战，而新型计算密集型和延迟敏感型应用不断涌现。

Method: 将任务卸载过程建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），并利用 Q-learning 技术使可穿戴设备能够在没有先验知识的情况下做出最佳任务卸载决策。

Result: 通过在 ns-3 网络模拟器中进行的大量仿真，评估了所提出框架在各种应用和系统配置下的性能。结果表明，Q-learning 算法的主要系统参数变化会影响平均任务完成时间、平均能耗和任务卸载百分比。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效地解决可穿戴设备在计算能力和电池续航方面的挑战，并通过调整 Q-learning 算法的参数来优化性能。

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际约束下研究机器生成文本的黑盒检测，其中评分模型可能与未知的源模型不匹配，并且每次输入的对比生成成本很高。

Method: SurpMark 是一种基于参考的检测器，它通过其 token surprisals 的动态来总结段落。SurpMark 将 surprisals 量化为可解释的状态，估计测试文本的状态转移矩阵，并通过测试转换和两个固定参考（人工与机器）之间的广义 Jensen-Shannon (GJS) 差距对其进行评分。

Result: 在多个数据集、源模型和场景中，SurpMark 始终与基线相匹配或超过基线；实验证实了统计量的渐近正态性，并且消融实验验证了所提出的离散化的有效性。

Conclusion: SurpMark 是一种有效的黑盒检测方法，可以在实际约束下检测机器生成的文本。

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究通常只检查孤立的攻击面或特定场景，缺乏对MAS漏洞的整体理解。

Method: 通过大量实验，评估planner-executor MAS的效用和脆弱性。

Result: 发现planner比executor更重要，planner的记忆模块是必不可少的，任务性能和鲁棒性之间存在权衡，针对planner的攻击特别有效。

Conclusion: 这些发现为提高MAS的鲁棒性提供了可操作的见解，并为多智能体环境中的防御奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

Conclusion: 多模态协同训练是一种有效的方法，可以开发数据高效且稳健的AI系统，从而在动态、真实世界的环境中有效地推广。

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

Motivation: 传统睡眠分期依赖于人工标注或时域/频域脑电信号特征，耗时且可能不够准确。

Method: 利用连续小波变换（CWT）生成时频图，捕捉睡眠分期相关的瞬态和振荡模式，并结合集成学习。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，小波分析在稳健、可解释和临床适用的睡眠分期分类方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,
and clinically applicable sleep stage classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp) 的新方法，用于从图平稳节点观测中估计公平图，减少图中连接对敏感属性的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图中的边通常表现出连接某些组对的偏好，这会导致下游图任务的不公平待遇。因此，论文考虑了对应于组和节点级别定义的图的组和个体公平性。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于优化的方法FairSpecTemp，它有两种变体：一种直接约束偏差，另一种通过限制图谱中的偏差来隐式地鼓励公平估计。

Result: 该方法具有高概率性能界限，在公平性和准确性之间实现了有条件的权衡。实验结果表明，为了恢复公平图，不必牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: FairSpecTemp在合成和真实世界数据集上的评估表明了其有效性，并突出了两种变体的优势。

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of

### [179] [Targeted Digital Twin via Flow Map Learning and Its Application to Fluid Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07549)
*Qifan Chen,Zhongshu Xu,Jinjin Zhang,Dongbin Xiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种数值框架，用于构建目标数字孪生 (tDT)，该框架直接对完整数字孪生 (DT) 中感兴趣量 (QoI) 的动态进行建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建完整数字孪生计算成本高昂，为了降低成本，提出了只关注感兴趣量的tDT。

Method: 采用基于内存的流图学习 (FML) 来开发 QoI 的数据驱动模型，使用通过重复执行完整 DT 生成的短时轨迹数据。

Result: 数值结果表明，tDT 可以准确地长期预测作用力，同时完全绕过完整的流动模拟。

Conclusion: tDT 是紧凑的动力系统，可以演化这些力，而无需明确了解底层流场。

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

*Lénaïc Chizat,Pierre Marion,Yerkin Yesbay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了dropout在两层神经网络中大规模宽度下的渐近行为，发现dropout的作用取决于学习率、dropout率和宽度之间的关系，并揭示了dropout在不同阶段的等效行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解dropout在大型神经网络中的作用，特别是在大规模训练语言或视觉模型中的性能提升。

Method: 研究了dropout在均值场初始化尺度下，梯度下降在两层神经网络中的大宽度渐近行为，并获得了丰富的渐近相图。

Result: 发现了五个不同的非退化阶段，这些阶段取决于dropout率、学习率和宽度之间的相对大小。发现dropout的“惩罚”效应只在学习率极小的情况下持续存在。对于较大的学习率，dropout等价于一种“随机几何”技术。

Conclusion: 为重新理解dropout在大型神经网络中的理论奠定了基础。

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

Result: 提取了29个主题，包括人工智能、编程和伦理等，并分析了主题与模型偏好之间的关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果可为特定领域的大型语言模型微调和优化提供信息，以提升实际性能和用户满意度。

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance
maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our
findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

Conclusion: EBGAN-MDN是多模态学习任务的一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal behavior cloning faces significant challenges due to mode

where modeling multiple valid actions ensures both performance and safety. We
propose EBGAN-MDN, a framework that integrates energy-based models, Mixture
Density Networks (MDNs), and adversarial training. By leveraging a modified

Conclusion: LOTUS是朝着为多个无监督ML任务进行模型选择迈出的有希望的第一步。

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for
Unsupervised Scenarios), a simple yet effective method to perform model
selection for multiple unsupervised machine learning(ML) tasks such as outlier
detection and clustering. Our intuition behind this work is that a machine
learning pipeline will perform well in a new dataset if it previously worked
well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for
multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于离散状态空间扩散模型（D3PM）的符号回归方法，称为 Symbolic Diffusion，它可以同时生成方程的所有 tokens。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于神经网络的符号回归模型大多使用基于 Transformer 的自回归模型，但自回归生成只能从左到右生成 tokens，且未来的 tokens 仅依赖于之前生成的 tokens。为了克服这一局限性，本文旨在同时生成所有 tokens 以获得更好的闭式方程。

Method: 本文提出了 Symbolic Diffusion，一种基于 D3PM 的离散状态空间扩散模型，它可以同时生成方程的所有 tokens。

Result: 在为 SymbolicGPT 开发的二元数据集上，本文将基于扩散的生成方法与基于 SymbolicGPT 的自回归模型进行了比较，结果表明，在使用类似底层架构的模型中，本文提出的扩散生成方法可以提供与自回归生成方法相当甚至在某些指标上更优的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于扩散的生成方法为基于神经网络的符号回归开辟了新的研究机会。

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

Motivation: 分析LNN和RNN在模型精度、内存效率和泛化能力上的差异。

Method: 系统地回顾现有研究，探讨这些神经网络架构在处理序列数据中的基本原理、数学模型、关键特性和固有挑战。

Result: LNN在处理噪声、非平稳数据和实现分布外（OOD）泛化方面表现出显著潜力，并且在参数效率和计算速度方面优于传统RNN。RNN由于其成熟的生态系统和在各种任务中的成功应用，仍然是序列建模的基石。

Conclusion: 本文总结了LNN和RNN的异同，各自的缺点和挑战，并为未来的研究指出了有价值的方向，特别强调了提高LNN的可扩展性以促进其在更广泛和更复杂的场景中的应用的重要性。

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 大型语言模型通常通过输出词汇token来进行推理，但这种方式限制了它们与外部环境的交互。本文提出将环境交互从语言中解耦，通过扩展动作空间（ExpA）将交互内置化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型在与外部环境交互时，需要通过文本进行解析和路由，导致模型负担过重的问题。

Method: 通过扩展动作空间（ExpA）将环境交互内置化，并提出ExpA强化学习（EARL）与反事实策略优化。

Result: EARL在需要多轮交互和应急规划的任务中优于强基线模型，在基于计算器的多任务学习中表现稳健，并在部分观察排序问题中实现了完美的Sort-4准确率，同时自我发现了一种与经典设计相比具有竞争力的有效算法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效探索扩展的动作空间和新环境，并在多轮交互和应急规划任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TG库通常是为特定架构定制的，阻碍了对这个快速发展领域中各种模型的支持。此外，连续时间动态图方法（CTDG）和离散时间动态图方法（DTDG）之间的差异限制了直接比较和思想转移。

Method: 我们引入了时间图建模（TGM），这是一个面向研究的TG机器学习库，也是第一个统一CTDG和DTDG方法的库。TGM提供对动态节点特征、时间粒度转换以及链接、节点和图级别任务的本机处理的一流支持。

Result: TGM在多个模型、数据集和任务上的平均速度比广泛使用的DyGLib快7.8倍，并且在图离散化方面的平均速度比可用实现快175倍。

Conclusion: TGM通过启用动态图属性预测和时间驱动的训练范例，开辟了全新的研究可能性，为以前不切实际的研究问题打开了大门。

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自注意力机制的Transformer模型，用于间接结构健康监测（iSHM）中检测断轨，该模型通过重建训练，并从学习到的注意力权重偏差中导出异常分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在铁路轨道评估中，使用车载传感器进行间接结构健康监测(iSHM)具有成本效益，但由于复杂的车辆动力学、信号噪声以及有标签数据的稀缺性，可靠地检测小的、瞬态的异常仍然是一个巨大的挑战。

Method: 本文设计了一个增量合成数据基准，以系统地评估模型在面对速度变化、多通道输入和iSHM中遇到的真实噪声模式等逐渐复杂的挑战时的鲁棒性。使用该基准，评估了几种已建立的无监督模型以及作者提出的Attention-Focused Transformer。该模型采用自注意力机制，通过重建进行训练，但创新地主要从学习到的注意力权重偏差中导出异常分数。

Result: 基准测试结果表明，虽然基于Transformer的模型通常优于其他模型，但所有测试模型都表现出对高频局部噪声的显著脆弱性，这被认为是实际部署的关键瓶颈。值得注意的是，作者提出的模型实现了与最先进的解决方案相当的精度，同时表现出更好的推理速度。

Conclusion: 未来的iSHM模型迫切需要增强噪声鲁棒性，并且作者提出的更高效的基于注意力的方案为开发实用的车载异常检测系统奠定了有希望的基础。

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

TL;DR: DGTEN: A unified graph framework for dynamic trust evaluation that combines uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating dynamic trust in evolving graphs requires models that capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and resist adversarial manipulation.

Method: DGTEN uses Gaussian distributions for nodes/edges, hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass positional encoding with Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based attention, and robust adaptive ensemble coefficient analysis.

Result: DGTEN improves MCC by 10.77% in single-timeslot prediction and 16.41% in cold-start scenarios on Bitcoin trust networks; it also surpasses baselines by up to 11.63% MCC under adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The DGTEN framework is effective for dynamic trust evaluation.

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

TL;DR: 本文对大型语言模型（LLM）的机器遗忘技术进行了研究，旨在移除不 жела的 数据、知识和行为，同时保留有用的模型能力。研究表明，目前的评估方法过于片面，无法全面反映模型的生成行为，并提出了开放式问答（Open-QA）指标来弥补这一缺陷。此外，还发现鲁棒性需要更细粒度的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的机器遗忘技术旨在移除不 жела的 数据、知识和行为（例如，出于安全、隐私或版权考虑），同时保留有用的模型能力。然而，LLM 遗忘技术的研究仍然分散，对于如何有效进行遗忘以及如何严格评估缺乏清晰的认识。

Method: 本文提出了一个包含十二种最新有状态遗忘方法的分类法，这些方法分为三个方法论家族： divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and rejection-based targeted unlearning。在此分类法的基础上，重新审视了遗忘有效性 (UE)、效用保持 (UT) 和鲁棒性 (Rob) 的评估，重点关注 WMDP 基准。

Result: 分析表明，当前以多项选择题 (MCQ) 准确性为主的评估方法过于片面，通常会夸大成功，同时忽略模型的实际生成行为。开放式问答 (Open-QA) 指标可以更好地捕捉生成性能，并揭示方法家族中固有的 UE-UT 权衡。鲁棒性需要更细粒度的分析：例如，域内重新学习和域外微调之间的漏洞差异很大，即使两者都属于模型级别的攻击。

Conclusion: 通过这项研究，希望能够全面回顾 LLM 遗忘技术，并为设计和评估未来的方法提供可操作的指导。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Result: 首次建立了理论Pareto前沿，并设计了算法EXP3-N-CS。

Conclusion: 该研究平衡了MABNI中遗憾最小化和推断准确性之间的权衡。

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究使用基于流的模型来估计完整的回报分布，并识别具有高回报方差的状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法将未来回报的分布简化为单个标量值，而分布强化学习方法利用回报分布来提供更强的学习信号，并应用于探索和安全强化学习。然而，以往方法在估计回报分布的精细结构以及区分具有高回报不确定性的状态方面存在问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的流匹配目标，该目标生成满足分布贝尔曼方程的概率密度路径。利用学习到的流模型，使用新的流导数ODE来估计不同状态的回报不确定性。此外，使用这种不确定性信息来优先学习对某些转移的更准确的回报估计。

Result: 在37个基于状态和25个基于图像的基准任务上的实验表明，Value Flows在成功率方面平均提高了1.3倍。

Conclusion: Value Flows方法在离线和在线到在线的设置中均优于先前的方法。

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

TL;DR: FedQS improves semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL) by adaptively optimizing local training based on client heterogeneity, achieving better accuracy, loss, and convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) struggles to optimize both gradient-based and model-based aggregation strategies, which have trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability.

Method: FedQS classifies clients into four types and adaptively optimizes their local training based on data distribution and resources.

Result: FedQS achieves higher accuracy, lower loss, and fast convergence compared to state-of-the-art baselines on various tasks.

Conclusion: FedQS bridges the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, providing a unified solution for stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

TL;DR: 提出LiveThinking，一个双阶段优化框架，以解决AI电商直播中数字虚拟人物对实时响应的需求问题，该需求对高延迟的大型推理模型(LRM)并不适用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI电商直播中的数字虚拟人物需要实时响应以提高用户参与度，而高延迟的大型推理模型(LRM)不适合此任务。

Method: 首先，通过拒绝采样微调(RFT)将一个670B的教师LRM提炼成一个轻量级的30B混合专家(MoE)模型(3B激活)，从而降低计算成本。然后，采用带有群体相对策略优化(GRPO)的强化学习来压缩模型的推理路径，并由一个平衡正确性、帮助性和简洁性的多目标奖励函数指导。

Result: LiveThinking实现了30倍的计算成本降低，实现了亚秒级延迟。在淘宝直播的实际应用中，响应正确率提高了3.3%，帮助性提高了21.8%。

Conclusion: 通过数十万观众的测试，该系统显著提高了商品交易总额(GMV)，证明了其在增强实时交互环境中的用户体验和商业表现方面的有效性。

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

TL;DR: 提出了改进的图随机特征（GRFs++），用于高效和准确地计算图节点上的核函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GRFs难以建模远距离节点关系，依赖长图随机游走采样。

Method: 提出walk-stitching技术，连接多个短游走，并扩展GRFs的游走停止机制，使用更广泛的策略控制游走长度。

Result: GRFs++继承了长游走的近似质量，提高了效率，以短游走的并行计算和矩阵乘法代替低效的长游走采样。扩展的停止机制提高了图核的近似精度，且没有增加计算成本。

Conclusion: GRFs++在效率和精度上优于传统GRFs，并通过实验和理论分析验证了这一结论。

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

Motivation: 当前的离线强化学习方法在复杂、长期的序列决策中仍然面临挑战。

Method: 该方法利用动作序列进行价值学习，并通过分离的价值学习来解决过度价值高估问题。

Result: DEAS 在 OGBench 的复杂、长期任务中始终优于基线，并且可以应用于增强预测动作序列的大规模视觉-语言-动作模型的性能。

Conclusion: DEAS 显著提高了 RoboCasa 厨房模拟任务和真实世界操作任务的性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为GeoGen的两阶段框架，用于生成大规模的LBSN签到轨迹数据，以解决数据获取成本高和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LBSN轨迹数据在POI推荐、广告和疫情干预等领域的应用价值，但获取成本高且存在隐私问题，因此需要生成具有真实数据特征且保护隐私的合成数据。

Method: 该方法首先重建连续时空的潜在运动序列，然后设计一个稀疏感知的时空扩散模型（S$^2$TDiff）来学习潜在的行为模式。接着，设计一个基于Transformer的Seq2Seq架构Coarse2FineNet，通过建模语义相关性和行为不确定性，从粗粒度的潜在运动序列生成细粒度的LBSN轨迹。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，GeoGen在保真度和效用评估方面优于最先进的模型，例如，在FS-TKY数据集上，距离和半径指标分别提高了69%和55%以上。

Conclusion: GeoGen框架能够有效地生成高质量的合成LBSN签到轨迹数据，并在保真度和效用方面表现出色。

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

TL;DR: 递归 Transformer 通过多次重用参数和迭代隐藏状态来解耦计算深度和参数深度。但计算量不足时，参数较少的递归模型通常落后于非递归模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示了递归模型的两个主要瓶颈：无差异计算和信息过载。无差异计算迫使核心在每次迭代中采用相似的计算模式，而信息过载则要求长时信息和瞬时信息共存于单个隐藏状态。

Method: 提出了 Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) 方案，该方案将状态管理外化到显式内存缓冲区中，并采用轻量级路由器来动态地多样化迭代中的计算。

Result: 在 Pythia 套件 (160M-1.4B) 上，MeSH 增强的递归 Transformer 始终优于递归基线，并且在 1.4B 规模上优于其较大的非递归对应模型，在非嵌入参数减少 33% 的情况下，平均下游精度提高了 +1.06%。

Conclusion: MeSH 是一种可扩展且有原则的架构，用于构建更强大的递归模型。

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

Motivation: t-SNE被广泛使用，但人们普遍认为它能产生与其输入结构大致匹配的可视化结果。

Method: 通过证明和实践演示

Result: 输入聚类的强度和异常点的极端性不能从t-SNE输出中可靠地推断出来。

Conclusion: t-SNE的可视化结果可能无法真实反映输入数据的结构。

Abstract: Central to the widespread use of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
(t-SNE) is the conviction that it produces visualizations whose structure
roughly matches that of the input. To the contrary, we prove that (1) the
strength of the input clustering, and (2) the extremity of outlier points,
cannot be reliably inferred from the t-SNE output. We demonstrate the
prevalence of these failure modes in practice as well.

TL;DR: 提出了FedBook，一个用于联邦图基础模型的统一联邦图基础代码本，可以在服务器端联邦预训练期间系统地聚合客户端的本地代码本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图基础模型通常假设可以集中访问多域图，但由于隐私和机构限制，这通常是不可行的。联邦图基础模型 (FedGFM) 解决了这个限制，但它们的有效性从根本上取决于构建一个强大的全局代码本，该代码本通过整合每个域内相互加强的语义来实现域内连贯性，同时通过保留跨域的异构知识来保持域间多样性。

Method: FedBook遵循一个两阶段过程：(1) 域内协作，其中低频 tokens 通过参考客户端中语义上更可靠的高频 tokens 来细化，以增强特定领域的连贯性；(2) 域间集成，其中客户端的贡献通过其代码本在全局 GFM 聚合期间的语义独特性来加权，从而保留跨域多样性。

Result: 在跨多个领域和任务的 8 个基准测试中进行的大量实验表明，FedBook 始终优于 21 个基线，包括孤立的监督学习、FL/FGL、集中式 GFM 的联邦改编和 FedGFM 技术。

Conclusion: FedBook 在联邦图学习中表现出色，通过域内协作和域间集成，有效地提升了模型性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

Motivation: 现有的锐度度量与泛化能力之间的相关性不强。

Method: 定义Rényi锐度为损失Hessian矩阵的负Rényi熵，利用Rényi锐度的重参数化不变性，并将数据差异转化为权重扰动，从而建立泛化能力和Rényi锐度之间的关系。

Conclusion: Rényi锐度是一个有效的泛化能力度量，RSAM是一种有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.
