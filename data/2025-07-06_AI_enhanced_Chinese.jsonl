This method is a hybrid\nof non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality\nreduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,\neliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to\nvoting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority\nvoting.

However, in\nstandard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in\nnatural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To\ncapture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have\nexplored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent\nspace, potentially supporting latent CoT.

We\nexamine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of\nprobing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens.

One common\napproach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests\ncontent based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to\nthe target user.

Music is one such medium, since the average user of a\nmusic streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due\nto this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with\nother methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing\nthese challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in\nmitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore\nvarious methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical\nanalysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing\ntechniques.

While GDC users can interactively\ncreate complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially\nnew ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of\npossible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe\ntheir desired cohort in free-text natural language.\n  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for\ncurating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the\nGDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of\ntheir desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further\nanalysis.

In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for\nCER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static\nand dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,\nand text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,\nour approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image\nPretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene\nunderstanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)\nmodule that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a\nCompound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability\nAggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods\nto produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus\ntraining, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%\non Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via\nzero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches\ntrained on target data.

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data\nfrom audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and\nevaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases\nwhere the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across\nclasses appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has\nroughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce\ninterventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that\nfurther reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u81ea\u52a8\u62db\u8058\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u770b\u4f3c\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4f53\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u7b97\u6cd5\u6b67\u89c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6b63\u88ab\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u4ece\u62db\u8058\u5230\u8d37\u6b3e\u53d1\u653e\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002\u5224\u65ad\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u5176\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u5bf9\u5e94\u65b9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u590d\u6742\u800c\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u91cd\u65b0\u91c7\u6837\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u62b5\u6d88\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u62db\u8058\u7387\u56e0\u67d0\u4e9b\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u53ef\u4ee5\u5747\u8861\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u867d\u7136\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u770b\u4f3c\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u8fc7\u4fbf\u5229\u6837\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u5dee\u5f15\u5165\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6211\u4eec\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u52a8\u62db\u8058\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u8de8\u7c7b\u522b\u5747\u8861\u57fa\u672c\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u516c\u5e73\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f3c\u4e4e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5747\u7b49\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f53\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u7ea6\u6709 10% \u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4f53\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u7b97\u6cd5\u6b67\u89c6\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u8de8\u7c7b\u522b\u5747\u8861\u57fa\u672c\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u516c\u5e73\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f3c\u4e4e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5747\u7b49\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f53\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u7ea6\u6709 10% \u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4f53\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u7b97\u6cd5\u6b67\u89c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6211\u4eec\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u52a8\u62db\u8058\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u8de8\u7c7b\u522b\u5747\u8861\u57fa\u672c\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u516c\u5e73\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f3c\u4e4e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5747\u7b49\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f53\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u7ea6\u6709 10% \u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4f53\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u7b97\u6cd5\u6b67\u89c6\u3002"}}

As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two\ntasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given\npaper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,\nwhich retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We\nprovide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose\nConfidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation\nmetric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses\nlimitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where\nmultiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also\nserve as GAs.

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step.

Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data\nefficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely\non 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still\nrequire weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer\nfrom a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a\nstep change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet\nprecise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although\nmany adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of\ndifferent conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.\nWe study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object\ndetection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and\nlayout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning\nyields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning\nbecomes superior.

An essential component for modeling graph\nstructures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the\nalgorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the\nblock level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to\nfacilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIRES \u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5-\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u52a0\u901f GCN \u7684\u6838\u5916 SpGEMM \u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8be5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe 1.8 \u500d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc (GCN) \u5728\u5404\u79cd\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ece\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528 (PPI) \u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5728 GCN \u4e2d\u5bf9\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u7528\u77e9\u9635-\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5 (SpGEMM)\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d GPU \u5185\u5b58\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u65ad\u6269\u5927\uff0cSpGEMM \u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u6838\u5916\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7 GPU \u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u6df7\u5408 CPU-GPU \u5185\u5b58\u5e03\u5c40\u6216\u4ee5\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6838\u5916 SpGEMM \u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8 I/O \u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c GPU \u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "AIRES\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5-\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f GCN \u7684\u6838\u5916 SpGEMM \u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\uff0cAIRES \u63d0\u51fa\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u77e9\u9635\u5728\u5757\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u94fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u5757\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\uff0cAIRES \u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5177\u6709\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u96c6\u6210 GPU \u5185\u5b58\u3001GPU Direct Storage (GDS) \u548c\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11 I/O \u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cAIRES \u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe 1.8 \u500d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "AIRES\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e 1.8 \u500d\u3002"}}

However, efficiently fine-tuning them for\ndownstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this\nwork, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables\nflexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks\nwithout modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a\nstructured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling\noperators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model\nlayers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an\nequivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight\nadapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while\nmitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting.

To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully\nautomated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in\nnatural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -\nand rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate\nNL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the\nautomated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,\ninstruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models\nachieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal\nplans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis\nshows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is\ncontingent on both model and prompt design.

While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the\nsame instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation\nframeworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This\noverlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences\nin annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a\npopular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in\ntraining ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying\nassumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this\npaper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,\nhighlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and\nnoise (e.g., annotation error).

This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address\nthis, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which\nextends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of\nabstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through\nstylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual\nrepresentations remain consistent across both the original and augmented\ndistributions.

To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs\nare primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)\nlike humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all\nreasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:\nCan we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon\nin LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage\nfine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and\nredundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes\nof model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined\nwith a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model\nenhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated\nreasoning strategies across various tasks.

An\nideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal\nbackground intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the\ncorresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a\nsemantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse\nappearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based\nmethods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly\ngenerators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when\nthe mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations.

To address these challenges, we\npropose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework\nthat integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and\nevaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function\nuncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free\nidentification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward\ncomponents.

The\nsimulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC\nnetwork exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing\nSC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1(KGZS-SC)\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93(KG-SKB)\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002KG-SKB\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u4f20\u8f93\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7aef\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60(ZSL)\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5206\u7c7b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728APY\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684KGZS-SC\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5404\u79cdSNR\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684SC\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "KGZS-SC\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684SC\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented\ninformation to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational\nstrategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered\nKnowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable\nof decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This\nposition paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from\nrelated concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse\nfields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational\nmethodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE) to translate human expert knowledge into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol (KP) to solve the struggle of prevailing methods in tasks that demand deep, procedural, and methodological reasoning", "motivation": "Prevailing methods like RAG and general-purpose Agentic AI often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains.", "method": "introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol (KP).", "result": "defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse fields such as law and bioinformatics", "conclusion": "Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE) allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks."}}

These shortcuts arise from a\nfundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations\nof the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer\nmatching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it\ngenerate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the\nreference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach.

In\nclinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is\ncritical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the\nunique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,\nDeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the\nconsecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both\nmagnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights\nin real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach\naccurately captures feature coalition effects.

However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal\nforgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for\nlocalization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been\nstudied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,\nleveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16\n\\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL\nlocalization due to enormous amounts ($\\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256\n\\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with\nEnhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and\nadaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double\nAttention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag\nPrototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,\nand (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting\nin both bag and instance classification.

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental\nevaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB\nNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based\nweakly supervised segmentation.

GORP expands the optimization\nspace while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.\nExtensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's\nsuperior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

The encoding component of auto-encoders\nenables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering\nexplicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an\nencoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,\nwhich learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the\nlatent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the\nlatent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing\nregion-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the\nrepresentations to regress positional information of the patches from\nhigh-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for\ndifferentiating tissue types of the brain.

Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods\ncan be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the\nfundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a\nconsistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity\nthroughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine\ndetails. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named\nAvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup\npatterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a\ncoarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,\nand then to refine the details.

Due to the uncertainties in diffusion\nprocess, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and\nexpressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely\napply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and\nmultiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding\nthe averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images.

However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual\nmodality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world\nenvironments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from\ntarget MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.\nHowever, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger\nfor unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding\nin realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric\njailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in\nconstructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context.

VisCo fabricates\ncontextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically\ngenerating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric\njailbreak scenario.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)\nmethod that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant\nprompts through parallel graph networks.

To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a\nZero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,\nwithout requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong\ngeneralization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring\nillumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising\nmodule. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection\ncomponents via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances\nnon-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive\ncorrection method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined\niteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public\ndatasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under\ncomplex lighting conditions.

Inspired by general object detection,\nnon-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be\npotential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional\nfully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes\na new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires\nsimple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our\nscheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential\ntarget mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and\nmulti-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to\nfurther improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity\nbetween positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose\na long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the\nlocal motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The\nextensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that\nour weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised\nmethods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nfully-supervised ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c \u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7531\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5c0f\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u5f31\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u7684\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u7684\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u5e27\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SAM\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6316\u6398\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u6fc0\u6d3b\u56fe\u548c\u591a\u5e27\u80fd\u91cf\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6b63\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08DAUB \u548c ITSDT-15K\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u751a\u81f3\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\uff08SOTA\uff09\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684 90% \u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff08WeCoL\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u91cf\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

The\nreliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR\ndata. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including\nmisrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they\nare primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality\nassessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess\ndata fitness for research.\n  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit\ntesting and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data\nquality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking\nTool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test\ngenerator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a\ntest suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework\nthat executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.\n  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and\nSyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions.

Crucially, this enables\nthe framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby\nfreeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely\non human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and\nseeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner\niteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,\nregularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and\nconstraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy\ncorresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at\nlower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By\ninterpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \\emph{functors} that generate\nand condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional\nstructure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively\ngeneralised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing\nmeta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and\ncompared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design\nprinciples for structuring meta-learning.

We prove that these bonuses\nnaturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the\nagent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and\nrewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis\nprovides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked\ntheoretical grounding.

Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\\eg, SAM) cannot\naccurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this\nwork, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to\naddress these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch\noptimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with\nplausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and\nphysical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the\nhuman proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two\noptimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization\nframework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints\nbased on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to\nassist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our\nmethod is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos\ncaptured in complex environments.

We attribute\nthis issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.\nTo address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework\nthat decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,\nCanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity\nmodification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped\nfeature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the\npreservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve\nprecise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we\ndesign a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source\nidentity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial\nregions.
