### [1] [Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904)
*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified co-training framework with magic tokens enables efficient and controllable content safety in LLMs, achieving strong safety performance with reduced complexity and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained, post-deployment controllability.

Method: a unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety behaviors within a single SFT stage, dynamically activated via magic tokens

Result: The method matches the safety alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with the 8B model surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing training complexity and deployment costs.

Conclusion: This work presents a scalable, efficient, and highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The purpose of this report is to share preliminary results with task participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission papers.

Method: MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.

Result: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation Shared Task.

Conclusion: The official WMT25 ranking will be based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the automatic ranking.

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission

### [3] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个LLM驱动的框架，用于数学应用题的文化本地化，解决了低资源语言中多语言数学推理的不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏反映准确的本地实体（如人名、组织名称和货币）的社会文化任务数据集，低资源语言中多语言和文化相关的数学推理落后于英语。

Method: LLM驱动的数学应用题文化本地化框架，可自动构建包含原生姓名、组织和货币的数据集。

Result: 翻译的基准可能会掩盖适当的社会文化背景下真正的多语言数学能力。通过广泛的实验表明，该框架可以帮助减轻以英语为中心的实体偏差，并在跨各种语言引入原生实体时提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于减轻以英语为中心的实体偏差，并在跨各种语言引入原生实体时提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced data resources, using Slovene as a use case

Method: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset

Result: Fine-tuned model achieved a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02 compared to the baseline models, and more consistently avoids language and formatting errors.

Conclusion: The fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset generation, achieving a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, and more consistently avoids language and formatting errors.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiCoXQL and Compass datasets to address the challenges of multilingual generalization and custom input support in ConvXAI systems. A new parsing approach is proposed and evaluated using various LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method. While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users' underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited.

Method: We propose a new parsing approach aimed at enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies.

Result: To bridge these gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one low-resource language. Furthermore, we present Compass, a new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.

Conclusion: We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass, employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately

### [6] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们引入了一种新算法，该算法在测试时对齐中以更低的成本实现更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决测试时对齐的效率瓶颈。

Method: 奖励转移推测采样 (SSS) 算法

Result: 利用对齐的草稿模型和未对齐的目标模型之间的分布偏移来恢复 RLHF 最优解，而无需实际获得它。

Conclusion: 该算法在测试时弱到强对齐实验中以显着降低的推理成本实现了卓越的黄金奖励分数，从而验证了其有效性和效率。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall is a three-stage framework for evaluating the completeness of machine-generated text, improving recall accuracy in long-form QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recall metrics often depend on lexical overlap, leading to errors, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations.

Method: A three-stage recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts, narrows candidate matches through filtering, and verifies alignment through entailment checks.

Result: Substantial improvements in recall accuracy on three challenging long-form QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: LongRecall improves recall accuracy over baselines on long-form QA benchmarks.

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

TL;DR: combining LLMs with combinatorial inference to address hallucinations and complex reasoning problems


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive nature.

Method: combining LLMs with combinatorial inference

Result: addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads to increased performance for challenging tasks

Conclusion: structured learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors created a new, large, high-quality math dataset from Common Crawl using a novel extraction pipeline, which improves model performance on math, code, and general reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math-focused datasets from Common Crawl suffer from degraded quality due to extraction issues. The authors aim to create a large-scale, high-quality mathematical corpus.

Method: The authors developed a domain-agnostic pipeline with layout-aware rendering and LLM-based cleaning to extract math across various formats and standardize notation.

Result: The Nemotron-CC-Math corpus surpasses existing open math datasets in size and quality. Pretraining on this corpus improves performance on MATH, MBPP+, MMLU, and MMLU-Stem.

Conclusion: The authors present a novel pipeline for extracting high-quality mathematical data from Common Crawl, resulting in the Nemotron-CC-Math corpus. Pretraining a Nemotron-T 8B model on this corpus yields significant performance gains on math, code, and general reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

TL;DR: identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Answering such questions require first identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate misleading answers because of hallucinations.

Method: an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations

Result: incorporating retrieved evidence is beneficial

Conclusion: generating and validating atomic assumptions yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the false assumptions

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

Motivation: 现有模型在处理需要深度推理、持续上下文理解、实体跟踪和多步骤指令跟随的复杂多轮视觉任务时面临挑战。现有基准测试未能捕捉到真实世界多模态交互的动态性和复杂性。

Method: 提出了CoLVLM Agent，一个通过迭代的“记忆-感知-计划-执行”循环增强LVLM的框架。

Result: CoLVLM Agent在MMDR-Bench上取得了优异的性能，平均人工评估得分为4.03，超过了GPT-4o（3.92）和Gemini 1.5 Pro（3.85）。

Conclusion: CoLVLM Agent在复杂的多模态交互中表现出色，优于GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro，证明了其模块化设计和迭代方法的有效性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken, a semantic-aware tokenization framework, reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency by considering the semantic structure of text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenization approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios.

Method: SemToken, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. It extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens. Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density.

Result: SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity and downstream accuracy on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103 and LongBench.

Conclusion: Semantic structure offers a promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large language models.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

TL;DR: Fin-PRM, a domain-specific reward model for finance, improves LLM reasoning in financial tasks, leading to performance gains in supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and test-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or STEM domains and fall short in domain-specific contexts like finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness.

Method: A domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM (Fin-PRM) is introduced to evaluate intermediate reasoning steps in financial tasks. It integrates step-level and trajectory-level reward supervision.

Result: Fin-PRM outperforms general-purpose PRMs and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models trained with Fin-PRM yield gains of 12.9% in supervised learning, 5.2% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1% in test-time performance.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized reward modeling is valuable for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Models trained with Fin-PRM show substantial improvements.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK通过通道级别的KV剪枝，减少了内存占用，提高了长序列处理的效率和准确性，且无需训练，易于集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常忽略了特征维度上的细粒度重要性变化（即通道轴），从而限制了它们有效平衡效率和模型准确性的能力。

Method: 提出SPARK，一种无需训练的即插即用方法，通过在通道级别剪枝KV来应用非结构化稀疏性，同时在注意力分数计算期间动态恢复剪枝的条目。

Result: SPARK通过减少通道级别的冗余，能够在相同的内存预算内处理更长的序列。对于相同长度的序列，SPARK不仅保持或提高了模型准确性，而且与基于eviction的方法相比，减少了超过30%的KV缓存存储。

Conclusion: SPARK在保持或提高模型准确性的同时，与基于eviction的方法相比，减少了超过30%的KV缓存存储。即使在80%的激进剪枝率下，SPARK的性能退化也小于5%，表明了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its

### [15] [Select to Know: An Internal-External Knowledge Self-Selection Framework for Domain-Specific Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15213)
*Bolei He,Xinran He,Run Shao,Shanfu Shu,Xianwei Xue,Mingquan Cheng,Haifeng Li,Zhenhua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: S2K is a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through self-selection and selective fine-tuning, outperforming existing methods in domain-specific QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in domain-specific scenarios due to the long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, leading to underutilized internal knowledge. Knowledge acquisition should be progressive.

Method: internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised fine-tuning, structured reasoning data generation pipeline, GRPO

Result: S2K outperforms existing methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost on medical, legal, and financial QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: S2K consistently outperforms existing methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

*Sijia Cui,Aiyao He,Shuai Xu,Hongming Zhang,Yanna Wang,Qingyang Zhang,Yajing Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEER通过从不断更新的经验池中逐步检索信息，改进了LLM在多步骤工具使用中的工具选择、参数生成和工具链规划能力，并在ToolQA和τ-bench基准测试中取得了显著的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当面临多步骤工具使用时，LLM仍然难以进行工具选择、参数生成和工具链规划。现有方法通常依赖于手动设计特定于任务的演示，或从精选的库中检索。随着工具多样性和任务难度的增加，这些方法需要大量的专家努力，并且提示工程变得越来越复杂和低效。

Method: 提出了一种自引导方法，即Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER)，该方法从持续更新的经验池中执行细粒度的、逐步的检索。SEER以过去的成功轨迹逐步扩充经验池，从而能够持续扩展池并提高模型性能。

Result: SEER在ToolQA基准测试中取得了平均6.1%（简单问题）和4.7%（困难问题）的改进。在τ-bench上，SEER分别展示了7.44%和23.38%的显著准确率提升。

Conclusion: SEER在ToolQA和τ-bench上进行了评估，结果表明，SEER在ToolQA上，简单问题的平均改进为6.1%，困难问题的平均改进为4.7%。在τ-bench上，由Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-72B模型驱动，SEER分别展示了7.44%和23.38%的显著准确率提升。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

### [17] [Are Checklists Really Useful for Automatic Evaluation of Generative Tasks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15218)
*Momoka Furuhashi,Kouta Nakayama,Takashi Kodama,Saku Sugawara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effectiveness of checklists in evaluating generative tasks using large language models, finding that selective checklist use improves pairwise comparison but has inconsistent benefits in direct scoring. The study also reveals potential inconsistencies in human evaluation, highlighting the need for clearer evaluation criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored.

Method: automatic checklist generation using six methods

Result: identified checklist items that correlate with human evaluations.selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in direct scoring.checklist items with low correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria

Conclusion: Selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in direct scoring. Even checklist items with low correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human and automatic evaluations.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

*Hanling Zhang,Yayu Zhou,Tongcheng Fang,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor 通过卸载嵌入和混合词汇选择，显著减少了小型语言模型中与词汇相关的组件的内存使用，同时保持了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型 (SLM) 在资源受限的环境中提供计算优势，但内存限制仍然是边缘设备部署的关键瓶颈。由于词汇量大，SLM 的大部分内存占用来自与词汇相关的组件，特别是嵌入和语言建模 (LM) 头。

Method: VocabTailor，一种新颖的解耦动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入来解决内存限制，并为 LM Head 实施混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，从而能够按需加载词汇组件。

Result: VocabTailor 能够在词汇相关组件的内存使用量上减少高达 99%，同时任务性能几乎没有下降或没有下降，大大优于现有的静态词汇修剪。

Conclusion: VocabTailor 能够在词汇相关组件的内存使用量上减少高达 99%，同时任务性能几乎没有下降或没有下降，大大优于现有的静态词汇修剪。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

TL;DR: WangchanThaiInstruct 是一个人工撰写的泰语数据集，用于评估和指令调整。在 WangchanThaiInstruct 上微调的模型优于使用翻译数据的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型擅长英语的指令跟随，但它们在泰语等低资源语言中的性能仍未得到充分探索。现有的基准通常依赖于翻译，缺少实际使用所需的文化和领域特定细微差别。

Method: 人工创建的泰语数据集，用于评估和指令调整，涵盖四个专业领域和七个任务类型。通过与注释者、领域专家和 AI 研究人员进行的多阶段质量控制流程创建

Result: 零样本评估显示了在文化和专业特定任务上的性能差距。使用 WangchanThaiInstruct 进行指令调整研究，通过消融实验分离了本地监督的效果

Conclusion: 在 WangchanThaiInstruct 上微调的模型在领域内和跨领域的基准测试中优于使用翻译数据的模型。需要在文化和专业上扎根的指令数据，以提高在低资源、语言多样性环境中大型语言模型的对齐。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniCoM, a pipeline for generating code-switching samples, and uses it to create CS-FLEURS, a multilingual corpus for ASR and S2TT. CS-FLEURS demonstrates high quality and naturalness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of suitable datasets.

Method: We propose Universal Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech-to-text translation (S2TT).

Result: CS-FLEURS achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics.

Conclusion: CS-FLEURS achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual systems.

Motivation: Comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation in these contexts remains lacking.

Method: an Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft prompt injection. Extends existing scales and constructs 88 teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and vulnerability in teacher SP.

Result: Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations. Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection, revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.

*Eunseong Choi,June Park,Hyeri Lee,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CARE, a method to mitigate context-memory conflicts in RAG systems. It uses a context assessor to discern unreliable context and guide reasoning, achieving a 5.0% performance gain on QA and fact-checking benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict.

Method: We introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation (CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward the more reliable knowledge source.

Result: CARE effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average performance gain of 5.0% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks.

Conclusion: CARE effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average performance gain of 5.0% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TComQA, a new dataset for temporal commonsense reasoning, created using LLMs. A model trained on TComQA outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is often not explicitly stated in natural language. Recent studies indicate that even advanced large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text. Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the creation of robust language models.

Method: a temporal commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA

Result: TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing and achieves over 80% precision in extracting temporal commonsense.

Conclusion: The model trained with TComQA outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on an existing dataset.

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of

Motivation: manual creation of scientific survey articles is becoming increasingly infeasible due to the rapid growth of academic literature; progress in this area is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols

Method: introduce SurGE, a new benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation; propose an automated evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions: information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and content quality

Result: evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that survey generation remains highly challenging

Conclusion: Survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection frameworks.

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many speech processing tasks require pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence

Method: a lightweight model that captures key phoneme features in just 120 milliseconds

Result: achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages

Conclusion: effective universal speech processing is possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length windows

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

TL;DR: Bangla stemming research is lacking despite the language's need for it. This paper surveys existing approaches and suggests future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangla faces digital under-representation due to limited resources and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages like Bangla to reduce complexity.

Method: Conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches.

Result: Highlights a significant gap in existing literature, discontinuity from previous research, scarcity of accessible implementations, and critiques of evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: Advocates for robust Bangla stemmers and continued research to enhance language analysis and processing.

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EDAS, a new meta-metric for evaluating Knowledge Graph Completion models that addresses the challenges of comparing performance across multiple datasets and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparing KGC models across multiple datasets and metrics is challenging due to conflicting rankings. Traditional metrics focus on isolated aspects of performance, hindering holistic comparisons. There is a need for a unified meta-metric that integrates performance across all metrics and datasets.

Method: The paper introduces KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS).

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset performance into a unified ranking.

Conclusion: The paper proposes KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized score, offering a consistent, robust, and generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Conclusion: 当前基准测试存在由数据污染导致的分数膨胀、因文化和语言偏见导致的不公平评估以及缺乏对过程可信度和动态环境的评估等问题，并为未来的基准测试创新提供可参考的设计范例。

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design

TL;DR: MultiTrust-X benchmark reveals trustworthiness issues in MLLMs. RESA improves safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an intense concern, and existing approaches often focus on narrow aspects.

Method: Propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark with a three-dimensional framework, including 32 tasks and 28 curated datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal vulnerabilities in current models and limitations in existing mitigation strategies. Reasoning improves safety and performance.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have significant vulnerabilities, with mitigation strategies often introducing trade-offs. A Reasoning-Enhanced Safety Alignment (RESA) approach improves trustworthiness.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### [30] [Confidence-Modulated Speculative Decoding for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15371)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a confidence-modulated speculative decoding method that dynamically adjusts drafting lengths and verification criteria based on uncertainty, leading to speedups and improved performance in machine translation and summarization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on static drafting lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across varying model uncertainties and input complexities.

Method: This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each iteration. Additionally, the verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation quality.

Result: Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or improving BLEU and ROUGE scores.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a principled, plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under varying conditions of uncertainty.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

### [31] [Exploiting Vocabulary Frequency Imbalance in Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15390)
*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 更大的词汇量降低了token化文本的复杂性，主要通过减少常见词的不确定性来提高性能，模型利用token频率的不平衡获益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用tokenizers进行训练，由此产生的token分布高度不平衡。最近的实践倾向于越来越大的词汇量，但收益的来源尚不清楚。

Method: 通过控制实验，在固定数据、计算和优化的情况下，将语言模型的词汇量从24K扩展到196K，量化token化文本的复杂性，并通过词级损失分解来分析性能。

Result: 较大的词汇量减少了token化文本的复杂性。在24K以上，每个常用词都已经是一个单token，因此进一步的增长主要加深了相对token频率的不平衡。较大的词汇量几乎完全通过降低2500个最常用词的不确定性来减少交叉熵，即使尾部稀有词的损失上升。因为相同的常用词覆盖了下游基准测试中大约77%的token，所以这种训练优势完整地转移了。

Conclusion: 更大的词汇量通过降低常见词的不确定性来减少交叉熵，从而提高性能。通过约束输入和输出嵌入范数来减弱token频率不平衡的影响，逆转了增益，直接表明该模型利用而不是遭受不平衡的影响。扩大具有固定词汇量的模型参数会产生相同的频繁词优势。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LALMs在处理不一致的音频文本时偏向文本，需要改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型(LALMs)具备了音频感知能力，可以有效处理和理解结合了音频和文本的多模态输入。然而，它们在处理音频和文本模态之间冲突信息方面的性能在很大程度上仍未得到检验。

Method: 提出了MCR-BENCH基准测试，用于评估LALMs在面对不一致的音频文本对时如何进行信息优先级排序。

Result: LALMs在模态不一致时，对文本输入表现出明显的偏见，经常忽略音频证据。在以音频为中心的任务中，这种倾向导致了严重的性能下降。

Conclusion: LALMs在处理不一致的音频文本对时，过度依赖文本输入，忽略音频证据，导致音频相关任务性能下降。需要改进训练过程中的模态平衡和更复杂的信息融合机制。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Motivation: 大型语音语言模型 (LSLM) 的发展因架构分散和缺乏透明度而受阻，从而妨碍了研究的系统比较和可重复性。与视觉语言领域不同，LSLM 领域普遍存在发布模型权重而不发布相应的训练数据和配置的现象。

Method: 构建并发布了一个 3.8B 参数的参考模型 LLaSO-Base，该模型仅使用公共数据进行训练。

Result: LLaSO-Base 的归一化得分为 0.72，建立了一个强大的、可重现的基线，超过了同类模型。分析表明，虽然更广泛的训练覆盖范围可以提高性能，但在未见过的任务（尤其是在纯音频场景中）中，仍然存在显著的泛化差距。

Conclusion: LLaSO 通过发布完整的数据、基准和模型堆栈，建立了一个基础的开放标准，以统一研究工作，并加速 LSLM 中社区驱动的进展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

The dataset goes beyond traditional labels by identifying not only help-seeking
activity but also specific mental health disorders and their underlying causes,
such as relationship challenges or financial stressors. AI models trained on
M-Help can address three key tasks: identifying help-seekers, diagnosing mental
health conditions, and uncovering the root causes of issues.

Method: PyTOD 使用生成可执行代码来跟踪对话状态，并使用策略和执行反馈来进行有效的错误纠正。PyTOD 采用了一种简单的约束解码方法，使用语言模型而不是语法规则来遵循 API 模式。

Result: PyTOD 在具有挑战性的 SGD 基准上实现了最先进的状态跟踪性能。

Conclusion: PyTOD在对话进行过程中，在准确性和鲁棒的用户目标估计方面超越了强大的基线，证明了执行感知状态跟踪的有效性。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radiology report evaluation methods lack clinically grounded, interpretable, and fine-grained metrics, producing coarse scores or using opaque black-box models.

Method: RadReason, a novel evaluation framework, uses Group Relative Policy Optimization with Sub-score Dynamic Weighting and Majority-Guided Advantage Scaling.

Result: RadReason outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six clinically defined error types and provides human-readable justifications for each score.

Conclusion: RadReason surpasses prior offline metrics and matches GPT-4 evaluations on the ReXVal benchmark, while being explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 个性化营销已成为提高客户参与度和推动业务增长的关键战略。个性化的这一方面具有提高转化率和提高客户满意度的巨大潜力。先前的研究表明，执行良好的个性化策略可以将收入提高多达 40%，这突显了开发智能的、数据驱动的提议生成方法在战略上的重要性。

Method: 通过使用对比学习方法微调预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型（特别是谷歌的文本到文本传输转换器 (T5-Small 60M)）开发的用于个性化提议生成的生成式人工智能模型 SLM4Offer。

Result: 实验结果表明，提议接受率比监督微调基线提高了 17%。

Conclusion: SLM4Offer 模型在提议接受率上比监督微调基线提高了 17%，突出了对比目标在推进个性化营销方面的有效性。

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Motivation: question the perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic browsing of websites or apps

Method: clusterwise LM training, HeTLM

Result: a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters

Conclusion: clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate for subjective behaviors, can achieve higher mean and a lower variance in generation, implying improved alignment.

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curriculum learning has shown limited success for pre-training language models.

Method: sorting training examples by their training data influence, a score which estimates the effect of individual training examples on the model's output

Result: Models trained on our curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10 percentage points in benchmarks

Conclusion: curriculum learning is beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric notion of difficulty is adopted

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入了第一个多标签希伯来语语料库 HebID，用于社会身份检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的群体和身份检测数据集主要以英语为中心，单标签，并且侧重于粗略的身份类别。政治语言与社会身份密切相关，而社会身份通常受到特定文化背景的影响，并通过特定的语言使用来表达。

Method: 创建了第一个多标签希伯来语语料库 HebID，用于社会身份检测。使用了来自以色列政治家 Facebook 帖子的 5,536 个句子，并手动注释了 12 个细微的社会身份。

Result: 希伯来语调整的 LLM 提供了最佳结果（宏 $F_1$ = 0.74）。将分类器应用于政治家的 Facebook 帖子和议会演讲，评估了身份表达在受欢迎程度、时间趋势、聚类模式和性别相关变化方面的差异。

Conclusion: HebID语料库为研究希伯来语的社会身份提供了一个全面的基础，并且可以作为其他非英语政治背景下的类似研究的模型。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 介绍Dream 7B，这是迄今为止最强大的开放扩散大型语言模型。

Method: 采用离散扩散建模，通过迭代去噪并行地优化序列。

Result: Dream 7B在各项任务中表现出色，并具有任意顺序生成、填充能力和可调整的质量-速度权衡等特性。通过基于AR的LLM初始化和上下文自适应令牌级噪声重新调度等简单而有效的训练技术来实现这些结果。

Conclusion: Dream 7B在通用、数学和编码任务上优于现有的扩散语言模型，展示了卓越的规划能力和推理灵活性。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政治合法性丧失话语 (PDD)，即对政治实体规范有效性的象征性攻击。

Method: 结合微调编码器模型和解码器 LLM 的两阶段分类管道。最好的模型 (DictaLM 2.0) 在二元 PDD 检测中达到 0.74 的 F1 值，在合法性丧失特征分类中达到 0.67 的 macro-F1 值。

Result: 在过去三十年中，PDD 显著上升；社交媒体比议会辩论更普遍；男性政治家比女性政治家更多地使用；右倾行为者有更强的趋势——在竞选活动和重大政治事件期间出现明显的峰值。

Conclusion: 自动化政治合法性丧失话语 (PDD) 分析对于理解民主话语的可行性和价值。

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

### [48] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new training objective for facial landmark detection that outperforms existing methods by converging faster and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heatmap regression-based methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax, to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. This work revisits this choice and demonstrates that it is not the only way to achieve strong performance.

Method: An alternative training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework is proposed.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像分类方法，该方法结合了GCN和Voronoi图，在复杂场景和细粒度类别中优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类的快速进展主要由图卷积网络 (GCN) 的采用所驱动，GCN 为处理复杂数据结构提供了强大的框架。

Method: 将GCN与Voronoi图集成，通过利用它们有效建模关系数据的能力来增强图像分类。图像表示为图，其中像素或区域充当顶点。然后使用相应的Delaunay三角剖分细化这些图，从而优化它们的表示。

Result: 所提出的模型在各种基准数据集上的预处理效率和分类精度均实现了显着改进，超过了最先进的方法，尤其是在涉及复杂场景和细粒度类别的具有挑战性的场景中。

Conclusion: 结合GCN和Voronoi图的方法在图像分类中表现出色，为计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中基于图的学习范式扩展了潜在应用。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [50] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一种单阶段、基于查询的框架，用于类别级9-DoF估计，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数现有的解决方案仍然依赖于伪深度、CAD模型或将2D检测与姿态估计分离的多阶段级联。我们需要一种更简单的、纯RGB的替代方案，可以直接在类别级别学习。

Method: YOPO是一种单阶段、基于查询的框架，它将类别级9-DoF估计视为2D检测的自然扩展。YOPO用一个轻量级的姿态头、一个边界框条件平移模块和一个6D感知的匈牙利匹配成本来增加一个transformer检测器。该模型仅使用RGB图像和类别级姿态标签进行端到端训练。

Result: YOPO在三个基准测试中建立了新的技术水平。在REAL275数据集上，它在10°10cm指标下实现了79.6%的IoU50和54.1%，超过了之前的纯RGB方法，并缩小了与RGB-D系统的差距。

Conclusion: YOPO在三个基准测试中建立了新的技术水平，在REAL275数据集上实现了79.6%的IoU50和54.1%的10°10cm指标，超越了之前的纯RGB方法，并缩小了与RGB-D系统的差距。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern face recognition systems are vulnerable to spoofing attempts, and traditional methods handle physical and digital attacks separately, increasing system complexity and leaving systems exposed to combined attack vectors.

Method: The paper proposes a unified training approach called Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework that leverages automatically matched pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.

Result: The proposed method achieves an ACER of 2.10 percent on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital Attack Detection benchmark. The framework is lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour.

Conclusion: The proposed Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital Attack Detection benchmark, with an ACER of 2.10 percent.

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen 是一种高效的、免训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，它利用扩散模型在少量采样步骤内生成高质量的对抗样本，并在攻击效果和速度上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的对抗攻击通常产生低质量的图像并需要大量的计算资源。扩散模型虽然能够生成高质量的图像，但通常需要数百个采样步骤来进行对抗生成。

Method: TAIGen 是一种免训练的黑盒方法，它通过在混合步骤间隔中注入扰动，并结合选择性的 RGB 通道策略来生成对抗样本。

Result: TAIGen 仅需 3-20 个采样步骤即可从无条件扩散模型生成对抗样本。在 ImageNet 上，以 VGGNet 为源，TAIGen 对 ResNet 的攻击成功率为 70.6%，对 MNASNet 的攻击成功率为 80.8%，对 ShuffleNet 的攻击成功率为 97.8%。

Conclusion: TAIGen在保持图像质量的同时，实现了比现有基于扩散的攻击快 10 倍的对抗样本生成速度，并且对防御机制的规避能力最强。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐蔽视觉感知 (CVP) 方法通常利用可逆策略来降低不确定性，但这些方法通常仅限于掩码域，而 RGB 域的潜力尚未充分开发。

Method: RUN++ 包含三个模块： Concealed Object Region Extraction (CORE), Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE), and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE).

Result: RUN++ 能够高效地关注模糊区域，显著减少假阳性和假阴性。

Conclusion: RUN++ 通过展开网络和扩散模型的协同作用，能够高效地关注模糊区域，显著减少假阳性和假阴性。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

TL;DR: CurveFlow 是一种新的流动匹配框架，通过引入曲率引导来学习平滑的非线性轨迹，从而显著提高了文本到图像生成的语义一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的修正流动模型基于数据和噪声分布之间的线性轨迹。这种线性强制零曲率，可能会无意中迫使图像生成过程通过数据流形的低概率区域。一个关键问题仍未得到充分探索：这些轨迹的曲率与生成的图像及其对应标题之间的语义对齐（即指令依从性）有何关系？

Method: CurveFlow，一种新颖的流动匹配框架，旨在通过将曲率引导直接纳入流动路径来学习平滑的非线性轨迹。该方法具有强大的曲率正则化技术，可惩罚轨迹内在动力学的突变。

Result: 在 MS COCO 2014 和 2017 上的大量实验表明，CurveFlow 在文本到图像生成方面取得了最先进的性能，显着优于标准修正流动变体和其他非线性基线（如修正扩散）。改进在语义一致性指标（如 BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE 和 CLAIR）中尤为明显。

Conclusion: CurveFlow通过引入曲率感知建模，显著提高了模型在保持高质量图像的同时，忠实地遵循复杂指令的能力。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据集偏差和对主观标签的依赖继续阻碍了它们（NR-IQA）的泛化性能。

Method: HiRQA，分层排序和质量对齐），一个自我监督的、与意见无关的框架，通过结合排序和对比学习，提供分层的、质量感知的嵌入。

Result: HiRQA有效地推广到真实的退化，并通过对各种失真的评估（如镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊和弱光条件）证明了这一点。对于实时部署，我们推出了 HiRQA-S，这是一种轻量级变体，每次推理时间仅为 3.5 毫秒。

Conclusion: HiRQA在合成和真实的基准测试中验证了最先进的 (SOTA) 性能、强大的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use cases. Reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational adversities of edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained degradation of reconstruction quality.

Method: a novel portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy

The proposed method demonstrates benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Conclusion: The proposed camera selection strategy guarantees reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

TL;DR: XDR-LVLM利用视觉-语言大模型进行DR诊断，提供自然语言解释，实现了高精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在DR检测中缺乏透明性和可解释性，阻碍了临床应用。

Method: XDR-LVLM集成了医学视觉编码器、LVLM核心，并采用多任务提示工程和多阶段微调。

Result: XDR-LVLM在DDR数据集上取得了最先进的性能，疾病诊断的平衡准确率为84.55%，F1得分为79.92%，概念检测的BACC为77.95%，F1为66.88%。

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM在DR诊断中表现出色，通过提供可解释的见解弥合了自动化诊断和临床需求之间的差距。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

TL;DR: 提出 MeSS 方法，利用城市网格模型作为几何先验，生成高质量、风格一致的室外场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网格模型在许多城市中变得越来越容易获得；然而，缺乏逼真的纹理限制了它们在虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种名为 MeSS（基于网格的场景合成）的方法，用于生成高质量、风格一致的室外场景，其中城市网格模型作为几何先验。该流程包括三个关键阶段：首先，使用 Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets 生成几何上一致的稀疏视图；其次，通过名为 AGInpaint 的组件传播更密集的中间视图；第三，使用 GCAlign 模块全局消除视觉不一致性（例如，不同的曝光）。在生成的同时，通过在网格表面上初始化高斯球来重建 3D 高斯溅射 (3DGS) 场景。

Result: 该方法在几何对齐和生成质量方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在几何对齐和生成质量方面优于现有方法。合成后，可以通过重新照明和风格迁移技术以不同的风格渲染场景。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired

learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Conclusion: DyMorph-B2I 优于单独的经典方法和简单组合，实现了卓越的实例分离，并有助于肾脏病理工作流程中更准确的形态测量分析。

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Motivation: 事故预测和及时预警在提高道路安全方面起着关键作用，通过降低道路使用者的受伤风险和最大限度地减少财产损失。先进的驾驶员辅助系统(ADAS)旨在支持人类驾驶员，当他们能够预测潜在的事故时，尤其有用。许多现有的系统依赖于各种传感器，如激光雷达、雷达和GPS，但仅依赖行车记录仪视频输入提出了一种更具挑战性但更具成本效益且易于部署的解决方案。

Method: 使用循环网络整合更好的时空特征，以改进用于预测dash-cam视频中事故的最先进的图神经网络。

Conclusion: STAGNet模型在三个公共数据集上进行了实验，结果表明，无论是在给定数据集上进行交叉验证，还是在不同数据集上进行训练和测试，该模型都比以前的方法实现了更高的平均精度和平均碰撞时间值。

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriMM是一个前馈3D原生生成模型，它从多模态数据（RGB、RGBD 和点云）中学习，以生成高质量的 3D 资产。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数3D原生生成架构要么主要在单模态范例中运行，因此忽略了多模态数据的互补优势，要么将自己限制为3D结构，从而限制了可用训练数据集的范围。为了全面利用多模态进行3D建模，我们提出了TriMM，这是第一个从基本多模态（例如，RGB，RGBD和点云）中学习的前馈3D原生生成模型。

Method: TriMM采用三平面潜在扩散模型，以生成高质量的3D资产，从而增强纹理和几何细节。TriMM首先引入协作多模态编码，该编码集成了模态特定特征，同时保留了其独特的表示强度。此外，引入辅助2D和3D监督，以提高多模态编码的鲁棒性和性能。

Result: 在多个著名数据集上的大量实验表明，TriMM具有竞争力。

Conclusion: TriMM通过有效利用多模态，实现了与在大型数据集上训练的模型相媲美的性能，尽管它使用少量训练数据。在最近的RGB-D数据集上进行了额外的实验，验证了将其他多模态数据集纳入3D生成的可能性。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods try to solve this problem through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem

Method: a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning module

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Method: Introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). Construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising 13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with target-oriented language instructions.

Result: The dataset includes both unseen maps and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.

Conclusion: Propose a dual-UAV collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种加速扩散模型采样的新方法，称为跳步采样，该方法通过跳过中间去噪步骤来实现更快的生成速度，同时保持高质量的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在各种生成任务中都取得了最先进的结果。然而，一个明显的缺点是它们的顺序生成过程，需要长序列的逐步生成。现有的方法，如 DDIM，试图通过构建一类保持相同训练目标的非马尔可夫扩散过程来减少采样步骤。然而，对于原始扩散过程是否可以在不求助于非马尔可夫过程的情况下实现相同的效率，仍然存在差距。

Method: 本文提出了一种跳步采样机制，该机制绕过了迭代生成过程中的多个中间去噪步骤，这与标准扩散推理的传统逐步细化形成对比。此外，通过将加速采样技术与 DDIM 相结合，提出了一种增强的生成方法。

Result: 跳步采样机制源自与标准扩散模型相同的训练目标，表明通过马尔可夫方式通过跳步采样进行加速采样是预训练扩散模型的内在属性。

Conclusion: 该方法在流行的预训练扩散模型（包括 OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion 和 Open Sora 模型）上进行了大量实验，表明该方法以显着减少的采样步骤实现了高质量的生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Conclusion: The proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile, it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence (AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing methods adopt a first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision.

Method: restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the cross-attention and self-attention layers and instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with independent parameters

Result: RATopo strategy consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance on OpenLane-V2

Conclusion: RATopo strategy is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance.

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

### [71] [TPA: Temporal Prompt Alignment for Fetal Congenital Heart Defect Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15298)
*Darya Taratynova,Alya Almsouti,Beknur Kalmakhanbet,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPA: A new method for fetal CHD classification in ultrasound videos using temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification. Achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not account for prediction calibration.

Method: Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies classification uncertainty.

Result: achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to 58.62%).

Conclusion: Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BasketLiDAR, a new multimodal dataset for basketball player tracking, and a novel MOT framework that improves tracking accuracy and reduces computational cost by using LiDAR and camera data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball, in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field, as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.

Method: A novel MOT algorithm that leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. It consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data.

Result: The approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking performance even under occlusion conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves real-time operation and superior tracking performance, even under occlusion conditions.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

*Wutao Liu,YiDan Wang,Pan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RAG-SEG的无训练COD范例，该范例利用检索增强生成（RAG）生成粗略mask作为提示，然后进行基于SAM的分割（SEG）以进行细化，无需大量训练即可实现与现有技术相媲美的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于物体和背景之间的高度相似性，伪装物体检测（COD）在计算机视觉中提出了一个重大挑战。现有的方法通常依赖于大量的训练和大量的计算资源。虽然像Segment Anything Model（SAM）这样的基础模型提供了强大的泛化能力，但如果没有微调，它们仍然难以处理COD任务，并且需要高质量的提示才能产生良好的性能。然而，手动生成这些提示是昂贵且低效的。

Method: 提出了一种无训练范例，将COD解耦为两个阶段：检索增强生成（RAG）和基于SAM的分割（SEG）。RAG-SEG通过无监督聚类构建了一个紧凑的检索数据库，实现了快速有效的特征检索。

Result: 检索到的特征产生伪标签，引导使用SAM2进行精确的mask生成。该方法消除了传统训练的需要，同时保持了竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG在基准COD数据集上表现与最先进的方法相当或超过了它们。所有实验都在个人笔记本电脑上进行，突出了该方法的计算效率和实用性。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoEraser是一个无需训练的框架，可以防止T2V扩散模型生成带有不良概念的视频，即使在明确提示这些概念时也是如此。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于文本到视频（T2V）扩散模型可能被滥用于生成有害或误导性内容，因此它们的快速增长引起了对隐私、版权和安全的担忧。

Method: 提出了VideoEraser，这是一个无需训练的框架，通过选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）和对抗性噪声引导（ARNG）的两阶段过程，可以无缝地与代表性的T2V扩散模型集成。

Result: 在对象擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和显式内容擦除这四个任务中进行了广泛的评估。实验结果表明，在功效、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面，VideoEraser始终优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: VideoEraser在抑制T2V生成过程中不希望的内容方面实现了最先进的性能，与基线相比，在四个任务中的平均降低了46%。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Video-LLMs to understand how they process video, finding that early layers extract video information, specific intermediate layers are critical, and language guides spatial-temporal modeling more than video self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video-LLM research focuses on performance, with limited understanding of internal mechanisms.

Method: The study uses attention knockouts (Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and Language-to-Video Knockout) applied to different layers of Video-LLMs in global and fine-grained settings.

Result: Key findings: (1) Video information extraction occurs in early layers; lower layers focus on perceptual encoding, higher layers on abstract reasoning. (2) Certain intermediate layers have an outsized impact. (3) Spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval than video self-attention. These insights can reduce attention computation.

Conclusion: This study uncovers how Video-LLMs internally process and understand video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future research.

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DGS压缩方法存在两个局限性：(1) 它们仅将中等规模的场景压缩到兆字节范围，这对于大规模场景或广泛的场景集合仍然不实用；(2) 它们缺乏在长期存档后适应场景变化的机制。

Method: 提出了一种图像条件高斯溅射量化器 (ICGS-Quantizer)

Result: ICGS-Quantizer有效地将 3DGS 的存储需求降低到千字节范围，同时保持了视觉保真度。

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和适应场景变化方面始终优于现有技术。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveSplat is introduced to address the issues of limited robustness in rendering novel views and the lack of accurate geometric representation in 3D scene reconstruction for driving scenarios. It uses dynamic-static decoupling and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric representation.

Method: A high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. A region-wise voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near, middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation. Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors, whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network. The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Conclusion: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios on Waymo and KITTI datasets.

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the limitations of the DIO model in solving RPM problems and proposes three improvement methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models have a bottleneck in abstract reasoning. Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems are used as a benchmark for evaluating abstract reasoning capabilities.

Method: The paper adopts a ``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes $\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency $\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture of the baseline model DIO is designed.

Result: Experiments reveal that the optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option, fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning logic.

Conclusion: This paper identifies limitations in the DIO model's ability to acquire human reasoning logic due to the tightness of the lower bound in mutual information maximization and the inability of mutual information to capture causal relationships. It proposes three progressive improvement methods to address these limitations.

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

We present a Variational Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce overfitting.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了输入分辨率对三种基于深度学习的人脸检测器（YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN）的准确性和鲁棒性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸检测是许多人工智能驱动应用中的关键组成部分，例如监控、生物特征认证和人机交互。然而，低分辨率图像等现实条件带来了显著的挑战，降低了检测性能。

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，我们对多个图像分辨率（160x160、320x320和640x640）进行了广泛的评估，并使用精确率、召回率、mAP50、mAP50-95和推理时间等指标评估了每个模型的性能。

Result: 结果表明，YOLOv11在检测精度方面优于YOLOv12和MTCNN，尤其是在较高分辨率下，而YOLOv12表现出稍微好一点的召回率。MTCNN虽然在landmark定位方面具有竞争力，但在实时推理速度方面滞后。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

### [85] [Bidirectional Temporal Information Propagation for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15415)
*Dengyan Luo,Yanping Xiang,Hu Wang,Luping Ji. Shuai Li,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BIRD, a bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving infrared small target detection, which outperforms existing methods by jointly optimizing the entire video clip and considering both local and global temporal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based multi-frame methods for infrared small target detection use sliding windows, which ignore global temporal information and lead to redundant computation and sub-optimal performance.

Method: The paper proposes a Bidirectional temporal information propagation method (BIRD) that uses Local and Global Temporal Motion Fusion modules and is optimized with a Spatio-Temporal Fusion loss.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the BIRD method.

Conclusion: The proposed BIRD method achieves state-of-the-art performance and fast inference speed.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

*Danish Zia Baig,Mohsin Kamal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a YOLOv8 based deep learning solution for detecting microscopic dents on car exteriors, achieving high accuracy and low latency suitable for real-time applications using a custom dataset and data augmentation techniques. The YOLOv8m-t42 model showed the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual, and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents. Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for quicker and more precise inspection methods. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual, time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created.

Method: The paper uses the YOLOv8 object recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car exteriors. To improve robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.

Result: Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. With a precision of 0.86, recall of 0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4 model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).

Conclusion: YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MATR模型用于视频到视频时刻检索，并在两个数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频到视频时刻检索任务需要语义帧级别对齐和建模查询和目标视频之间的复杂依赖关系。

Method: 提出了基于Transformer的MATR模型，使用双阶段序列对齐来编码相关性和依赖性，并使用自监督预训练技术。

Result: MATR在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上R@1提升13.1%，mIoU提升8.1%，在SportsMoments数据集上R@1提升14.7%，mIoU提升14.4%。

Conclusion: MATR在ActivityNet-VRL和SportsMoments数据集上显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需 SfM 的 3DGS 方法，用于从极稀疏视图中进行新视角合成，通过密集立体、相干视图插值和多尺度正则化来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) 在新视角合成中表现出了卓越的实时性能，但其有效性在很大程度上依赖于具有精确已知相机姿势的密集多视角输入，这在现实场景中很少可用。当输入视图变得非常稀疏时，3DGS 依赖于初始化的运动结构 (SfM) 方法无法准确地重建场景的 3D 几何结构，从而导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于 SfM-free 3DGS 的方法，该方法可以从极稀疏视图输入中联合估计相机姿势并重建 3D 场景。具体来说，我们提出了一种密集立体模块，以逐步估计相机姿势信息并重建用于初始化的全局密集点云。为了解决极稀疏视图设置中固有的信息稀缺问题，我们提出了一种相干视图插值模块，该模块基于训练视图对插值相机姿势并生成视点一致的内容，作为训练的额外监督信号。此外，我们引入了多尺度拉普拉斯一致正则化和自适应空间感知多尺度几何正则化，以提高几何结构和渲染内容的质量。

Result: 该方法在极稀疏视图条件下显著优于其他最先进的基于 3DGS 的方法，在使用仅 2 个训练视图的极稀疏视图条件下，PSNR 实现了显着的 2.75dB 改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在极稀疏视图条件下显著优于其他最先进的基于 3DGS 的方法，在使用仅 2 个训练视图的极稀疏视图条件下，PSNR 实现了显着的 2.75dB 改进。该方法合成的图像表现出最小的失真，同时保留了丰富的高频细节，与现有技术相比，具有卓越的视觉质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: LGMSNet是一种新颖的轻量级框架，基于局部和全局双重多尺度，以最小的计算开销实现了最先进的性能，适用于资源受限的医疗场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的轻量级模型通常以牺牲性能换取效率，并且很少采用计算成本高的注意力机制，严重限制了它们的全局上下文感知能力。此外，当前的架构忽略了医学图像中相同卷积核下的通道冗余问题，阻碍了有效的特征提取。

Method: LGMSNet采用异构层内内核提取局部高频信息，并结合稀疏transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息。

Result: LGMSNet在六个公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并在四个未见数据集的zero-shot泛化测试中保持了出色的性能。

Conclusion: LGMSNet在六个公共数据集上优于现有方法，并在zero-shot泛化测试中表现出色，证明了其在资源受限的医疗场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

Conclusion: MExECON在保真度上始终优于单视图基线，并且与现代的少镜头3D重建方法相比，实现了具有竞争力的性能。

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

Motivation: Current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.

Method: The proposed method is AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning, which introduces Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion.

Result: Experiments on Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF) demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance.

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features, reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments on four MMIF tasks demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

Method: 一种结合了几何和生成先验的轨迹外推整体框架ExtraGS。该框架的核心是一种基于混合高斯-有符号距离函数(SDF)设计的新的道路表面高斯(RSG)表示，以及使用可学习的比例因子来有效处理远处物体的远场高斯(FFG)。此外，还开发了一种基于球面谐波的自监督不确定性估计框架，该框架能够仅在外推伪影发生的地方选择性地整合生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、不同的多摄像头设置和各种生成先验下进行的大量实验表明，

Conclusion: ExtraGS显著提高了外推视图的真实感和几何一致性，同时保持了原始轨迹的高保真度。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a computational framework where descriptive and prescriptive aspects of a world model co-emerge from an agent's goal, introducing the concept of telic states for goal-directed learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Canonical computational accounts of purposeful behavior posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation and a reward function. This paper explores the alternative possibility that these two aspects co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.

Method: A computational framework of goal-directed state representation is described, drawing on Buddhist epistemology to introduce telic states, defined as classes of goal-equivalent experience distributions.

Result: The paper reviews empirical and theoretical literature supporting the novel perspective of goal-directed state representation.

Conclusion: Telic states provide a parsimonious account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. This perspective offers a unified account of behavioral, phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors.

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

### [96] [Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15047)
*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an LLM-driven method for crowd simulation, enabling more realistic agent interactions and emergent group behaviors through dialogue and language-driven navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd animation work lacks consideration of language and dialogue's influence on human navigation, limiting agent interactions.

Method: This paper proposes a method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to control agents' movement, with a dialogue system and language-driven navigation.

Result: The method enables agents to make motion decisions based on perceptual inputs and ongoing dialogue, leading to realistic crowd simulations with emergent group behaviors.

Conclusion: This paper validates a novel method using LLMs to control agent movement in crowds, showing realistic group behaviors emerge naturally.

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在知识密集型任务中，信息获取比推理更重要，以提高置信度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 避免过度自信，作为问答工具的大型语言模型需要强大的校准。

Method: 使用 ClimateX 数据集，并将其扩展到人类和地球健康领域，系统地评估了推理能力和预算如何影响置信度评估的准确性。

Result: 扩展推理导致系统性的过度自信，随着思考预算的增加而恶化，产生递减和负回报。搜索增强生成明显优于纯推理，通过检索相关证据实现了 89.3% 的准确率。最近的推理 LLM 在评估专家置信度方面的准确率为 48.7%，但增加推理预算始终会损害而不是改善校准。

Conclusion: 信息获取，而非推理深度或预算，可能是提高知识密集型任务置信度校准的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA is a lightweight, data-free, and model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates, improving safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEFT techniques can compromise safety alignment in LLM-based agents, and existing safety-aware adaptation methods are often impractical due to the unavailability of base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints.

Method: Introduce Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD) to analyze LoRA updates and design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI) to detect and prune layers with potentially unsafe updates.

Result: S3LoRA improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility metrics and significantly reducing inference cost.

Conclusion: S3LoRA consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility metrics and significantly reducing inference cost, making it a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Motivation: 具身 AI 代理必须以可解释的方式推断和行动，以实现各种未预定义的人类目标和偏好。为了形式化这种设置，我们引入了开放世界辅助游戏 (OU-AG)，这是一个框架，代理必须在无限且不断发展的可能目标空间中进行推理。

Method: GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue)，一种数据高效的在线方法，可以在与人交互期间以自然语言的形式提取目标，并推断自然语言目标的分布。

Result: GOOD 提示 LLM 模拟具有不同复杂意图的用户，使用其响应对候选目标执行概率推理。这种方法无需大型离线数据集即可实现丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计。通过基于 LLM 和人工评估证实，我们的方法优于没有明确目标跟踪的基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在文本杂货店购物领域和文本操作的模拟家庭机器人环境 (AI2Thor) 中，通过合成用户配置文件进行评估，优于没有明确目标跟踪的基线。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for

Motivation: Applying LLMs to rare medical conditions like hyperhidrosis is hindered by scarce and unreliable datasets. No work has tailored LLMs to advance hyperhidrosis diagnosis or care.

Method: a three-stage pipeline: data augmentation using a frontier LLM to generate synthetic vignettes, fine-tuning an open-source foundation model, and inference and expert evaluation by clinical and psychological specialists.

Result: LLM4Sweat outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: LLM4Sweat outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with

TL;DR: Introduces SurgWound, the first open-source surgical wound dataset and benchmark, and proposes WoundQwen, a three-stage learning framework for surgical wound diagnosis using MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and the absence of a public surgical wound dataset hinder the development of open-source surgical wound screening tools. There is no benchmark encompassing various types of surgical wounds.

Method: A three-stage learning framework, WoundQwen, is proposed for surgical wound diagnosis. It employs multiple MLLMs to predict wound characteristics, diagnose outcomes, and generate comprehensive reports.

Result: The paper introduces SurgWound, the first open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It also introduces the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks. The three-stage framework can analyze detailed surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients based on surgical images.

Conclusion: The proposed three-stage framework, WoundQwen, can analyze detailed surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Motivation: 在资源、时间和运营约束下进行有效调度是跨资本项目、制造、物流和 IT 队列转换等领域进行大规模规划的基础。然而，大型语言模型 (LLM) 在高约束条件下进行推理时的可靠性尚未得到充分表征。

Method: R-ConstraintBench，一个可扩展的框架，用于评估资源约束项目调度问题 (RCPSP) 的模型，难度通过约束的线性增长来增加。

Result: 强大的模型在仅具有优先级的 DAG 上接近上限，但是当停机时间、时间窗口和析取约束相互作用时，可行性性能会崩溃，这意味着约束交互，而不是图深度，是主要的瓶颈。在干净的合成斜坡上的性能也不能保证转移到领域场景中，这表明泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在高度约束条件下推理时的可靠性不足；当停机时间、时间窗口和析取约束相互作用时，可行性性能会崩溃，这意味着约束交互是主要瓶颈；在干净的合成斜坡上的性能并不能保证转移到领域场景中，这表明泛化能力有限。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required for flowcharts, while sketch-to-diagram generation converts rough hand sketches into precise, compositional diagrams.

Method: The system couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs through an iterative loop.

Result: The method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) on 10 sketches derived from flowcharts, accurately composing primitives without inserting unwanted text.

Conclusion: The paper introduces See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic system that reconstructs layouts and structures more faithfully than frontier closed-source image generation LLMs, and outputs are programmatic SVGs.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

### [110] [Multiple Memory Systems for Enhancing the Long-term Memory of Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15294)
*Gaoke Zhang,Bo Wang,Yunlong Ma,Dongming Zhao,Zifei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multiple memory system (MMS) to improve the quality of long-term memory content for agents, enhancing their ability to utilize historical data. MMS constructs retrieval and contextual memory units and demonstrates its effectiveness on the LoCoMo dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during interactions remains a challenge. Existing methods, such as MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects recall performance and response quality.

Method: The authors designed a multiple memory system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments, with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase, MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively utilizing historical data.

Result: Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method with three others, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The MMS method's effectiveness is proven through experiments on the LoCoMo dataset, with ablation studies confirming the rationality of its memory units. Robustness analysis regarding the number of selected memory segments and storage overhead demonstrates its practical value.

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a coarse-to-fine grounded memory framework to improve LLM-based agents by leveraging multi-granularity memories for flexible adaptation and planning, especially when facing environmental anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works focus on single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions, which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences. This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the flexibility of planning.

Method: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (Ours), a novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM

Result: Ours grounds environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, Ours retrieves task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning.

Conclusion: When facing environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan correction.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan

*Xiancheng Gao,Yufeng Shi,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPW 统一了专家演示和偏好，以实现有效的离线强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常依赖于定义良好的奖励函数，而奖励函数的设计既困难又昂贵。人类反馈是一种有吸引力的替代方案，但它的两种常见形式，专家演示和偏好，具有互补的局限性。

Method: 引入了一种基于搜索的偏好加权 (SPW) 方案，以统一这两种反馈源。对于偏好标记轨迹中的每个转换，SPW 搜索来自专家演示的最相似状态-动作对，并直接基于它们的相似性分数导出逐步重要性权重。

Result: SPW实现了更准确的信用分配，这是传统方法难以实现的。

Conclusion: SPW实现了从偏好和演示中进行有效的联合学习，优于先前在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务中利用这两种反馈类型的方法。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Motivation: current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First, they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one plans with rich details.

Method: a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed TGMA

Result: even the strongest existing model achieves merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved performance 2.72%

Conclusion: TGMA demonstrates substantially improved performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel planning.

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text

symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of excessively long chains of thought in LLMs leading to overthinking, computational waste, and slower responses.

Method: The paper introduces a three-stage pipeline: Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning.

Result: The paper establishes a block-structured paradigm where the model predicts a reasoning budget and partitions its reasoning accordingly. The explicit block count is used to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a Think in Blocks framework that enables LLMs to adaptively adjust the length of their reasoning processes based on task complexity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying the cooperative behavior of autonomous AI agents is increasingly relevant.

Method: We devised a virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game to simulate internal team dynamics and external competition.

Result: The blend of internal team dynamics and external competition substantially boosts both overall and initial cooperation levels.

Conclusion: Intergroup competition can lead to more cooperative behavior, which is crucial for designing future multi-agent AI systems.

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

### [124] [Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652)
*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过分析策略分布来推断MARL系统中智能体的行为贡献，无需价值反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了可靠地部署多智能体强化学习（MARL）系统，理解团队中各个智能体的行为至关重要。以往的工作通常基于显式奖励信号或学习的价值函数来评估整体团队表现，但尚不清楚在没有任何价值反馈的情况下如何推断智能体的贡献。

Method: 提出了Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs)方法，该方法基于信息论的Shapley值，用于量化每个智能体对其合作者的工具性授权的因果影响。

Result: 通过在合作和竞争性MARL环境中进行分析，揭示了智能体采取相似或不同策略的程度。通过比较策略和价值函数之间的行动效果，该方法可以识别哪些智能体行为有益于团队成功，无论是通过促进确定性决策还是通过保持未来行动选择的灵活性。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解MARL系统中智能体的行为提供了新的见解，并增强了系统的可解释性。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

TL;DR: 本文认为，对欧盟AI法案的技术哲学解读可以深入了解AI系统中数据的长期动态，特别是从摄取到部署的生命周期如何生成递归价值链，从而挑战现有的负责任AI框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的负责任AI框架无法应对AI系统中数据从摄取到部署的生命周期所产生的递归价值链带来的挑战。

Method: 跨学科方法，对监管盲点进行技术上扎实且哲学上连贯的分析。通过西蒙多尼安技术哲学，改造他的个体化概念来建模AI生命周期。

Result: 引入了一个概念工具来构建AI pipeline，包括数据、训练机制、架构、特征存储和迁移学习。提出了futurity概念，即AI的自我强化生命周期，更多的数据增强性能，加深个性化，并扩大应用领域。

Conclusion: 有效监管必须解决这些基础设施和时间动态，并提出措施，包括生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈责任、递归透明度以及质疑递归重用的权利。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

Abstract: We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine
reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be

Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study
(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of
cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human
participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our
second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a
novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the
Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we
show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans
on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of
hierarchical tasks. The library is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this gap

Method: comprehensive methodology for measuring the energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power, host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.

Result: the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24 Wh of energy. Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of water (0.26 mL).

Conclusion: A comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for accurately comparing models and to properly incentivize efficiency gains across the full AI serving stack.

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

*Emma Rath,Stuart Armstrong,Rebecca Gorman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that evaluates conversations for parasocial cues in real time to prevent the negative effects of parasocial relationships with AI agents. A synthetic dataset test shows the framework can successfully identify parasocial conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently harmful.

Method: Introducing a response evaluation framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. Constructed a small synthetic dataset of thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations. Iterative evaluation with five stage testing.

Result: Identified all parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few exchanges.

Conclusion: Evaluation agents can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

TL;DR: LGT 是一种使用大型语言模型通过自然语言推理来优化机器学习配置的新框架，它优于传统方法，同时保持了高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 配置优化仍然是机器学习中的一个关键瓶颈，需要在模型架构、训练策略、特征工程和超参数之间进行协调调整。传统方法独立处理这些维度，缺乏可解释性，而最近的自动化方法难以适应动态性和对优化决策进行语义推理。

Method: LGT 采用多智能体大型语言模型，通过自然语言推理智能地优化配置。LGT 协调三个专门的智能体：提出配置更改的 Advisor、评估进度的 Evaluator 和改进决策过程的 Optimizer，从而创建一个自我改进的反馈循环。

Result: LGT 证明了与传统优化方法相比的实质性改进，在保持高可解释性的同时实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: LGT在六个不同的数据集上进行了全面的评估，与传统的优化方法相比，LGT 取得了显著的改进，在保持高可解释性的同时实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的数据结构，用于高效计算空间范围连接的随机样本，并在时间和空间效率上优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间范围连接在许多应用中都有应用，但计算成本高，结果集太大。返回连接结果的随机样本是一种缓解这些问题的实用方法，但有效计算随机样本并非易事。

Method: 提出了一种新的数据结构来解决空间范围连接的随机抽样问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该算法在大多数测试中明显快于基线算法。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在时间和空间效率上优于现有技术。

Abstract: Spatial range joins have many applications, including geographic information
systems, location-based social networking services, neuroscience, and
visualization. However, joins incur not only expensive computational costs but
also too large result sets. A practical and reasonable approach to alleviating
these issues is to return random samples of the join results. Although this is
promising and sufficient for many applications involving spatial range joins,
efficiently computing random samples is not trivial. This is because we must
obtain random join samples without running spatial range joins. We address this
challenging problem for the first time and aim at designing a time- and
space-efficient algorithm. First, we design two baseline algorithms that employ
existing techniques for random sampling and show that they are not efficient.
Then, we propose a new data structure that can deal with our problem in
$\tilde{O}(n + m + t)$ expected time and $O(n+m)$ space, where $n$ and $m$ are
the sizes of two point sets and $t$ is the required number of samples. We
conduct extensive experiments using four real spatial datasets, and the results
demonstrate that our algorithm is significantly faster than the baselines in
most tests.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CoreT的新算法，用于解决时间k核查询问题，该算法通过动态记录顶点或边进入k核的最早时间戳来实现剪枝，实验表明该算法比现有算法快四个数量级。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间图中查询有凝聚力的子图对于理解现实世界网络的动态结构至关重要，例如社交平台中不断发展的社区、Web上不断变化的超链接结构以及呼叫网络中瞬时的通信模式。

Method: 本文重新审视了时间k核查询问题，并引入了一种新的算法CoreT，该算法动态地记录每个顶点或边进入k核的最早时间戳。

Result: CoreT只需要对查询区间进行一次遍历，并实现了改进的时间复杂度，该复杂度在查询区间内的时间边数和区间的持续时间内都是线性的，使其对于长期时间分析具有高度的可扩展性。

Conclusion: CoreT算法在大型真实数据集上的实验结果表明，与现有的最先进的OTCD相比，CoreT实现了高达四个数量级的加速，证明了其在时间k核分析中的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Querying cohesive subgraphs in temporal graphs is essential for understanding
the dynamic structure of real-world networks, such as evolving communities in
social platforms, shifting hyperlink structures on the Web, and transient
communication patterns in call networks. Recently, research has focused on the
temporal $k$-core query, which aims to identify all $k$-cores across all
possible time sub-intervals within a given query interval. The state-of-the-art
algorithm OTCD mitigates redundant computations over overlapping sub-intervals
by exploiting inclusion relationships among $k$-cores in different time
intervals. Nevertheless, OTCD remains limited in scalability due to the
combinatorial growth in interval enumeration and repeated processing. In this
paper, we revisit the temporal $k$-core query problem and introduce a novel
algorithm CoreT, which dynamically records the earliest timestamp at which each
vertex or edge enters a $k$-core. This strategy enables substantial pruning of
redundant computations. As a result, CoreT requires only a single pass over the
query interval and achieves improved time complexity, which is linear in both
the number of temporal edges within the query interval and the duration of the
interval, making it highly scalable for long-term temporal analysis.
Experimental results on large real-world datasets show that CoreT achieves up
to four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the existing state-of-the-art
OTCD, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for temporal $k$-core
analysis.

Conclusion: AmbiSQL achieves 87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by 50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL

ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous

Motivation: improve the query performance when the edge resources reach a bottleneck. To achieve seamless switching of query execution between the cloud and edge

Method: propose a CQ processing method by establishing a CED collaborative framework based on the collaborative scan operator

Conclusion: The CED collaborative scan operator can effectively alleviate the performance degradation of scan operators caused by high I/O load and CPU wait time at the edge, and achieves balanced resource scheduling between the cloud and edge.

Abstract: In cloud-edge-device (CED) collaborative query (CQ) processing, by leveraging
CED collaboration, the advantages of both cloud computing and edge resources
can be fully integrated. However, it is difficult to implement collaborative
operators that can flexibly switch between the cloud and the edge during query
execution. Thus, in this paper, we aim to improve the query performance when
the edge resources reach a bottleneck. To achieve seamless switching of query
execution between the cloud and edge, we propose a CQ processing method by
establishing a CED collaborative framework based on the collaborative scan
operator, so that query execution can be transferred to the cloud at any time
when the edge resources are saturated. Extensive experiments show that, under
sufficient network download bandwidth, the CED collaborative scan operator can
effectively alleviate the performance degradation of scan operators caused by
high I/O load and CPU wait time at the edge. It also achieves balanced resource
scheduling between the cloud and edge.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Gorgeous improves vector search on SSDs by prioritizing graph structure over vectors, leading to higher throughput and lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Similarity-based vector search underpins many important applications, but a key challenge is processing massive vector datasets (e.g., in TBs). To reduce costs, some systems utilize SSDs as the primary data storage. They employ a proximity graph, which connects similar vectors to form a graph and is the state-of-the-art index for vector search. However, these systems are hindered by sub-optimal data layouts that fail to effectively utilize valuable memory space to reduce disk access and suffer from poor locality for accessing disk-resident data. Through extensive profiling and analysis, we found that the structure of the proximity graph index is accessed more frequently than the vectors themselves, yet existing systems do not distinguish between the two.

Method: design the Gorgeous system with the principle of prioritizing graph structure over vectors. Specifically, Gorgeous features a memory cache that keeps the adjacency lists of graph nodes to improve cache hits and a disk block format that explicitly stores neighbors' adjacency lists along with a vector to enhance data locality.

Result: Gorgeous consistently outperforms two state-of-the-art disk-based systems for vector search, boosting average query throughput by over 60% and reducing query latency by over 35%.

Conclusion: Gorgeous consistently outperforms two state-of-the-art disk-based systems for vector search, boosting average query throughput by over 60% and reducing query latency by over 35%.

*Yijie Zhou,Shengyuan Lin,Shufeng Gong,Song Yu,Shuhao Fan,Yanfeng Zhang,Ge Yu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: GoVector is an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for disk-based graph indices, it reduces I/O operations by 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query latency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based high-dimensional vector indices have become a mainstream solution for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). However, their substantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where frequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the dominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90% of query latency. Existing static caching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase

Method: GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores entry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that adaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search phase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns, GoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the same or adjacent pages

Result: At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations by 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query latency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.

Conclusion: GoVector achieves substantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations by 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query latency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.

substantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where
frequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the
dominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\% of query latency. Existing static
caching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by
preloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second
phase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high
recall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for
disk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores
entry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that
adaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search

GoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the

Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves
substantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations
by 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query

Motivation: 针对小众和动态社区的推荐系统面临来自数据稀疏、冷启动用户和物品以及隐私约束的持续挑战。传统的协同过滤和基于内容的方法在这些设置中表现不佳，要么需要侵入性的用户数据，要么在没有偏好历史记录时失效。

Result: DeepNaniNet在CiteULike基准测试中取得了最先进的冷启动结果，在用户召回方面与DropoutNet相匹配，且未降低矩阵外用户的性能，并且在AnimeULike暖启动中，在Recall@100上分别比加权矩阵分解（WMF）和DropoutNet高出7倍和1.5倍。

Conclusion: DeepNaniNet在数据稀疏和冷启动环境中提供高质量、保护隐私的推荐，同时有效整合异构内容源。

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural
recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive
graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations,
and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"
user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen
users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted
Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x
and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet
delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold
start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content
sources.

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous
QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This
research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing
with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable
performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model
can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady
performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in
recommendation systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces COSETTE and MARIUS to improve generative recommender systems by addressing the lack of collaborative signal and inefficiencies in existing methods. The proposed approach closes the performance gap with ID-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: identify two key limitations holding back generative approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture

Method: introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method and propose MARIUS, a lightweight, audio-inspired generative model

Result: Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between generative and modern ID-based models

Conclusion: The proposed approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the generative paradigm.

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster
further research.

### [141] [Personalized Recommendations via Active Utility-based Pairwise Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14911)
*Bahar Boroomand,James R. Wright*

TL;DR: A generalized utility-based framework learns preferences from pairwise comparisons with a utility-based active sampling strategy. It demonstrates improved accuracy and data efficiency in movie recommendation and university admissions tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully ranked lists of items, but ratings frequently fail to capture true preferences, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical.

Method: a generalized utility-based framework that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. A novel utility-based active sampling strategy for preference elicitation is used. The preference model is grounded in the probabilistic Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. Two implementations are presented: matrix factorization for movie recommendation and a neural network for university admissions.

Result: The framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm for personalized ranking.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm for personalized ranking.

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的依赖于单模态特征或将多模态特征视为补充的方法难以将用户的动态偏好与作者的多模态属性对齐，从而限制了准确性和可解释性。

Method: MSPA (多模态自校正偏好对齐)，一个个性化的作者推荐框架，包含两个组成部分：(1)一个多模态偏好组合器，它使用MLLM从用户的打赏历史中生成结构化的偏好文本和嵌入；(2)一个自校正偏好对齐推荐器，它将这些偏好与作者的多模态特征对齐，以提高准确性和可解释性。

Result: MSPA显著提高了准确率、召回率和文本质量，优于动态直播场景中的基线。

Conclusion: MSPA显著提高了准确率、召回率和文本质量，优于动态直播场景中的基线。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of live streaming platforms, personalized
recommendation systems have become pivotal in improving user experience and
driving platform revenue. The dynamic and multimodal nature of live streaming
content (e.g., visual, audio, textual data) requires joint modeling of user
behavior and multimodal features to capture evolving author characteristics.
However, traditional methods relying on single-modal features or treating
multimodal ones as supplementary struggle to align users' dynamic preferences
with authors' multimodal attributes, limiting accuracy and interpretability. To
address this, we propose MSPA (Multimodal Self-Corrective Preference
Alignment), a personalized author recommendation framework with two components:
(1) a Multimodal Preference Composer that uses MLLMs to generate structured
preference text and embeddings from users' tipping history; and (2) a
Self-Corrective Preference Alignment Recommender that aligns these preferences
with authors' multimodal features to improve accuracy and interpretability.
Extensive experiments and visualizations show that MSPA significantly improves
accuracy, recall, and text quality, outperforming baselines in dynamic live
streaming scenarios.

Motivation: 传统的推荐方法在冷启动和稀疏数据场景中仍然难以处理。现有的解决方案要么生成伪交互序列（通常引入冗余或噪声信号），要么严重依赖语义相似性，忽略了用户动机的动态变化。

Method: 提出了一种新的推荐框架，称为M-LLM3REC，它利用大型语言模型从有限的用户交互中进行深度动机信号提取。M-LLM3REC包括三个集成模块：面向动机的配置文件提取器（MOPE）、面向动机的特征编码器（MOTE）和动机对齐推荐器（MAR）。

Result: M-LLM3REC在冷启动情况下提高了性能。

Conclusion: M-LLM3REC通过强调动机驱动的语义建模，展示了鲁棒、个性化和可推广的推荐，特别是在冷启动情况下提高了性能。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and
platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting
decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering,
collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in
recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are
still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate
pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals,
or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user
motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language
models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions.
M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented
Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and
Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven
semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and
generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start
situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

TL;DR: CAU是一个用于session-based recommendation的课程近似unlearning框架，它通过多目标优化和课程学习来解决unlearning中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于会话的推荐中应用梯度上升（GA）进行近似unlearning面临双重挑战：直接应用GA可能导致推荐性能下降；现有研究未能考虑同时处理多个unlearning请求时unlearning样本的顺序，导致次优的推荐性能和unlearning效果。

Method: CAU框架，包含一个梯度上升（GA）项用于unlearning样本，并结合了保留项以保持性能。采用基于课程的序列来对批量的unlearning样本进行unlearning，并提出了两种策略（hard-sampling和soft-sampling）来根据难度分数选择unlearning样本。

Result: CAU框架在session-based recommendation中实现了有效的unlearning，同时保持了较好的推荐性能。

Conclusion: CAU通过寻找Pareto最优解来解决多目标优化问题，从而实现有效的unlearning，并在推荐性能上做出微小的牺牲。为了解决第二个挑战，CAU采用基于课程的序列来对批量的unlearning样本进行unlearning。关键的动机是从简单的样本到更难的样本执行unlearning。

Abstract: Approximate unlearning for session-based recommendation refers to eliminating
the influence of specific training samples from the recommender without
retraining of (sub-)models. Gradient ascent (GA) is a representative method to
conduct approximate unlearning. However, there still exist dual challenges to
apply GA for session-based recommendation. On the one hand, naive applying of
GA could lead to degradation of recommendation performance. On the other hand,
existing studies fail to consider the ordering of unlearning samples when
simultaneously processing multiple unlearning requests, leading to sub-optimal
recommendation performance and unlearning effect. To address the above
challenges, we introduce CAU, a curriculum approximate unlearning framework
tailored to session-based recommendation. CAU handles the unlearning task with
a GA term on unlearning samples. Specifically, to address the first challenge,
CAU formulates the overall optimization task as a multi-objective optimization
problem, where the GA term for unlearning samples is combined with retaining
terms for preserving performance. The multi-objective optimization problem is
solved through seeking the Pareto-Optimal solution, which achieves effective
unlearning with trivial sacrifice on recommendation performance. To tackle the
second challenge, CAU adopts a curriculum-based sequence to conduct unlearning
on batches of unlearning samples. The key motivation is to perform unlearning
from easy samples to harder ones. To this end, CAU first introduces two metrics
to measure the unlearning difficulty, including gradient unlearning difficulty
and embedding unlearning difficulty. Then, two strategies, hard-sampling and
soft-sampling, are proposed to select unlearning samples according to
difficulty scores.

TL;DR: MMQ通过统一多模态协同、特异性和行为适应性，为生成式检索和判别式排序任务提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案。它使用了一个新颖的多模态分词器，该分词器具有用于捕获多模态信息的共享-特定专家，并通过行为感知微调进行调整以适应下游推荐目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的推荐系统使用独特的标识符（ItemIDs）来表示项目，但这种方法难以处理大型、动态的项目语料库和稀疏的长尾数据，从而限制了可扩展性和泛化。语义ID从文本和图像等多模态内容中派生而来，通过将项目映射到共享语义空间，提供了一种有希望的替代方案，从而实现了知识转移并改进了对新项目或稀有项目的推荐。

Method: 我们提出了多模态混合量化（MMQ），这是一个训练新型多模态分词器的两阶段框架。首先，共享-特定分词器利用具有模态特定和模态共享专家的多专家架构，使用正交正则化来捕获全面的多模态信息。其次，行为感知微调动态地将语义ID调整到下游推荐目标，同时通过多模态重建损失保留模态信息。

Result: 大量的离线实验和在线A/B测试表明，

Conclusion: MMQ有效地统一了多模态协同、特异性和行为适应性，为生成式检索和判别式排序任务提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然神经排序模型 (NRM) 已显示出很高的有效性，但它们仍然容易受到对抗性操纵。

Method: Few-Shot Adversarial Prompting (FSAP)，这是一种新颖的黑盒攻击框架，它利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 的上下文学习能力来生成高排名的对抗性文档。通过在少量先前观察到的有害示例的支持集上调节 LLM，FSAP 合成语法流畅且主题连贯的文档，这些文档巧妙地嵌入虚假或误导性信息，并且在排名上与真实内容竞争。

Result: 在 TREC 2020 和 2021 Health Misinformation Tracks 上的实验，使用四种不同的神经排序模型，表明 FSAP 生成的文档始终优于可信的、事实准确的文档。我们的分析表明，这些对抗性输出表现出强大的立场一致性和低可检测性。

Conclusion: FSAP生成的对抗性文档始终优于可信的、事实准确的文档。这些对抗性输出表现出强大的立场一致性和低可检测性，对神经检索系统构成了现实且可扩展的威胁。FSAP还可以有效地推广到专有和开源的LLM。

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: MLLMRec achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 38.53% over the best baselines.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation typically combines the user behavioral data with
the modal features of items to reveal user's preference, presenting superior
performance compared to the conventional recommendations. However, existing
methods still suffer from two key problems: (1) the initialization methods of
user multimodal representations are either behavior-unperceived or
noise-contaminated, and (2) the KNN-based item-item graph contains noisy edges
with low similarities and lacks audience co-occurrence relationships. To
address such issues, we propose MLLMRec, a novel MLLM-driven multimodal
recommendation framework with two item-item graph refinement strategies. On the
one hand, the item images are first converted into high-quality semantic
descriptions using an MLLM, which are then fused with the textual metadata of
items. Then, we construct a behavioral description list for each user and feed
it into the MLLM to reason about the purified user preference containing
interaction motivations. On the other hand, we design the threshold-controlled
denoising and topology-aware enhancement strategies to refine the suboptimal
item-item graph, thereby enhancing the item representation learning. Extensive
experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that MLLMRec
achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 38.53%
over the best baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的序列推荐方法常常受到信息交互不足的困扰，而最近的生成推荐模型通过直接生成项目预测在一定程度上解决了这个问题。为了更好地捕捉用户意图，最近的研究将推理过程引入到生成推荐中，显著提高了推荐性能。然而，这些方法受到项目语义表示的奇异性的限制，面临着推理路径多样性有限和推理过程可靠性不足等挑战。

Method: REG4Rec构建多个动态语义推理路径以及自反思过程，确保高置信度的推荐。它利用基于MoE的并行量化码本 (MPQ) 为每个项目生成多个无序语义token，从而构建更大规模的多样化推理空间。此外，通过Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) 和 Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) 策略增强推理的可靠性。在推理过程中，提出了一种面向一致性的自反思剪枝 (CORP) 方法来丢弃不一致的推理路径。

Result: REG4Rec提供了出色的性能和巨大的实际价值。

Conclusion: REG4Rec在真实世界数据集和在线评估中表现出色，具有巨大的实际价值。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next action in large-scale
recommender systems. While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient
information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially
address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture
user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into
generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance.
However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic
representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning
pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these
issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that
constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a
self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations.
Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook
(MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby
constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance
the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement
stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a
Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions
tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA
introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During
inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed
to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of
erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy
for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online
evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial
practical value.

Recent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models.
However, current two-stage models often filter out significant information,
resulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the
complete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and
generative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest
Network) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user
interest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest
extraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain
interest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between
interest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user
interests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and
interest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented
interest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with
the latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted
interest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the
generated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive
offline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial
dataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN.
Moreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B
testing. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes SUAN and LightSUAN to improve CTR prediction. LightSUAN is distilled from SUAN and integrated into an online service, increasing the CTR by 2.81% and CPM by 1.69%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: current CTR models generally encounter bottlenecks in performance improvement. Inspired by the scaling law phenomenon of LLMs, we propose a new paradigm for improving CTR predictions: first, constructing a CTR model with accuracy scalable to the model grade and data size, and then distilling the knowledge implied in this model into its lightweight model that can serve online users

Method: constructing a CTR model named SUAN (Stacked Unified Attention Network) and modify the SUAN with sparse self-attention and parallel inference strategies to form LightSUAN, and then adopt online distillation to train the low-grade LightSUAN, taking a high-grade SUAN as a teacher

Result: SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning three orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled LightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher

Conclusion: The distilled LightSUAN has been integrated into an online service, increasing the CTR by 2.81% and CPM by 1.69% while keeping the average inference time acceptable.

Abstract: CTR models play a vital role in improving user experience and boosting
business revenue in many online personalized services. However, current CTR
models generally encounter bottlenecks in performance improvement. Inspired by
the scaling law phenomenon of LLMs, we propose a new paradigm for improving CTR
predictions: first, constructing a CTR model with accuracy scalable to the
model grade and data size, and then distilling the knowledge implied in this
model into its lightweight model that can serve online users. To put it into
practice, we construct a CTR model named SUAN (Stacked Unified Attention
Network). In SUAN, we propose the UAB as a behavior sequence encoder. A single
UAB unifies the modeling of the sequential and non-sequential features and also
measures the importance of each user behavior feature from multiple
perspectives. Stacked UABs elevate the configuration to a high grade, paving
the way for performance improvement. In order to benefit from the high
performance of the high-grade SUAN and avoid the disadvantage of its long
inference time, we modify the SUAN with sparse self-attention and parallel
inference strategies to form LightSUAN, and then adopt online distillation to
train the low-grade LightSUAN, taking a high-grade SUAN as a teacher. The
distilled LightSUAN has superior performance but the same inference time as the
LightSUAN, making it well-suited for online deployment. Experimental results
show that SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning
three orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled
LightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher. More
importantly, the distilled LightSUAN has been integrated into an online
service, increasing the CTR by 2.81% and CPM by 1.69% while keeping the average
inference time acceptable. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: TrackRec, a framework designed to enhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs for RS, improves user preference analysis and validation capacity through iterative alternating feedback learning between a RecCoT generator and a RecCoT validator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often suffer from hallucination issues, there is no guarantee that their reasoning CoT is effective. A key challenge is to further enhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs through effective CoT reasonings.

Method: TrackRec consists of a RecCoT generator (G) and a RecCoT validator (V). Furthermore, we design alternating feedback learning mechanism that G undergoes direct preference optimization via feedback from V to produce increasingly accurate RecCoT aligned with V's standards. Meanwhile, V is fine-tuned using the inference feedback from G to enhance its validation capabilities in alignment with recommendation tasks. Through iterative alternating feedback learning between G and V

Result: TrackRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods and achieves substantial gains on a large advertising platform with hundreds of millions of users.

Conclusion: TrackRec continuously improves the user preference analysis capability of G and the validation capacity of V. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, TrackRec has been deployed on a lagre advertising platform with hundreds of millions of users, achieving substantial gains.

Abstract: The extensive world knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recommendation
systems (RS). Specifically, The chain of thought (CoT) has been shown to
improve the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks for RS. However, due
to the fact that LLMs often suffer from hallucination issues, there is no
guarantee that their reasoning CoT is effective. A key challenge is to further
enhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs through effective CoT
reasonings. Therefore, we propose \textbf{TrackRec}, a framework designed to
enhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs for RS. TrackRec specifically focuses on
accurately inferring recommendation CoT \textbf{(RecCoT)} for user preference
using the knowledge from LLMs. This RecCoT can serve both as an explanation for
the LLM's completion of recommendation tasks and as auxiliary features to
assist recommendation models in accomplishing recommendation tasks. TrackRec
consists of a RecCoT generator $(G)$ and a RecCoT validator $(V)$. Furthermore,
we design alternating feedback learning mechanism that $G$ undergoes direct
preference optimization via feedback from $V$ to produce increasingly accurate
RecCoT aligned with $V$'s standards. Meanwhile, $V$ is fine-tuned using the
inference feedback from $G$ to enhance its validation capabilities in alignment
with recommendation tasks. Through iterative alternating feedback learning
between $G$ and $V$, TrackRec continuously improves the user preference
analysis capability of $G$ and the validation capacity of $V$. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it
surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, TrackRec has been deployed on a
lagre advertising platform with hundreds of millions of users, achieving
substantial gains.

Motivation: 现有的RAG pipeline通常将检索和推理视为孤立的组件，限制了在需要迭代证据收集或高精度检索的复杂任务上的性能。

Method: 对结合反馈的先进检索和排序机制进行了结构化的概述，并根据反馈信号的来源和作用对其进行分类，以改进查询、检索到的上下文或文档池。

Result: 提出了一个关于先进的检索和排序机制的结构化概述，这些机制集成了反馈。

Conclusion: 这篇综述旨在弥合信息检索（IR）和自然语言处理（NLP）的视角，并强调检索作为端到端RAG系统中一个动态的、可学习的组成部分。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies have not systematically investigated the impact of visual adversarial attacks on MEL models.

Method: We propose an LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking (LLM-RetLink).

Result: current MEL models generally lack sufficient robustness against visual perturbations. LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by 0.4%-35.7%, especially showing significant advantages under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: We propose an LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking (LLM-RetLink), which significantly improves the model's anti-interference ability through a two-stage process. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by 0.4%-35.7%, especially showing significant advantages under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: The explosive growth of multimodal data has driven the rapid development of
multimodal entity linking (MEL) models. However, existing studies have not
systematically investigated the impact of visual adversarial attacks on MEL
models. We conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of
mainstream MEL models under different adversarial attack scenarios, covering
two core tasks: Image-to-Text (I2T) and Image+Text-to-Text (IT2T). Experimental
results show that current MEL models generally lack sufficient robustness
against visual perturbations. Interestingly, contextual semantic information in
input can partially mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations. Based on
this insight, we propose an LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking
(LLM-RetLink), which significantly improves the model's anti-interference
ability through a two-stage process: first, extracting initial entity
descriptions using large vision models (LVMs), and then dynamically generating
candidate descriptive sentences via web-based retrieval. Experiments on five
datasets demonstrate that LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by
0.4%-35.7%, especially showing significant advantages under adversarial
conditions. This research highlights a previously unexplored facet of MEL
robustness, constructs and releases the first MEL adversarial example dataset,
and sets the stage for future work aimed at strengthening the resilience of
multimodal systems in adversarial environments.

  Our findings show that thematic bias originates from content imbalances and

Motivation: 自动驾驶汽车在减少交通事故死亡人数和提高运输效率方面具有广阔前景，但它们的广泛采用取决于将强大的道德推理嵌入到日常和紧急操作中。

Conclusion: 结合形式控制理论和数据驱动学习，从而在复杂的人机混合交通环境中推进具有道德责任的自主性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

Motivation: 由于患者群体和临床环境的巨大差异，准确的肺癌风险预测仍然具有挑战性，没有一个单一模型对所有队列都表现最佳。

Result: 该智能体通过结合队列特异性知识与现代检索和推理技术，动态地为每位患者选择最合适的模型，从而实现个性化的肺癌风险预测。

Conclusion: 该智能体支持跨不同临床人群的灵活且由队列驱动的模型选择，为现实世界肺癌筛查中的个体化风险评估提供了一条切实可行的途径。

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The NAS model used in text classification does not have a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse.

Method: The paper proposes HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive Mutation Policies), which employs mutation strategies that dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using Q-learning.

Result: The proposed model achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines on the Spider dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed HHNAS-AM model consistently discovers high-performing architectures and achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy on the Spider dataset.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

Motivation: DPO（直接偏好优化）由于其简单性和训练稳定性而成为一种广泛使用的离线偏好优化算法，但是，DPO容易过度拟合和崩溃。

Method: 用绝对差分损失代替log-sigmoid函数实现梯度解耦；通过偏移约束和正则化项来提高稳定性；使用梯度分离和可调系数来实现可控的拒绝抑制。

Conclusion: LPO在各种任务（包括通用文本任务、数学任务和文本到语音（TTS）任务）上持续提高性能，是一个稳健且可调整的偏好对齐范例。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

TL;DR: LFM4Ads improves ads recommendation by comprehensively transferring user, item, and cross representations from large foundation models, resulting in significant revenue increases for Tencent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in online advertising have limitations in transferring user, item, and cross representations from large-scale foundation models.

Method: LFM4Ads, an All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework

Result: LFM4Ads achieved a 2.45% overall GMV lift across Tencent's advertising platform, leading to estimated annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Conclusion: LFM4Ads has achieved significant GMV lift and revenue increases since its deployment in Tencent's advertising platform.

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Motivation: 来自多普勒激光雷达、雷达和辐射计等遥感仪器的精确大气廓线经常被低信噪比门、量程折叠和虚假不连续性破坏。传统的间隙填充会模糊精细结构，而深度模型缺乏置信度估计。

Method: 该论文提出了一种课程引导的蒙特卡洛随机集成掩码自动编码器（CuMoLoS-MAE）。

Result: CuMoLoS-MAE 能够（i）恢复精细尺度的特征，如上升和下降气流核心、剪切线和小涡旋，（ii）学习大气场的data-driven先验，以及（iii）量化像素级的uncertainty。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的基于深度学习的工作流程，可以实现高保真重建，从而增强对流诊断，支持实时数据同化，并改进长期气候再分析。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Conclusion: Aura-CAPTCHA is robust and scalable for securing online applications while remaining accessible to users.

Abstract: Aura-CAPTCHA was developed as a multi-modal CAPTCHA system to address
vulnerabilities in traditional methods that are increasingly bypassed by AI
technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and adversarial image
processing. The design integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
generating dynamic image challenges, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive
difficulty tuning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for creating text and audio
prompts. Visual challenges included 3x3 grid selections with at least three
correct images, while audio challenges combined randomized numbers and words
into a single task. RL adjusted difficulty based on incorrect attempts,
response time, and suspicious user behavior. Evaluations on real-world traffic
demonstrated a 92% human success rate and a 10% bot bypass rate, significantly
outperforming existing CAPTCHA systems. The system provided a robust and
scalable approach for securing online applications while remaining accessible
to users, addressing gaps highlighted in previous research.

Conclusion: GEO 可以一致地逼近相应解，并且 rank、depth 和 width 仅以逼近误差的倒数的对数形式增长。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

<details>

Motivation: 在分布式加速器系统上划分大型机器学习模型是一个复杂的过程，需要一系列相互依赖的决策，这些决策因内部分片歧义而进一步复杂化。因此，现有的自动分区器经常遇到内存不足的错误，或者在探索可能的分区的大量空间时速度慢得令人望而却步。为了缓解这种情况，他们人为地限制了搜索空间，但这种方法经常产生违反设备内存约束或导致次优性能的不可行解决方案。

Method: 该系统结合了一种新颖的静态编译器分析与蒙特卡洛树搜索。

Result: 该系统优于最先进的工业方法。

Conclusion: 该系统在各种硬件平台和模型架构上显著优于最先进的工业方法，发现了以前未知的、更优越的解决方案，并且即使对于复杂的大型模型，该过程也是完全自动化的。

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在通过利用分子图中编码的丰富结构信息来预测分子性质方面取得了显著成功。然而，它们的黑盒性质降低了解释性，这限制了对药物发现和材料设计等重要应用中预测的信任。此外，由于纠缠的消息传递动态，现有的解释技术通常无法可靠地量化单个原子或子结构的贡献。

Conclusion: SEAL在定量归因指标和人为对齐的可解释性方面优于其他可解释性方法，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了一个有希望的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of confidence, which is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes where models can easily overfit. Naively applying bootstrapping to deep learning is impractical.

Method: A resampling-based training procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin.

Result: Twin-Boot provides regularization that favors flatter solutions and improves calibration and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Conclusion: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot) improves calibration, generalization, and yields interpretable uncertainty maps in deep neural networks and complex high-dimensional inverse problems.

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Conclusion: 联邦学习始终能提高任何单个客户端的收敛速度，因为参与客户端的数量增加了。

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational costs of training deep neural networks have significantly increased, and traditional layer-freezing methods have limitations in reducing computation costs due to the need for forward propagation in frozen layers. Overlooked challenges in caching feature maps, such as applying augmentations and substantial storage overhead, impact performance and feasibility.

Method: The paper proposes similarity-aware channel augmentation and progressive compression strategy.

Result: The proposed solution achieves significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with a minor time overhead.

Conclusion: This paper introduces similarity-aware channel augmentation and progressive compression to improve training accuracy and reduce storage overhead in layer-freezing techniques. The solution achieves significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with a minor time overhead. The paper also provides insights into optimizing freezing and compression strategies for efficient DNN training through comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates with tight minimax rates for mean estimation and linear regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring structural heterogeneity in distributed and federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks.

Method: Mean estimation for multivariate bounded distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, multivariate gaussian mean estimation and linear regression

Result: Tight minimax rates for heterogeneous corruption patterns in mean estimation; minimax rate for squared error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$ in multivariate gaussian mean estimation and linear regression.

Conclusion: The optimal estimators may discard samples beyond a certain corruption threshold, determined by the empirical distribution of the corruption rates.

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

TL;DR: This paper introduces NGN-M, a momentum-based optimizer with improved stability and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while being less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern optimizers are sensitive to hyperparameter choices, and tuning them is difficult. Recent efforts enhance stability across hyperparameter choices.

Method: The paper proposes a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method, resulting in the NGN-M optimizer.

Result: NGN-M attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less restrictive assumptions and demonstrates enhanced robustness to step-size hyperparameter choice, delivering comparable or superior performance to other optimizers.

Conclusion: The paper introduces NGN-M, a momentum-based optimizer, that matches state-of-the-art performance and improves stability to step-size hyperparameter choice.

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Conclusion: DNNs在过度参数化状态下会发生输出特征空间的崩溃，但可以通过wormhole solution避免简并。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for improving the interpretability of large language models by reducing polysemanticity.  SAEs show promise, but increased sparsity can hurt performance. The paper introduces a new intervention method, APP, for targeted concept removal that works effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting large language models is challenging due to polysemanticity, where neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed to mitigate this issue.

Method: The paper introduces a fine-grained concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance to evaluate monosemanticity. It also proposes Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention method.

Result: SAEs reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability, but greater sparsity doesn't always improve separability and can impair downstream performance. SAEs enable more precise concept-level control, and APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Conclusion: SAEs enable more precise concept-level control compared to base models, especially with partial suppression. The paper introduces APP, a new intervention method for targeted suppression that outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Motivation: 传统的CVR预测方法将模型训练限制为来自单个生产关键归因机制的标签，丢弃了替代归因视角中的补充信号。

Method: MAL是一个联合学习框架，由归因知识聚合器（AKA）和主要目标预测器（PTP）两个核心组件组成。此外，我们提出了一种新的训练策略CAT，它利用所有归因标签组合的笛卡尔积来生成丰富的监督信号。

Result: MAL优于单一归因学习基线。

Conclusion: MAL在离线指标上实现了+0.51%的GAUC改进，在线实验表明，MAL实现了+2.6%的ROI（投资回报率）增长。

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CETs can be easily circumvented and present several side effects of concept erasure. Side Effect Evaluation benchmark is proposed to quantify side effects of CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets, and attribute leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy, copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques (CETs). The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired ``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.

Method: Side Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes. automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets, and attribute leakage.

Result: CETs can be circumvented by using superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as compositional variants of the target. CETs suffer from attribute leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.

Conclusion: CETs can be circumvented, suffer from attribute leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra

*Xiangman Li,Xiaodong Wu,Qi Li,Jianbing Ni,Rongxing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeLLM 是一种基于 unlearning 的新型防御框架，它可以从 LLM 中unlearn有害知识，同时保持语言流畅性和通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak 攻击通过精心设计的对抗性提示来绕过对齐机制，导致模型生成有害、受限或有偏见的内容，从而对大型语言模型 (LLM) 的安全性构成严重威胁。

Method: SafeLLM 采用三阶段流程：(1) 采用混合方法（将外部分类器与模型内部评估相结合）进行动态不安全输出检测；(2) 通过前馈网络 (FFN) 激活进行令牌级有害内容追踪，以定位有害知识；(3) 约束优化，以抑制不安全行为，同时不降低整体模型质量。

Result: 在多个 jailbreak 基准测试中，对著名的 LLM（Vicuna、LLaMA 和 GPT-J）进行的大量实验表明，SafeLLM 大大降低了攻击成功率，同时保持了较高的通用性能。与监督微调和直接偏好优化等标准防御方法相比，SafeLLM 提供了更强的安全保证、对有害行为更精确的控制以及对未见攻击的更强鲁棒性。此外，SafeLLM 在有害知识unlearn后保持了一般的性能。

Conclusion: SafeLLM通过不可逆地中和负责有害生成途径的FFN子结构，实现了有针对性的、不可逆的遗忘。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

TL;DR: FairPrep是一个用于评估公平性预处理技术的基准测试框架，它填补了公平性基准测试领域的空白，并为数据层面的公平性研究奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统越来越多地集成到高风险的决策过程中，确保算法结果的公平性已成为一个关键问题。解决偏见的方法通常分为三类：预处理、处理中和后处理。虽然后两者受到了极大的关注，但预处理方法在数据层面进行操作，并具有模型无关性和改进的隐私合规性等优点，但受到的关注相对较少，并且缺乏标准化评估工具。

Conclusion: FairPrep填补了公平基准测试领域的关键空白，并为推进数据层面的公平性研究提供了实践基础。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Motivation: 张量神经网络在解决高维问题上表现出优越性。然而，与传统的神经网络类似，张量神经网络也受到频率原则的影响，这限制了它们准确捕获解决方案的高频特征的能力。

Method: 通过傅里叶分析分析了张量神经网络的训练动态，并通过结合随机傅里叶特征增强了其对高维多尺度问题的表达能力。此外，还提出了一种新的方法，通过对一维分量函数执行离散傅里叶变换来提取高维函数的频率特征。

Result: 所提出的频率自适应张量神经网络算法显著提高了张量神经网络在解决复杂多尺度问题中的能力。

Conclusion: 提出了一种频率自适应张量神经网络算法，并通过大量数值实验验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual sleep stage classification is time-consuming and prone to error. Existing machine/deep learning methods struggle with EEG/EOG non-stationarity and variability, leading to poor generalization.

Method: Developed Multivariate Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation learning, trained with cross-domain alignment.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on five sleep staging datasets. Ablation analyses and interpretation of differential attention weights were conducted.

Conclusion: The SleepDIFFormer method advances automated sleep stage classification and its application to sleep quality assessment.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for generating interpretations for black-box models that balances accuracy and explainability with local optimality guarantees, achieving comparable results to global methods with improved scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models involves balancing accuracy and explainability. Existing techniques lack formal guarantees on Pareto-optimality or face scalability limitations.

Method: A framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more scalable synthesis of interpretations.  It uses Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search and verifies local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem, which we solve using a SAT solver.

Result: The approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods offering global guarantees. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the Pareto-optimal front of interpretations.

Conclusion: The approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods offering global guarantees.

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces poly-window contrastive learning for ECG analysis, improving performance and efficiency compared to existing methods by leveraging the temporal structure of ECG recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for ECG analysis are often constrained by limited access to annotated data. Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG recordings and generate only pairwise augmented views.

Method: Poly-window contrastive learning framework: Extracts multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics, encouraging the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features.

Result: Poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring fewer pre-training epochs and less total wall clock pre-training time. Demonstrates robustness across various hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Poly-window contrastive learning is a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis and a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

TL;DR: CSG在知识图谱链接预测中不好用，试试关系熵等其他指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解数据集复杂性对于评估和比较知识图谱（KG）上的链接预测模型至关重要。先前的累积谱梯度（CSG）度量尚未在KG设置中进行评估。

Method: 通过transformer获得的嵌入，在多关系链接预测的环境中，批判性地检查CSG，并引入和评估了一组结构和语义KG复杂性指标。

Result: CSG对参数化高度敏感，不能稳健地随类别数量缩放，并且与标准性能指标（如平均倒数排名（MRR）和Hit@1）的相关性较弱或不一致。关系熵、节点级最大关系多样性和关系类型基数与MRR和Hit@1呈强烈的负相关，而图连通性度量（如平均度数、度数熵、PageRank和特征向量中心性）与Hit@10呈正相关。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测中效果不佳，需要更稳定、可解释和任务对齐的复杂性度量。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and

Conclusion: Partial logic effectively tackles challenges related to unknown classes, leading to consistent performance improvements in various tasks.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ExBigBang, a hybrid text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich contextual features for persona classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling user behaviour, but capturing contextual information, especially by integrating textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify.

Method: This paper presents ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification, the approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.

Result: ExBigBang, a hybrid text-tabular approach, models rich contextual features for persona classification. It incorporates metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification, this approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.

Conclusion: The experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the robustness of the ExBigBang model. The ablation study confirms the benefits of combining text and tabular data. Explainable AI techniques shed light on the rationale behind the model's predictions.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining

TL;DR: end-users can induce fairness through the framework of Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data, leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Recognizing that many models rely on user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training process.

Method: three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate ideal relabeling

Result: substantially reduce unfairness with a small impact on the overall prediction error.

Conclusion: A subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a small impact on the overall prediction error.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

TL;DR: EvoFormer通过结构感知Transformer模块和进化敏感时间模块来解决动态图嵌入中的结构访问偏差和突发演化盲视问题，并在多个任务上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态图级嵌入方法面临两个关键但未被充分探索的问题：结构访问偏差，即随机游走抽样不成比例地强调高次节点，导致冗余和噪声结构表示；以及突发演化盲视，即由于刚性或过于简单的时间建模策略，未能有效检测到突然的结构变化，导致不一致的时间嵌入。

Method: EvoFormer，一个为动态图级表示学习量身定制的进化感知Transformer框架，它引入了一个结构感知Transformer模块，该模块结合了基于节点结构角色的位置编码，以及一个进化敏感时间模块，该模块通过一个连续的三步策略显式地建模时间演化。

Result: EvoFormer在五个基准数据集上进行了广泛的评估，确认了其在图相似性排序、时间异常检测和时间分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EvoFormer在图相似性排序、时间异常检测和时间分割任务中实现了最先进的性能，验证了其在纠正结构和时间偏差方面的有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a clustering method that adapts dynamically and doesn't require pre-selection of the number of clusters, within the federated learning context.

Method: An evolving fuzzy system within federated learning, implemented using PyTorch.

Result: The method outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI datasets. It is computationally intensive due to overlap condition calculations.

Conclusion: The proposed evolving fuzzy system outperforms established classification methods on UCI datasets in decentralized data processing.

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

TL;DR: propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to accelerate DeepONet training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into two smaller, more manageable subproblems one for the branch network and one for the trunk network and solves them separately.

Method: an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method

Result: accelerate DeepONet training

Conclusion: The method is generalized to a broader type of  L2  loss with a regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

Motivation: 使用可穿戴设备的人类活动识别 (HAR) 近年来取得了显着进展，但当模型部署到新用户时，其泛化仍然受到限制。这种性能下降主要是由于用户引起的漂移 (UICD)，突出了有效个性化的重要性

Method: 提出了一种混合框架，该框架首先跨用户泛化，然后使用 few-shot learning 在设备上快速适应个体用户。通过仅使用用户特定数据更新分类器层，该方法以最小的计算和内存开销实现了强大的个性化

Result: 后部署适应分别产生了 3.73%、17.38% 和 3.70% 的持续准确性提高

Conclusion: 快速、轻量级且有效的个性化在嵌入式平台上是可行的，为实际应用中可扩展的且用户感知的 HAR 系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild
