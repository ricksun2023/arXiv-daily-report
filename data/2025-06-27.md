### [1] [Towards Probabilistic Question Answering Over Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20747)
*Chen Shen,Sajjadur Rahman,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a new benchmark and framework for probabilistic question answering over tabular data, achieving better results by combining Bayesian Networks and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data fall short on probabilistic questions requiring reasoning under uncertainty.

Method: The method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to generate final answers.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a new benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data, demonstrating significant improvements over baselines.

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [2] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 创建多语言功能基准来评估大型语言模型在多语言环境中的性能和鲁棒性，结果表明静态基准的有效性各不相同，且模型在不同语言上的鲁棒性差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态数据基准通常无法充分理解模型在多语言环境中的实际性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过将现有的功能基准模板从英语翻译成五种额外的语言（法语、西班牙语、印地语、阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语）来创建多语言功能基准——跨语言小学数学符号（CL-GSM 符号）和跨语言指令跟随评估（CL-IFEval）。

Result: 某些静态多语言基准比其他基准更密切地捕捉功能性能（即，在 M-GSM 和 CL-GSM 符号之间，英语、法语和西班牙语的性能分别下降 24%、17% 和 18%；同样，在 Belebele 和 CL-IFEval 之间，各语言的性能下降 15 - 24%，而在 M-MMLU 和 CL-IFEval 之间，性能仅下降 0.5% 至 3%）。

Conclusion: 模型在不同语言上的鲁棒性差异显著，某些语言（如阿拉伯语、英语）在评估迭代中表现最为稳定。

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

### [3] [The Ideation-Execution Gap: Execution Outcomes of LLM-Generated versus Human Research Ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20803)
*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）可以生成新颖的研究想法，但当这些想法被执行时，它们的结果不如人类专家产生的想法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 在加速科学研究流程方面显示出前景。这个过程的一个关键能力是产生新的研究想法的能力，并且先前的研究发现，在某些情况下，LLM 产生的研究想法被认为比人类专家的想法更具新颖性。然而，一个好的想法不应该只是看起来新颖，它还应该在执行后产生更好的研究成果。

Method: 通过招募 43 位专家研究人员来执行随机分配的想法（由专家撰写或由 LLM 生成）来进行执行研究。

Result: LLM 生成的想法的分数在所有评估指标（新颖性、兴奋度、有效性和整体性；p < 0.05）上的下降幅度明显大于专家撰写的想法，缩小了在构思阶段观察到的 LLM 和人类想法之间的差距。当比较执行研究的汇总审查分数时，我们甚至观察到，对于许多指标，排名发生了翻转，人类的想法得分高于 LLM 的想法。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型在产生真正有效的研究想法方面存在局限性，并且在缺乏执行结果的情况下评估研究想法是具有挑战性的。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

### [4] [MultiFinRAG: An Optimized Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework for Financial Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20821)
*Chinmay Gondhalekar,Urjitkumar Patel,Fang-Chun Yeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiFinRAG是一种专门为金融QA构建的RAG框架，它通过多模态提取、模态感知检索和分层回退策略，在复杂金融QA任务上优于ChatGPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于token限制、布局损失和分散的跨模态上下文，跨模态内容上的问答给传统的 LLM 和 RAG 管道带来了压力。

Method: MultiFinRAG首先执行多模态提取，将表格和图形图像分组为批次，并将它们发送到轻量级的量化开源多模态 LLM，从而生成结构化的 JSON 输出和简洁的文本摘要。这些输出与叙述性文本一起被嵌入和索引，并具有感知模态的相似性阈值，以便进行精确检索。然后，分层回退策略在必要时从纯文本上下文动态升级到文本+表格+图像上下文，从而在减少不相关上下文的同时实现跨模态推理。

Result: MultiFinRAG 的准确率比 ChatGPT-4o 高 19 个百分点。

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG在涉及文本、表格、图像和组合多模态推理的复杂金融 QA 任务上，比 ChatGPT-4o（免费层）的准确率高 19 个百分点，并且运行在通用硬件上。

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

### [5] [A Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework for E-commerce Query Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21049)
*Chunyuan Yuan,Chong Zhang,Zheng Fang,Ming Pang,Xue Jiang,Changping Peng,Zhangang Lin,Ching Law*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的半监督可扩展统一框架(SSUF)，包含多个增强模块来统一查询分类任务, 实验表明SSUF显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务查询通常很短且缺乏上下文，并且标签之间的信息无法使用，导致建模的先验信息不足。大多数现有的工业查询分类方法依赖于用户后验点击行为来构建训练样本，导致马太效应恶性循环。此外，查询分类的子任务缺乏统一的框架，导致算法优化效率低下。

Method: 提出了一种新的半监督可扩展统一框架(SSUF)，包含多个增强模块来统一查询分类任务。

Result: 离线和在线A/B实验表明，SSUF显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SSUF显著优于现有模型。

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

### [6] [Uncovering Hidden Violent Tendencies in LLMs: A Demographic Analysis via Behavioral Vignettes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20822)
*Quintin Myers,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究使用 Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ) 评估 LLM，发现 LLM 的暴力倾向因人口统计而异，并且与犯罪学、社会科学和心理学中的既定发现相矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 越来越多地被提议用于检测和响应在线暴力内容，但它们对道德上模棱两可的现实场景的推理能力仍未得到充分检验。

Method: 使用经过验证的社会科学工具 Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ) 评估 LLM，该工具旨在衡量人类对日常冲突的反应。引入了基于角色的提示，该提示在美国境内改变了种族、年龄和地理身份。

Result: (1) LLM 的表面文本生成通常与它们对暴力反应的内在偏好不同；(2) 它们的暴力倾向因人口统计而异，并且经常与犯罪学、社会科学和心理学中的既定发现相矛盾。

Conclusion: LLMs的暴力倾向因人口统计而异，并且与犯罪学、社会科学和心理学中的既定发现相矛盾。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

### [7] [Enhancing Automatic Term Extraction with Large Language Models via Syntactic Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21222)
*Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Dongjun Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a syntactic retrieval method to improve the performance of large language models in automatic term extraction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of large language models (LLMs) for automatic term extraction (ATE) has scarcely been examined.

Method: A retrieval-based prompting strategy that selects demonstrations according to syntactic similarity.

Result: Syntactic retrieval improves F1-score. Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks.

Conclusion: Syntactic retrieval improves F1-score in terminology-extraction tasks, highlighting the importance of syntactic cues when adapting LLMs.

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

### [8] [Decide less, communicate more: On the construct validity of end-to-end fact-checking in medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20876)
*Sebastian Joseph,Lily Chen,Barry Wei,Michael Mackert,Iain J. Marshall,Paul Pu Liang,Ramez Kouzy,Byron C. Wallace,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Clinical experts face challenges verifying real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence, suggesting fact-checking should be interactive, not end-to-end.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interest in adopting fact-checking systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and diverse medical literature. Problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end fact-checking agents

Method: a study examining how clinical experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence

Result: Difficulties connecting claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials; ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and inherently subjective veracity labels.

Conclusion: Fact-checking should be approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than an end-to-end process.

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

*Istabrak Abbes,Gabriele Prato,Quentin Fournier,Fernando Rodriguez,Alaa Boukhary,Adam Elwood,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs to reduce inference time and resource consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge. Groundedness is essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness.

Method: fine-tuned on curated datasets

Result: achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Lightweight, task specific encoder models can achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs in groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

### [10] [Optimising Language Models for Downstream Tasks: A Post-Training Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20917)
*Zhengyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一系列方法，通过利用无标签数据、参数高效微调和改进的监督微调来更好地调整 LMs 以适应下游应用，从而提高 LM 的鲁棒性、效率和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在 NLP 领域表现出了卓越的能力，但如何高效、稳健地将其适应于特定任务仍然具有挑战性。随着它们的规模和复杂性不断增长，在标记数据上微调 LM 通常不能充分利用可用的未标记数据，导致在小型的特定于任务的数据集上过度拟合，并带来巨大的计算成本。这些限制阻碍了它们在开放式的现实世界语言任务中的应用。

Method: 本文提出了一系列方法来更好地调整 LMs 以适应下游应用，包括从无标签数据中提取任务相关知识、一种参数高效的微调方法和改进的监督微调方法。

Result: 结果表明，这些方法显著提高了 LM 的鲁棒性、效率和泛化性，使其更适应广泛的应用。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法显著提高了 LM 的鲁棒性、效率和泛化性，使其更适应广泛的应用，为实现通用人工智能的目标迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

### [11] [Leveraging LLM-Assisted Query Understanding for Live Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21384)
*Guanting Dong,Xiaoxi Li,Yuyao Zhang,Mengjie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omni-RAG is a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings by robustly handling complex and noisy queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and contain multiple intents. Current systems typically struggle with such complex inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data.

Method: Omni-RAG employs LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, (2) Intent-Aware Knowledge Retrieval, and (3) Reranking and Generation.

Result: Omni-RAG improves the robustness and effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings.

Conclusion: Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG capabilities and the demands of real-world applications by robustly handling complex and noisy queries.

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了FineWeb2，一个用于训练多语言LLM的20TB多语言数据集，以及相应的流程和代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练高性能的多语言LLM仍然是一个挑战，这主要是由于为大量语言定制过滤和去重流程的固有难度。

Method: 该研究提出了一种新的预训练数据集管理流程，该流程基于FineWeb，可以自动适应以支持任何语言。此外，还提出了一种直接且有原则的方法来重新平衡数据集，该方法同时考虑了重复计数和质量。

Result: 该研究表明，该流程可用于创建非英语语料库，从而产生比以前的数据集性能更高的模型。此外，重新平衡数据集的方法可以进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一个新的基于FineWeb的预训练数据集管理流程，可以自动适应以支持任何语言，并使用超过1000种语言的近100个Common Crawl快照，生成了一个新的20 TB（50亿个文档）多语言数据集FineWeb2，并发布了流程、训练和评估代码库。

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

*Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy,William Tai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在多语言数据库查询生成中的表现，发现英语性能最佳，土耳其语最差，提示翻译影响不大，需要加强多语言支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数研究仅关注英语，对其他语言的评估有限。本文旨在研究基础LLM在多种语言的Text2Cypher任务中的性能。

Method: 创建了一个多语言测试集，将英语问题翻译成西班牙语和土耳其语，同时保留原始的Cypher查询，并使用标准化提示和指标评估了多个基础模型。

Result: 在英语、西班牙语和土耳其语上的性能表现出一致的模式：英语最高，其次是西班牙语，土耳其语最低。这归因于训练数据可用性和语言特征的差异。提示翻译对评估指标几乎没有影响。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在跨语言数据库查询生成任务中表现不一致，英语表现最佳，其次是西班牙语，土耳其语表现最差。提示翻译对性能影响不大。需要在多语言查询生成中进行更全面的评估和开发。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new
standard for a versatile and compact embedding model with less than 1B
parameters.

*Eric Zhang,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种元训练语言模型的方法，该方法允许梯度更新模拟提示，而无需真实标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将新信息纳入语言模型的两种主要方法：更改其提示或更改其参数，例如通过微调。参数更新不会导致模型更改的长期存储成本。但是，对于许多模型更新，提示明显更有效：提示模型可以从单个示例中稳健地概括，并得出在标准微调下不会发生的逻辑推论。模型可以被修改，以便微调可以模拟提示吗？

Method: 一种元训练语言模型的方法，使得梯度更新模仿以新信息为条件所产生的效果。我们的方法使用了基于梯度的元学习工具，但使用语言模型自身提示的预测作为目标，从而消除了对地面实况标签的需求。

Result: 随后的梯度下降训练恢复了一些（偶尔全部）提示模型性能——在“反转诅咒”任务中显示出改进，并在一次梯度更新后回答有关文本段落的问题。

Conclusion: 梯度下降可以非常有效的。我们的结果为长上下文建模提供了新的途径，并提供了对基于梯度的学习的泛化能力的洞察。

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

*Adithya Chittem,Aishna Shrivastava,Sai Tarun Pendela,Jagat Sesh Challa,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current LLM personality models by incorporating the 16PF model and developing a framework for controlling trait intensity, resulting in more consistent and nuanced personality expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM personality models rely on the Big Five framework, which only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for controlling trait intensity.

Method: The method extends the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, and develops a structured framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. It introduces adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors: Frequency, Depth, Threshold, Effort, and Willingness.

Result: Modeling intensity as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related traits in psychologically coherent directions.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel approach to modeling personality in LLMs by extending the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model and developing a structured framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. The results show that modeling intensity as a continuous spectrum yields more consistent and controllable personality expression, and that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related traits in psychologically coherent directions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis
and accurate legal interpretation.

Method: 提出了一种大型语言模型增强的会话关系注意网络 (LLM-CRAN)，该网络利用 LLM 的推理能力来提高会话理解。

Result: LLM-CRAN 在 MT2-CSD 数据集上的有效性进行了广泛的实验评估。实验结果表明，LLM-CRAN 在会话立场检测任务中显著优于强大的基线模型。

Conclusion: LLM-CRAN 在会话立场检测任务中显著优于强大的基线模型。

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

TL;DR: Chunk-based multi-SSL fusion enhances automatic fluency assessment by integrating various SSL models and a CNN-BiLSTM framework, achieving state-of-the-art results on Avalinguo and Speechocean762 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers.

Method: Chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL) models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) with a hierarchical CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero voice activity detection (Silero-VAD).

Result: Improves F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines.

Conclusion: Chunk-based multi-SSL fusion improves fluency evaluation, but generalization to dialects with irregular prosody needs further exploration.

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

TL;DR: DALR通过双层对齐学习解决跨模态错位偏差和模态内语义发散问题，在多模态句子表示学习上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的多模态句子表示学习方法主要集中在粗略层面对齐图像和文本，面临跨模态错位偏差和模态内语义发散这两个关键挑战，这显著降低了句子表示质量。

Method: 提出DALR（多模态句子表示的双层对齐学习）。

Result: 在语义文本相似性（STS）和迁移（TR）任务上的综合实验验证了该方法的有效性，并始终证明其优于最先进的基线。

Conclusion: DALR在语义文本相似性和迁移任务上优于当前最佳基线。

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Conclusion: ComRAG在三个工业CQA数据集上始终优于所有基线，在向量相似度上实现了高达25.9%的改进，延迟降低了8.7%至23.3%，并且在迭代过程中将块增长从20.23%降低至2.06%。

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

Motivation: 自回归语言模型在现代文本生成中占据主导地位，但它们的顺序性质引入了根本的限制：解码速度慢，并且保持全局一致性仍然具有挑战性。扩散模型通过实现并行生成和灵活控制提供了一个有希望的替代方案；然而，它们在文本生成中的应用受到token级别表示的高维性的阻碍。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

Conclusion: 即使是最先进的多模态模型也表现出有限的性能，强调了在智能体奖励建模方面进行专门训练的必要性。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at

Motivation: detect artificially generated text.

Method: statistical classifiers to identify fake text

Result: Gemini showed an increased ability to generate deceptive text, while GPT did not.

Conclusion: reliable detection of fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model architectures may improve their deceptiveness

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as

been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Double-Checker improves LLM reasoning by enabling self-critique and iterative refinement, leading to significant performance gains on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like reasoning, but their ability to generate informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited.

Method: A principled framework called Double-Checker is introduced, which fosters explicit self-critique and iterative refinement of previous solutions by fine-tuning on 1,730 self-critical instances.

Result: Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs.

Conclusion: Double-Checker significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs through iterative self-critique, increasing pass@1 performance on AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2%.

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

TL;DR: This paper uses a text-only language model to extract referring expressions from visually grounded dialogue. It finds that linguistic context is important but the task is inherently multimodal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually grounded dialogue. investigate the extent to which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the conversation.

Method: adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token prediction.

Result: even when using a moderately sized LLM, relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only approach can be effective

Conclusion: A text-only approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the linguistic context. The task represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental to unimodal approaches.

### [32] [Domain Knowledge-Enhanced LLMs for Fraud and Concept Drift Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21443)
*Ali Şenol,Garima Agrawal,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A DK-enhanced LLM framework is proposed to detect deceptive conversations and classify concept drift in dynamic platforms. It achieves high accuracy (98% with LLaMA) by incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD). These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue, making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios.

Method: A Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to perform fraud and concept drift detection. The architecture consists of three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the drift as either benign or fraudulent.

Result: The LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy. Comparative studies against zero-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance, interpretability, and robustness.

Conclusion: The system detects fake conversations with high accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured prompts, the LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy. Comparative studies against zero-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance, interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP applications.

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)\-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk\-sensitive scenarios. To
address these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)\-Enhanced LLM
framework that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task\-specific
insights to perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed
architecture consists of three main components: (1) a DK\-LLM module to detect
fake or deceptive conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine
whether a semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK\-LLM module to
classify the drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value
of domain knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full
framework to SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types
of fraud and spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake
conversations with high accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of
drift. Guided by structured prompts, the LLaMA\-based implementation achieves
98\% classification accuracy. Comparative studies against zero\-shot baselines
demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness
significantly improves performance, interpretability, and robustness in

Motivation: 当前偏好学习方法主要集中于基于文本的语言模型，并不直接适用于实时语音交互的复杂性，实时语音交互具有更丰富的动态（例如，中断、插话）并且在说话者回合之间没有明确的分割。

Method: 利用离线对齐方法来微调全双工自回归语音到语音模型。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了校准各种动态平衡的重要性，这对于自然的实时语音对话系统至关重要。

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

### [34] [TopK Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21468)
*Ryosuke Takahashi,Tatsuro Inaba,Kentaro Inui,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TopK LMs, a modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK activation function at chosen layers, addressing the limitations of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) by eliminating the need for post-hoc training and providing robust interpretability benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across different checkpoints.

Method: We introduce a modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.

Result: The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers.

Conclusion: TopK LMs are stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future research on model interpretability and controllability.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for

experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable

find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过利用对话的未来信号并使用直接偏好优化，该研究旨在提高社交对话中交互式LLM的用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作优化模型以推理相关知识或规划对话行为流程，但用户参与和知识或对话行为之间的关系微妙，不能保证在社交驱动的对话中实现用户参与。

Method: 利用来自对话未来发展的信号，通过i×MCTS与用户模拟器交互，收集高质量经验数据集，并通过直接偏好优化（DPO）对交互式LLM进行对齐。

Result: 在两个社交驱动的对话场景（情感支持对话和说服向善）中进行的实验表明，该方法有效地增强了交互式LLM中的用户参与度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地增强了交互式LLM中的用户参与度。

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

Motivation: What justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities based on its answers to a curated set of questions?

Method: Two procedures for quantifying the existence of potemkins: a specially designed benchmark in three domains, and a general procedure providing a lower-bound on their prevalence.

Result: Potemkins are ubiquitous across models, tasks, and domains. These failures reflect not just incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept representations.

Conclusion: Potemkin understanding is ubiquitous across models, tasks, and domains, reflecting deeper internal incoherence in concept representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 MIL 方法通常无法明确地捕获 WSI 内的病理异质性，包括全局的——通过长尾形态分布，以及局部的——通过 tile 水平的预测不确定性。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于最优传输视角的 MIL 框架 OTSurv。

Result: OTSurv 在六个常用基准测试中取得了新的最先进的结果，在平均 C 指数上实现了 3.6% 的绝对改进。

Conclusion: OTSurv 在六个常用基准测试中取得了新的最先进的结果，在平均 C 指数上实现了 3.6% 的绝对改进。此外，OTSurv 在对数秩检验中实现了统计显着性，并提供高可解释性。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: StereoDiff结合立体匹配和视频深度扩散，实现了更一致和准确的视频深度估计，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度估计并非图像深度估计的简单扩展。视频中动态和静态区域的时间一致性要求存在根本差异。静态区域的深度可以通过立体匹配更有效地实现，而动态区域的一致性仍应从大规模视频深度数据中学习。

Method: 提出的StereoDiff是一种两阶段视频深度估计器，它协同利用立体匹配（主要用于静态区域）和视频深度扩散（用于保持动态区域中一致的深度过渡）。

Result: 在零样本、真实世界的动态视频深度基准测试中，StereoDiff表现出SoTA性能。

Conclusion: StereoDiff在动态视频深度估计方面表现出色，具有卓越的一致性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

Motivation: 视觉和触觉是机器人两种基本的感知方式，提供互补信息以增强感知和操作任务。以往的研究试图共同学习视觉-触觉表征，以提取更有意义的信息。然而，这些方法通常依赖于直接组合，例如特征相加和连接，来进行模态融合，这往往导致较差的特征整合。

Method: 使用对比表示来增强融合期间的特征对齐，利用对比编码器通过自监督对比学习进行预训练，以将视觉和触觉输入投影到统一的潜在嵌入中。这些嵌入用于通过交叉模态注意力耦合视觉-触觉特征融合。

Result: ConViTac优于当前最先进的方法，并且我们提出的CEC机制有效。

Conclusion: ConViTac在材料分类和抓取预测任务中，精度提高了12.0%。

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

*Connor Ludwig,Khashayar Namdar,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks promptable segmentation models on BraTS 2023, finding SAM models competitive with accurate bounding boxes but nnU-Net superior overall. Fine-tuning improves SAM performance with point prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of evaluation and comparison of promptable models across prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.

Method: Utilizing SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net for zero-shot inference on BraTS 2023 using various prompt qualities, followed by fine-tuning SAM variants on the pediatrics dataset.

Result: SAM and SAM 2 achieve Dice scores up to 0.894 and 0.893 with accurate bounding box prompts, exceeding nnU-Net. Fine-tuning improves point prompt performance substantially.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning SAM-based models improves point prompt performance, but still lags behind bounding boxes and nnU-Net.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了调整视觉基础模型（VFM）和视觉语言模型（VLM）用于动态全身手势识别，并引入了NUGGET数据集来评估不同的手势识别方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，基于深度学习的手势识别依赖于使用图像、视频或骨骼姿势估计作为输入的特定于任务的架构。同时，具有强大泛化能力的视觉基础模型（VFM）和视觉语言模型（VLM）有望通过取代专用任务特定模块来降低系统复杂性。

Method: 研究比较了V-JEPA（一种最先进的VFM）、Gemini Flash 2.0（一种多模态VLM）和HD-GCN（一种表现最佳的基于骨骼的方法），以适应动态的全身手势识别。

Result: HD-GCN取得了最佳性能，但V-JEPA通过一个简单的、特定于任务的分类头紧随其后。Gemini难以区分手势。

Conclusion: HD-GCN在实验中表现最佳，但V-JEPA通过简单的、特定于任务的分类头紧随其后，这为通过使用它作为共享多任务模型来降低系统复杂性铺平了可能的道路。相比之下，Gemini难以仅根据零样本设置中的文本描述来区分手势，突出了对手势的合适输入表示进行进一步研究的必要性。

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

### [45] [Leveraging Vision-Language Models to Select Trustworthy Super-Resolution Samples Generated by Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20832)
*Cansu Korkmaz,Ahmet Murat Tekalp,Zafer Dogan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper uses vision-language models to pick the best super-resolution images generated by diffusion models, and introduces a new metric called Trustworthiness Score (TWS) that aligns with human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem where regressive SR models introduce artifacts and diffusion models generate diverse SR images but lack a way to select the most trustworthy solution.

Method: The paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs).

Result: The paper empirically shows that TWS correlates strongly with human preference and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield high TWS values. The approach offers a principled, scalable, and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR space.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR by aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

TL;DR: FixCLR, a semi-supervised domain generalization method, uses contrastive learning with pseudo-labels and a repelling term for domain invariance, improving performance, especially with other semi-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing SSDG methods do not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization

Method: introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels and using only a repelling term

Result: FixCLR can also be added on top of most existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many domains.

Conclusion: FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when combined with other semi-supervised methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance

combined with other semi-supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的对比学习框架，用于像素级自监督预训练，以提高医学视觉基础模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将对比学习 (CL) 扩展到对于医学视觉至关重要的像素级表示仍然是一个开放的问题。标准的CL将SSP公式化为一个二元优化问题 (binary CL)，过度追求特征分散会导致过度分散问题，打破像素级特征相关性，从而扰乱类内分布。

Method: 将对比学习重新表述为向量回归问题，通过对位移向量中的特征距离进行建模，从而在像素级预训练中实现分散量化。提出了COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER)框架。

Result: 在跨越2个维度和4个模态的8个任务中进行的大量实验表明

Conclusion: COVER显著提高了像素级的自监督预训练，从而推进了通用医学视觉基础模型。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

Motivation: 准确识别模糊的面部表情对于实际应用至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种数据增强方法 MIDAS，旨在提高 DFER 在模糊面部表情数据上的性能，该方法使用代表多个情感类别概率的软标签。

Result: 在 DFEW 数据集和 FERV39k-Plus（一个新构建的为现有 DFER 数据集分配软标签的数据集）上进行的实验表明，使用 MIDAS 增强数据训练的模型取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 模型在用 MIDAS 增强的数据上训练后，与在原始数据集上训练的最新方法相比，取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation methods often overlook explicit monocular cues that the human visual system relies on.

Method: A cue-aware pipeline that deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen networks.

Result: The cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. Quantitative results will appear in a future revision.

Conclusion: ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline, fuses explicit monocular cues through a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3) with a key-value working-memory module and an adaptive-bins transformer head to produce a high-resolution disparity map.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

*Hani Alomari,Anushka Sivakumar,Andrew Zhang,Chris Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的跨模态图像-文本检索方法，该方法通过优化嵌入集之间的一对一匹配并引入新的损失函数来解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态图像-文本检索具有挑战性，因为来自不同模态的内容之间可能存在多种关联。传统方法学习单向量嵌入来表示每个样本的语义，但难以捕捉跨模态存在的细微和多样化的关系。基于集合的方法提供了一种有希望的替代方案，因为它们可以用多个嵌入来表示每个样本，从而可以捕获更丰富和更多样化的关系。然而，这些基于集合的表示仍然面临诸如稀疏监督和集合崩溃等问题，这限制了它们的有效性。

Method: 提出最大配对分配相似度来优化嵌入集之间的一对一匹配，从而保持集合内的语义多样性。引入全局判别损失以增强嵌入之间的区别，并引入集合内散度损失以防止每个集合内的崩溃。

Result: 该方法在MS-COCO和Flickr30k上实现了最先进的性能，且不依赖于外部数据。

Conclusion: 该方法在MS-COCO和Flickr30k上实现了最先进的性能，且不依赖于外部数据。

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

Motivation: Generating images with multiple humans performing complex actions while preserving facial identities is challenging, partly due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark.

Method: The paper proposes a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics: face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. Novel techniques incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching.

Result: The paper conducts a thorough evaluation of diverse models and demonstrates improved ID similarity using proposed techniques. The benchmark and key findings offer insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

The benchmark includes text prompts, pose conditioning images, and a multi-faceted evaluation suite. The paper also proposes techniques to improve ID similarity.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging multi-turn image editing tasks

Method: combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A* search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath

Result: The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images, yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent FaSTA*: fast subtask planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A* search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks.

Conclusion: FaSTA* is significantly more computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of success rate.

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

Motivation: 基于深度学习的方法在像素级伪造定位方面取得了很高的精度，但它们经常难以应对计算开销和有限的表示能力，特别是对于细微或复杂的篡改。

Method: M2SFormer，一种新的基于Transformer编码器的框架，旨在克服这些挑战。它在跳跃连接中统一了多频和多尺度注意力，利用全局上下文来更好地捕获不同的伪造工件。此外，该框架通过利用全局先验图（一种曲率指标，指示伪造定位的难度）来解决上采样过程中精细细节的丢失问题，然后指导一个难度引导的注意力模块，以更有效地保留细微的操作。

Result: M2SFormer优于现有的最先进模型，并在检测和定位跨未见域的伪造品方面提供卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: M2SFormer在多个基准数据集上优于现有模型，并在检测和定位跨未见域的伪造品方面提供卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

Motivation: Existing approaches predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), which introduces artifacts such as volume loss and unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials.

Method: A differentiable physics-based skinning and rigging framework that embeds the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation, simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated skeleton. It leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid. Material prototypes are introduced to reduce the learning space.

Conclusion: The proposed PhysRig framework outperforms traditional LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible results, and demonstrates versatility in articulated object modeling through pose transfer tasks.

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object

*Dejie Yang,Zhu Xu,Xinjie Gao,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HST-CSLR to improve continuous sign language recognition by combining gloss knowledge with visual representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck for continuous sign language recognition (CSLR).

Method: The paper proposes a Hierarchical Sub-action Tree (HST) to combine gloss knowledge with visual representation learning. It aligns visual and textual modalities step-by-step and uses contrastive alignment enhancement.

Result: Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HST-CSLR.

Conclusion: The paper introduces HST-CSLR and demonstrates its effectiveness on four datasets.

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

distinctive features: (i) Full-modal collaboration: We design evaluation tasks
that highlight the strong coupling between audio and video, requiring models to
effectively leverage the collaborative perception of all modalities; (ii)
Diversity of videos: OmniEval includes 810 audio-visual synchronized videos,
285 Chinese videos and 525 English videos; (iii) Diversity and granularity of
tasks: OmniEval contains 2617 question-answer pairs, comprising 1412 open-ended
questions and 1205 multiple-choice questions. These questions are divided into
3 major task types and 12 sub-task types to achieve comprehensive evaluation.
Among them, we introduce a more granular video localization task named
Grounding. Then we conduct experiments on OmniEval with several omni-modality
models. We hope that our OmniEval can provide a platform for evaluating the
ability to construct and understand coherence from the context of all
modalities. Codes and data could be found at https://omnieval.github.io/.

Motivation: 现有的计算病理学多模态大语言模型 (MLLM) 存在训练数据不足、缺乏对多图像理解的支持和评估以及缺乏自主诊断推理能力等局限性。

Method: 开发了一种新的 MLLM，PathChat+，并使用 SlideSeek，一个多代理 AI 系统。

Result: PathChat+ 在各种病理学基准测试中显著优于先前的 PathChat copilot 以及最先进的通用模型和其他病理学专用模型。SlideSeek 在 DDxBench 上达到了高精度，并且能够生成可视化的、人类可解释的总结报告。

Conclusion: PathChat+ 在病理学基准测试中表现出色，SlideSeek 实现了高准确率和可解释的报告。

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide
images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching
high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis
benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded,

TL;DR: DFVEdit是一种高效的零样本视频编辑方法，专为Video DiTs设计，通过流变换在潜在空间中操作，避免了注意力修改和微调，实现了快速和低内存的视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接将现有的视频编辑方法应用于Video DiTs通常会产生大量的计算开销，这是因为资源密集型的注意力修改或微调。

Method: 通过流变换直接在干净的潜在空间上操作，无需修改注意力和微调。提出了条件Delta流向量（CDFV），并集成了隐式交叉注意（ICA）指导以及嵌入增强（ER）以进一步提高编辑质量。

Result: DFVEdit在实际效率方面表现出色，与基于注意力工程的编辑方法相比，在Video DiTs上至少提供20倍的推理速度提升和85%的内存减少。

Conclusion: DFVEdit可以无缝应用于流行的Video DiTs（例如，CogVideoX和Wan2.1），在结构保真度、时空一致性和编辑质量方面都达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Cradle2Cane的两阶段面部老化框架，该框架在年龄准确性和身份一致性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在整个生命周期内实现逼真和无缝的转换，尤其是在处理大年龄差距或极端头部姿势时，核心挑战在于平衡年龄准确性和身份保持。

Method: 基于few-step text-to-image (T2I) 扩散模型，提出了一个名为Cradle2Cane的两阶段面部老化框架。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ测试数据集上进行了大量实验，通过Face++和Qwen-VL协议进行评估，表明Cradle2Cane优于现有的面部老化方法。

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane在年龄准确性和身份一致性方面优于现有的面部老化方法。

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

*Weichen Dai,Kangcheng Ma,Jiaxin Wang,Kecen Pan,Yuhang Ming,Hua Zhang,Wanzeng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel 3D scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization to address the problem of photometric distortions in multi-view images. The method achieves high-quality 3D scene representations even under imaging degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the quality of the representation.

Method: propose a novel 3D scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene representation from fitting scene-unrelated information.

Result: the proposed method constructs a complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

Conclusion: The proposed method can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

TL;DR: SP-Ctrl：一种用于姿势引导图像生成的新型空间-姿势ControlNet，它优于稀疏姿势引导下的现有方法，甚至可以与密集信号方法相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集表示提出了新的挑战，包括编辑困难和与文本提示的潜在不一致。稀疏信号的简单性和形状无关性未被充分探索。

Method: 扩展OpenPose到可学习的空间表示，使关键点嵌入具有区分性和表达性。引入关键点概念学习，这鼓励关键点tokens关注每个关键点的空间位置，从而提高姿势对齐。

Result: 在以动物和人类为中心的图像生成任务上的实验表明，SP-Ctrl在稀疏姿势引导下优于最近的空间可控T2I生成方法，甚至与基于密集信号的方法的性能相匹配。

Conclusion: SP-Ctrl在稀疏姿势引导下优于最近的空间可控T2I生成方法，甚至与基于密集信号的方法的性能相匹配。SP-Ctrl在通过稀疏信号进行多样化和跨物种生成方面显示出有希望的能力。

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 CZSL 方法通常通过简单的组合-原型映射来推导原始特征，这对于可以分为不同语义子集的个体集合来说是次优的。此外，全对一的跨模态原始匹配忽略了相同状态或对象内的组合差异，限制了细粒度的图像组合对齐。

Method: 提出了 EVA，一个用于 CZSL 的混合专家语义变体对齐框架。引入了领域专家适配，利用多个专家来实现 token 感知学习和建模高质量的原始表示。提出了语义变体对齐，以选择语义相关的表示用于图像-原始匹配。

Result: 该方法在三个流行的基准上显著优于其他最先进的 CZSL 方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在封闭和开放世界的三个流行基准上显著优于其他最先进的 CZSL 方法，证明了所提出见解的有效性。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work

Result: achieves state-of-the-art performance

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation datasets.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method generates multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific

aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more

Conclusion: 该模型在动态模糊场景下的新视角合成方面实现了稳健的性能，并在模糊单目视频输入的真实新视角合成方面建立了一个新的基准。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical

The paper also attempts to recover the removed text content by training a text recognizer to understand its difficulty.

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

TL;DR: VisionGuard, a multi-stage framework with Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules, improves helmet violation detection by 3.1% mAP compared to baseline detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and disrupt consistent object classification.

Method: VisionGuard integrates Adaptive Labeling (a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances classification consistency) and Contextual Expander modules (improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating virtual bounding boxes).

Result: VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors.

Conclusion: VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的深度学习框架 FFCL-SAM，用于提高术中边缘评估的速度和准确性，有可能减少乳腺癌的再切除率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D 标本放射线照相 (SR) 的准确性有限，导致近四分之一的患者需要额外的手术。

Method: 结合了 Segment Anything Model (SAM) 与 Forward-Forward 对比学习 (FFCL) 的新型深度学习框架

Result: 边缘分类的 AUC 达到 0.8455，分割边缘的 Dice 相似性比基线模型提高了 27.4%，同时将每张图像的推理时间缩短到 47 毫秒。

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM 显著提高了术中边缘评估的速度和准确性，具有降低再切除率和改善乳腺癌治疗效果的强大潜力。

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

Motivation: 我们介绍了衰老多元宇宙，这是一个从单个图像生成多个合理的面部衰老轨迹的框架，每个轨迹都以环境、健康和生活方式等外部因素为条件。与先前将衰老建模为单一确定性路径的方法不同，我们的方法创建了一个衰老树，可以可视化不同的未来。

Method: 我们提出了一种免训练的基于扩散的方法，该方法平衡了身份保留、年龄准确性和条件控制。我们的主要贡献包括用于调节编辑强度的注意力混合和用于稳定编辑的模拟老化正则化策略。

Result: 广泛的实验和用户研究表明，该方法在身份保留、衰老真实感和条件对齐方面表现出最先进的性能，优于现有的编辑和年龄增长模型，这些模型通常无法考虑一个或多个编辑标准。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将衰老转化为多维、可控和可解释的过程，在数字故事讲述、健康教育和个性化可视化方面开辟了新的创造性和实践途径。

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR approaches for novel view synthesis are mentally demanding, limit capture areas, and rely on restrictive sampling theory and 3D annotations.

Method: using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be removed by inserting new views

Result: error-peaking visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment, and is satisfactory with fewer view samples. It also contributes to radiance field reconstruction for larger scenes

Conclusion: The error-peaking visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. The approach can contribute to recent radiance field reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

### [75] [Bridging Video Quality Scoring and Justification via Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21011)
*Qizhi Xie,Kun Yuan,Yunpeng Qu,Jiachao Gong,Mingda Wu,Ming Sun,Chao Zhou,Jihong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for video quality assessment using large multimodal models (LMMs) and instruction tuning. It proposes a Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline to create a large dataset (S2I) of instruction-response pairs, and a benchmark (S2I-Bench) to evaluate the quality justification capacity of video LMMs. The results show improvements in quality scoring and justification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score that fails to describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability. Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness.

Method: The paper proposes a Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline that scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled video, maps scores to text-defined levels, and incorporates a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific dimensions and overall quality.

Result: The resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs. The paper also introduces S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to evaluate the quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that the proposed method consistently improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video LMMs.

Conclusion: The proposed Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline and the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset improve quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video LMMs, as demonstrated by experimental results on the S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity in federated learning (FL), which refers to the biased labeling preferences at multiple clients, is a major challenge. Existing FL methods often neglect inherent semantic information contained in each client.

Method: The paper proposes Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC) to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous clients by constructing relational prototypes and consistent prototypes at the semantic-level. It introduces an inter-contrastive learning strategy and devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner.

Result: FedSC can capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous clients and the experimental results on various challenging scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial components.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical analysis for FedSC to ensure a convergence guarantee and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial components.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions.

Method: A multimodal prompt alignment framework (MPA-FER) is proposed, which includes a multi-granularity hard prompt generation strategy using a large language model (LLM), prototype-guided visual feature alignment, and a cross-modal global-local alignment module.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MPA-FER framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained model and minimizing computational costs.

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively, while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%.

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance

propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of

Motivation: Reducing the computational demands of modeling high-resolution images and improving the efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation.

Method: The paper introduces 1D binary image latents, representing images as sequences of binary vectors.

Result: The paper achieves competitive performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128 discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. It also allows for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node and training completion within 200 GPU days.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel 1D binary latent space for image tokenization, achieving competitive performance in text-to-image generation with significantly reduced token numbers and improved training/inference speed, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional methods.

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that

First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal

caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data

Conclusion: FGS achieves superior faithfulness while maintaining editability and its compatibility with various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

Conclusion: 扰乱自监督ViT提取的双重深度特征，实现了卓越的黑盒迁移性，优于现有技术。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for
real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this
paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new task called Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching (RoI-Matching) and proposes a new framework RoI-Matcher to address it. The framework uses a Siamese network and cross-attention layers to match customized regions in documents. A new benchmark dataset, RoI-Matching-Bench, is also introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document analysis solutions are not suitable for flexible applications customized by users.

Method: A Siamese network is used to extract multi-level features, and cross-attention layers integrate and align similar semantics in different domains.

Result: The proposed method is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench.

Conclusion: The proposed RoI-Matcher framework, with its Siamese network and cross-attention layers, is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench and serves as a baseline for future research.

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

TL;DR: SAMURAI：一种形状感知的多模态检索方法，用于3D对象识别，它结合了CLIP语义匹配和形状引导的重新排序，在ROOMELSA私有测试集上实现了有竞争力的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅使用一个带掩码的2D图像和一个自然语言描述在复杂的室内环境中检索3D对象提出了重大挑战。ROOMELSA挑战限制了对完整3D场景上下文的访问，使得关于对象外观、几何形状和语义的推理变得复杂。扭曲的视点、无纹理的掩码区域、模棱两可的语言提示和嘈杂的分割掩码加剧了这些挑战。

Method: SAMURAI集成了基于CLIP的语义匹配和从掩码区域的二值轮廓导出的形状引导的重新排序，以及一种鲁棒的多数投票策略。一个专门的预处理管道通过提取最大的连接组件和去除背景噪声来增强掩码质量。我们的混合检索框架利用语言和形状线索。

Result: 我们的混合检索框架利用语言和形状线索，在ROOMELSA私有测试集上实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 结合形状先验知识和语言理解对于鲁棒的开放世界3D对象检索至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

TL;DR: PoseMaster是一个端到端的可控3D角色生成框架，它统一了姿势变换和3D角色生成，优于现有技术，并能实现精确的任意姿势控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高3D角色建模的效率，最近基于图像的方法使用两个单独的模型来实现A-pose角色的姿势标准化和3D重建。然而，由于自我遮挡和视点，这些方法容易在姿势标准化阶段生成扭曲和退化的图像，这进一步影响了后续重建过程的几何质量。

Method: 将姿势变换和3D角色生成统一到一个基于流的3D原生生成框架中。利用可动画角色骨骼中存在的3D身体骨骼作为姿势条件。在训练过程中，随机清空姿势条件和图像条件，以提高姿势控制的有效性和泛化性。创建一个高质量的姿势控制数据集，该数据集源自真实的字符动画数据，以使模型学习骨骼和蒙皮权重之间的隐式关系。

Result: PoseMaster在A-pose角色生成方面优于当前最先进的技术，并在定性和定量评估中展示了其实现任意姿势精确控制的强大能力。

Conclusion: PoseMaster在A-pose角色生成方面优于当前最先进的技术，并在定性和定量评估中展示了其实现任意姿势精确控制的强大能力。

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态推理模型，通过强化学习和全局上下文理解来解决现有模型中存在的上下文理解不足和shortcut问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大型语言模型的快速发展，深入理解和解释人类意图的能力已成为一项关键能力，这需要详细和周密的推理。在最近的研究中，强化学习（RL）已证明在增强大型语言模型（LLM）的推理能力方面具有潜力。然而，将RL适应于多模态数据和格式相关的挑战在很大程度上仍未解决。在本文中，我们发现了现有多模态推理模型中的两个问题：全局上下文理解不足和shortcut问题。

Method: 为了确保准确解释多模态上下文信息，我们实施了由大型语言模型判断的上下文奖励，以及格式和准确性奖励。此外，为了提高复杂的推理能力，我们采用LLM来评估逻辑奖励，确定推理过程是否成功地将多模态信息与逻辑方法相结合。我们还引入了一个推理全模态基准，IntentBench，旨在评估模型在理解复杂人类意图和情感方面的能力。

Result: 我们的方法在多个全模态基准测试中表现出先进的性能，优于其他开源全模态模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个全模态基准测试中表现出先进的性能，优于其他开源全模态模型。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of VideoLLMs in multi-shot scenarios by introducing a new dataset (MultiClip-Bench) and a new model (IPFormer-VideoLLM) that injects instance-level features. Both dataset and model improve performance on multi-scene video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs struggle with multi-shot scenarios due to the lack of multi-shot annotations in existing datasets and the discrete/lossy encoding of instance features in current models.

Method: The authors introduce a new dataset termed MultiClip-Bench and a new model IPFormer-VideoLLM.

Result: The proposed dataset and model enhance the multi-scene video understanding significantly and offer distinct advantages across various video benchmarks.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a new model IPFormer-VideoLLM that injects instance-level features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector, enhancing multi-scene video understanding.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with small-scale cost volumes. The compact version of ESMStereo achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX Orin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major challenge in computer vision.  accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost volumes which require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale cost volumes lack sufficient information to ensure highly accurate disparity estimation.

Method: The Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) is proposed to mitigate information loss associated with small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene geometry.

Result: The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a highly accurate disparity map at real-time.

Conclusion: The compact version of ESMStereo achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX Orin.

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for change detection are becoming increasingly complex and computationally demanding without significant accuracy gains. There is a need for lightweight models that maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, especially for on-satellite processing.

Method: The paper proposes FlickCD, which includes an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) and Local-Global Fusion Blocks with Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global Self-Attention (EGSA).

Result: FlickCD reduces computational and storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1% F1) accuracy trade-off on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FlickCD achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational and storage overheads.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their capacity to diagnose critical failures.

Method: introduce HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually coherent scene edits.

Result: Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones.

Conclusion: Vision-driven hallucinations are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the

instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential
for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a
robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and
segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly
addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data
heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and
extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute
and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth
segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader
clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image
enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the
environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1

references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业场景中的表面缺陷检测至关重要，但技术要求很高，因为缺陷类型、不规则形状和尺寸、细粒度要求以及复杂的材料纹理差异很大。虽然最近基于人工智能的探测器的进步提高了性能，但现有方法通常存在特征冗余、细节敏感性有限以及多尺度条件下鲁棒性较弱的问题。

Method: YOLO-FDA，一种基于YOLO的新型检测框架，集成了细粒度细节增强和注意力引导的特征融合。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA在各种类型的缺陷和尺度上，在准确性和鲁棒性方面始终优于现有的最先进方法。

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

TL;DR: Video-X^2L通过双层KV压缩和选择性KV重载，在长视频理解任务中优于现有KV压缩方法，并节省计算成本，且无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）在长视频理解（LVU）方面面临严峻挑战，这主要是由于计算成本过高。最近的方法探索了KV压缩来缓解这个问题，但它们通常在高压缩率下会遭受严重的信息损失。

Method: 双层KV压缩和选择性KV重载

Result: Video-X^2L优于现有的KV压缩方法，同时显著节省了计算成本。

Conclusion: Video-X^2L在各种流行的LVU基准测试中优于现有的KV压缩方法，同时显著节省了计算成本。

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

Motivation: 常用的生物医学分割任务学习方法会同等惩罚所有错误，因此无法利用标签空间中的任何类间语义。

Result: 在包含临床定义的语义树结构组织的 107 个类别的稀疏注释 HSI 数据集上，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏注释的 HSI 数据集上达到了最先进的性能，并且能够有效检测 OOD 像素，而不会影响 ID 像素的分割性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

TL;DR: BitMark，一个强大的用于 Infinity 的逐位水印框架，它在令牌流的比特级别嵌入水印，以防止图像生成模型中的模型崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着他们的输出越来越多地出现在互联网上，它们可能会被抓取并重新用作训练数据——可能被相同的模型使用。这种现象已被证明会导致模型崩溃，在这种情况下，重复训练生成的内容，尤其是来自模型自身先前版本的内容，会导致性能逐渐下降。

Method: 我们的方法在 Infinity 的图像生成过程中，直接在跨多个尺度（也称为分辨率）的令牌流的比特级别嵌入水印。

Result: 我们的逐位水印巧妙地影响了这些位，以保持视觉保真度和生成速度，同时对各种移除技术保持稳健性。此外，它还具有高放射性，即当水印生成的图像用于训练另一个图像生成模型时，第二个模型的输出也将带有水印。即使仅在用水印 BitMark 添加水印的图像上微调扩散或图像自回归模型时，放射性痕迹仍然可以检测到。

Conclusion: 该方法为防止图像生成模型中的模型崩溃提供了一个有原则的步骤，因为它能够可靠地检测生成的输出。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for generating 3D objects from single-view images often suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric detail.

Method: The method integrates geometry and perception priors by training three Gaussian branches initialized from geometry prior, perception prior and Gaussian noise, refining them through mutual interaction and a reprojection-based strategy for depth consistency.

Result: The proposed method achieves higher-fidelity reconstruction results and outperforms existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates a method that achieves higher-fidelity reconstruction results, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, leading to robust and consistent 3D object generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于对象点云 Sim2Real UDA 的新型拓扑感知建模 (TAM) 框架，该框架利用全局空间拓扑，并通过一种新的自监督学习任务对局部几何特征的拓扑关系进行建模，从而缓解域间隙。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从 3D 对象形状的点集学习语义表示通常会受到显着几何变化的挑战，这主要是由于数据采集方法的差异。通常，训练数据是使用点模拟器生成的，而测试数据是使用不同的 3D 传感器收集的，从而导致模拟到现实 (Sim2Real) 域的差距，从而限制了点分类器的泛化能力。当前的无监督域自适应 (UDA) 技术难以解决这一差距，因为它们通常缺乏能够捕获全局拓扑信息的鲁棒、域不敏感的描述符，从而导致过度拟合源域的有限语义模式。

Method: 利用全局空间拓扑，通过低级、高频 3D 结构来表征，并通过一种新的自监督学习任务对局部几何特征的拓扑关系进行建模。此外，我们还提出了一种先进的自训练策略，该策略将跨域对比学习与自训练相结合，有效地减少了噪声伪标签的影响，并增强了适应过程的鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个公共 Sim2Real 基准测试上的实验结果验证了我们的 TAM 框架的有效性，表明在所有评估任务中，该框架都优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的拓扑感知建模（TAM）框架在三个公共 Sim2Real 基准测试上进行了实验验证，结果表明，在所有评估任务中，该框架都优于最先进的方法。

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available

Conclusion: 该论文引入了时间推理能力到现有的3DVG模型，并在SG3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: differences in feature channel attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal matching

Method: Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces local selection with global optimization

Result: Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and 7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method

Conclusion: achieving state-of-the-art performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

*Yihong Cao,Jiaming Zhang,Xu Zheng,Hao Shi,Kunyu Peng,Hang Liu,Kailun Yang,Hui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task, SFOASS, and a solution, UNLOCK, for panoramic image segmentation without needing source data, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods require access to source pinhole data.

Method: The UNLOCK framework includes Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning.

Result: The source-free method achieves performance comparable to source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and 11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the source-only method.

Conclusion: The proposed source-free method achieves performance comparable to source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and 11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the source-only method.

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: 本次会议旨在支持人工智能安全领域的研究，确定了该领域的研究重点，并将人工智能安全研究领域分为开发、评估和控制三个类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速提升的人工智能能力和自主性带来了巨大的变革希望，但也引发了关于如何确保人工智能安全（即可信、可靠和安全）的激烈争论。建立一个值得信赖的生态系统至关重要——它可以帮助人们充满信心地接受人工智能，并在避免强烈反对的同时为创新提供最大的空间。

Method: 采用纵深防御模型，将人工智能安全研究领域分为三类：创建可信人工智能系统的挑战（开发）、评估其风险的挑战（评估）以及部署后进行监控和干预的挑战（控制）。

Result: 本报告建立在 Yoshua Bengio 主持并得到 33 个政府支持的国际人工智能安全报告的基础上。

Conclusion: 本报告总结了“2025 年新加坡人工智能会议（SCAI）：人工智能安全国际科学交流会”的研究成果，该会议旨在通过聚集来自不同地区的人工智能科学家，以识别和综合人工智能安全领域的研究重点。

Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of
transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI
is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem
is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives
maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific
Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing
together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research
priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI
Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By
adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research
domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems
(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and
challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

*Gurusha Juneja,Alon Albalak,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with contextual privacy in collaborative tasks, often leaking private info despite instructions, and hindering task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy is critical in multi-agent collaboration systems where agents access proprietary tools and domain-specific databases. Existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating contextual privacy in LLM-agents.

Method: A new benchmark MAGPIE comprising 158 real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains is presented to evaluate LLMs' understanding of contextual privacy and their ability to collaborate without violating user privacy.

Result: Current models, including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, misclassify private data as shareable 25.2% and 43.6% of the time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in 59.9% and 50.5% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions. Multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71% of scenarios.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack robust understanding of contextual privacy and fail to preserve user privacy in multi-turn conversations, hindering collaborative task-solving.

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

Conclusion: This paper presents a dynamic context-aware prompt recommendation system that achieves high usefulness and relevance.

Abstract: LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user
prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially
for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic
context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications.
Our solution combines contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge
grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking to
generate relevant and actionable prompt suggestions.
  The system leverages behavioral telemetry and a two-stage hierarchical
reasoning process to dynamically select and rank relevant skills, and
synthesizes prompts using both predefined and adaptive templates enhanced with
few-shot learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework and dataset to assess and improve the long-term safety awareness of language models, showing promising results in predicting and preventing indirect harm scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the beneficial impact of language model-based agents on high-stakes societal decisions requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their suggestions.

Method: A proof-of-concept framework is proposed to project how model-generated advice propagates through societal systems, along with a dataset of 100 indirect harm scenarios to test models' ability to foresee adverse outcomes.

Result: The approach achieves over 20% improvement on the new dataset and an average win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study's approach achieves significant improvements on a new dataset and existing safety benchmarks, suggesting a promising direction for safer agents.

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks
(AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer
agents.

### [115] [Unveiling Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: Reality or Mirage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21215)
*Haoang Chi,He Li,Wenjing Yang,Feng Liu,Long Lan,Xiaoguang Ren,Tongliang Liu,Bo Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs primarily perform shallow causal reasoning. The paper introduces CausalProbe-2024 to demonstrate this and proposes G^2-Reasoner to enhance LLMs' causal reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models (LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine human-like (level-2) causal reasoning.

Method: We delve into the autoregression mechanism of transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.  We introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal reasoning processes.

Result: The LLMs exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and counterfactual contexts.

Conclusion: This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making strides towards level-2.

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了WAP框架，显著提升了LVLMs在复杂具身规划任务中的性能，优于现有方法和专有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于环境无关的模仿学习，导致模型难以处理上下文相关的指令，并在长时程交互中依赖补充线索而非视觉推理。

Method: 该论文提出了World-Aware Planning Narrative Enhancement (WAP) 框架，通过视觉外观建模、空间推理、功能抽象和句法 grounding 四种认知能力，增强 LVLMs 的环境理解。

Result: 在EB-ALFRED基准测试中，Qwen2.5-VL的任务成功率提高了60.7%，尤其是在常识推理（+60.0）和长时程规划（+70.0）方面。

Conclusion: 该论文通过WAP框架，显著提升了LVLMs在具身规划任务中的性能，尤其是在常识推理和长时程规划方面，优于GPT-4o和Claude-3.5-Sonnet等专有系统。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

Method: 开发了一个名为IXAII的交互式可解释智能系统，该系统提供来自四种可解释AI方法的解释：LIME、SHAP、Anchors和DiCE。

Result: 专家和普通用户的访谈表明，IXAII提供了不同解释和多种可视化选项，有助于提高透明度。

Conclusion: IXAII通过提供多种可视化选项的不同解释，被认为有助于提高透明度。

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,
most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness
for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable
intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable
AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored
views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on
AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: AI科学发现需要弥合抽象、推理和现实差距，依赖内部模型、外部验证和人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能系统在科学发现中受到操作架构、脆弱的推理机制以及与实验现实分离的限制。

Method: 定义了用于科学发现的主动推理AI系统，该系统包含因果自监督基础模型、符号或神经符号规划器、持久知识图和闭环交互。

Result: 概述了一种架构，其中发现源于内部模型（支持反事实推理）和外部验证（将假设建立在现实基础上）之间的相互作用。

Conclusion: AI驱动的科学发现需要内部模型和外部验证之间的相互作用，以及人类判断的持续参与。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts architecture, addresses the challenges of multimodal table understanding in real-world contexts. It features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited performance and poor generalization.

Method: propose TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture featuring an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism

Result: TableMoE significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and structured expert alignment.

Conclusion: TableMoE significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型无法仅从几个视图想象完整的场景。通过构建空间心理模型，可以显著提高对不可观察空间的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型 (VLM) 无法像人类一样，仅从几个视图想象完整的场景。人类形成空间心理模型，即看不见的空间的内部表征，以推理布局、视角和运动。MindCube 基准测试揭示了这一关键差距，其中现有的 VLM 表现出接近随机的性能。

Method: 提出了三种方法来帮助 VLM 逼近空间心理模型，包括未见过的中间视图、自然语言推理链和认知地图。采用了一种协同方法“map-then-reason”，该方法联合训练模型以首先生成认知地图，然后再对其进行推理。使用强化学习进一步提高了性能。

Result: 通过训练模型以推理这些内部地图，准确率从 37.8% 提高到 60.8%（+23.0%）。添加强化学习将性能进一步提升至 70.7%（+32.9%）。

Conclusion: 通过构建和利用内部结构化的空间表征以及灵活的推理过程，可以显著提高对不可观察空间的理解。

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

TL;DR: Introduces AH2AC2, a challenge with human proxy agents for evaluating human-AI coordination in Hanabi, offering a limited dataset and baseline results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving seamless human-AI coordination is crucial but challenging, and Hanabi is a suitable testbed. Human evaluation is costly and difficult to reproduce.

Method: The paper develops human proxy agents based on a large-scale human dataset.

Result: The paper presents baseline results for two- and three-player Hanabi scenarios using the developed human proxy agents. The proxy agents are hosted through a controlled evaluation system.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) with human proxy agents for evaluating human-AI coordination in Hanabi, providing a limited dataset and baseline results.

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

TL;DR: PsyLite是一个轻量级的心理咨询大语言模型智能体，它提高了心理咨询能力和安全性，同时降低了硬件部署要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在对话安全、详细场景处理和轻量级部署方面存在不足。

Method: 基于InternLM2.5-7B-chat，采用两阶段训练策略（混合蒸馏数据微调和ORPO偏好优化），并设计了条件RAG。

Result: PsyLite在CEval、CPsyCounE和SafeDialBench上优于基线模型，CPsyCounE得分提高了47.6%，对话安全性提高了2.4%，并且仅需5GB内存即可运行。

Conclusion: PsyLite在心理咨询专业性和对话安全性方面优于基线模型，并通过量化技术实现了低硬件部署。

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The study of the evolving phenomena in a domain helps to understand the
relationships between entities at different points in time and predict future
trends. These phenomena, often complex, can be represented using knowledge
graphs, which have the capability to model heterogeneous data from multiple
sources. Nowadays, a considerable amount of sources delivering periodic updates
to knowledge graphs in various domains is openly available. The evolution of
data is of interest to knowledge graph management systems, and therefore it is
crucial to organize these constantly evolving data to make them easily

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of limited metadata in movie recommendation systems.

Method: The paper introduces a pipeline combining LLM-generated plot descriptions and trailer-derived visual embeddings, using data augmentation and fusion strategies like PCA and CCA.

Result: CCA-based fusion significantly boosts recall, and LLM-driven re-ranking further improves NDCG.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that CCA-based fusion boosts recall and LLM-driven re-ranking improves NDCG, especially with limited textual data. The framework is released for further research.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of developing multimodal recommender
systems for the movie domain, where limited metadata (e.g., title, genre) often
hinders the generation of robust recommendations. We introduce a resource that
combines LLM-generated plot descriptions with trailer-derived visual embeddings
in a unified pipeline supporting both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
collaborative filtering. Central to our approach is a data augmentation step
that transforms sparse metadata into richer textual signals, alongside fusion
strategies (e.g., PCA, CCA) that integrate visual cues. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that CCA-based fusion significantly boosts recall
compared to unimodal baselines, while an LLM-driven re-ranking step further
improves NDCG, particularly in scenarios with limited textual data. By
releasing this framework, we invite further exploration of multi-modal
recommendation techniques tailored to cold-start, novelty-focused, and
domain-specific settings. All code, data, and detailed documentation are

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking aims to determine the veracity of scientific claims
by retrieving and analysing evidence from research literature. The problem is
inherently more complex than general fact-checking since it must accommodate
the evolving nature of scientific knowledge, the structural complexity of
academic literature and the challenges posed by long-form, multimodal
scientific expression. However, existing approaches focus on simplified
versions of the problem based on small-scale datasets consisting of abstracts
rather than full papers, thereby avoiding the distinct challenges associated
with processing complete documents. This paper examines the limitations of
current scientific fact-checking systems and reveals the many potential
features and resources that could be exploited to advance their performance. It
identifies key research challenges within evidence retrieval, including (1)

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于双阶段排序的联合 CLTR 估计器和学习方法，该方法可以同时训练候选策略和排序策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 CLTR 方法假设一个单一的排序策略，从整个文档候选集中选择前 K 个排名，这在数百万文档的实际应用中是不切实际的。现有的双阶段离线排序系统的 CLTR 方法只考虑了 top-1 排序设置，并且只专注于训练候选生成器，而排序器是固定的。现有的文献中缺少一种用于联合训练排序器和候选生成器的 CLTR 方法。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的联合优化方法来分别训练候选策略和排序策略。

Result: 在半合成基准上的实验结果表明，所提出的联合 CLTR 方法优于基线。

Conclusion: 提出了一个双阶段 CLTR 估计器和学习方法，用于双阶段排序。

Abstract: Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) aims to learn a ranking policy from
user interactions while correcting for the inherent biases in interaction data,
such as position bias. Existing CLTR methods assume a single ranking policy
that selects top-K ranking from the entire document candidate set. In
real-world applications, the candidate document set is on the order of
millions, making a single-stage ranking policy impractical. In order to scale
to millions of documents, real-world ranking systems are designed in a
two-stage fashion, with a candidate generator followed by a ranker. The
existing CLTR method for a two-stage offline ranking system only considers the
top-1 ranking set-up and only focuses on training the candidate generator, with
the ranker fixed. A CLTR method for training both the ranker and candidate
generator jointly is missing from the existing literature. In this paper, we
propose a two-stage CLTR estimator that considers the interaction between the
two stages and estimates the joint value of the two policies offline. In
addition, we propose a novel joint optimization method to train the candidate
and ranker policies, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to propose a CLTR estimator and learning method for two-stage ranking.
Experimental results on a semi-synthetic benchmark demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed joint CLTR method over baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常假设一个静态语料库，每当有新文档到达时，都需要昂贵的完整图重建，从而限制了它们在动态、不断发展的环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 利用基于超平面的局部敏感哈希（LSH）将原始语料库划分并组织成层次图结构，从而实现对新数据的高效和局部插入，而不会破坏现有拓扑。

Result: EraRag在大型基准测试中实现了比现有Graph-RAG系统高达一个数量级的更新时间和token消耗的降低，同时提供了卓越的准确性表现。

Conclusion: EraRag大幅减少了更新时间和token消耗，同时提供了卓越的准确性表现。

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) enhances large
language models (LLMs) by structuring retrieval over an external corpus.
However, existing approaches typically assume a static corpus, requiring
expensive full-graph reconstruction whenever new documents arrive, limiting
their scalability in dynamic, evolving environments. To address these
limitations, we introduce EraRAG, a novel multi-layered Graph-RAG framework
that supports efficient and scalable dynamic updates. Our method leverages
hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to partition and organize the
original corpus into hierarchical graph structures, enabling efficient and
localized insertions of new data without disrupting the existing topology. The
design eliminates the need for retraining or costly recomputation while
preserving high retrieval accuracy and low latency. Experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that EraRag achieves up to an order of magnitude
reduction in update time and token consumption compared to existing Graph-RAG
systems, while providing superior accuracy performance. This work offers a
practical path forward for RAG systems that must operate over continually
growing corpora, bridging the gap between retrieval efficiency and
adaptability. Our code and data are available at

Motivation: Existing research on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) primarily focuses on improving overall question-answering accuracy, often overlooking the quality of sub-claims within generated responses. Recent methods lack probabilistic guarantees or require ground truth answers.

Method: Conformal-RAG, a novel framework inspired by conformal prediction (CP) on large language models (LLMs), leverages CP and internal information from the RAG mechanism to offer statistical guarantees on response quality.

Conclusion: Conformal-RAG offers statistical guarantees on the quality of refined sub-claims, ensuring response reliability without the need for ground truth answers, and retains up to 60% more high-quality sub-claims compared to direct applications of CP to LLMs.

Abstract: Existing research on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) primarily focuses
on improving overall question-answering accuracy, often overlooking the quality
of sub-claims within generated responses. Recent methods that attempt to
improve RAG trustworthiness, such as through auto-evaluation metrics, lack

Conformal-RAG leverages CP and internal information from the RAG mechanism to

coverage spanning multiple sub-domains without requiring manual labelling of
conformal sets, making it suitable for complex RAG applications. Compared to
existing RAG auto-evaluation methods, Conformal-RAG offers statistical

TL;DR: 推荐系统侧重于行为共现信号，而不是项目内容，导致难以理解用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实世界的应用中，用户总是通过多个方面与项目互动，例如通过隐式二元反馈（例如，点击、不喜欢、长时间观看）和显式反馈（例如，评论、评论）。

Method: 一些研究试图利用基于内容的评论来捕获语义知识，以增强推荐模型。

Result: 大多数这些方法侧重于预测评论的评级，但不提供人类可理解的解释。

Conclusion: 推荐系统难以理解用户喜欢或不喜欢某些项目的根本原因，因为它们侧重于行为共现信号，而不是项目本身的实际内容。

Abstract: In real-world applications, users always interact with items in multiple
aspects, such as through implicit binary feedback (e.g., clicks, dislikes, long
views) and explicit feedback (e.g., comments, reviews). Modern recommendation
systems (RecSys) learn user-item collaborative signals from these implicit
feedback signals as a large-scale binary data-streaming, subsequently
recommending other highly similar items based on users' personalized historical
interactions. However, from this collaborative-connection perspective, the
RecSys does not focus on the actual content of the items themselves but instead
prioritizes higher-probability signals of behavioral co-occurrence among items.
Consequently, under this binary learning paradigm, the RecSys struggles to
understand why a user likes or dislikes certain items. To alleviate it, some
works attempt to utilize the content-based reviews to capture the semantic
knowledge to enhance recommender models. However, most of these methods focus
on predicting the ratings of reviews, but do not provide a human-understandable
explanation.

Motivation: 现有的联邦学习方法主要关注模型异构性和聚合技术，而忽略了数据集大小特征对联邦训练动态的根本影响。

Method: 引入了一种新的基于大小的自适应联邦学习（SAFL）渐进式训练框架，该框架基于跨异构多模态数据集的数据集大小特征系统地组织联邦学习。

Result: 1) 联邦学习有效性的最佳数据集大小范围为1000-1500个样本；2) 具有结构化数据（时间序列、传感器）的清晰模态性能层级明显优于非结构化数据（文本、多模态）；3) 大于2000个样本的大型数据集的系统性能下降。

Conclusion: SAFL框架在所有数据集上实现了87.68%的平均准确率，结构化数据模态的准确率达到99%以上。该框架展示了卓越的通信效率，在保持高性能的同时，将558次通信的总数据传输量减少到7.38 GB。我们的实时监控框架为系统资源利用率、网络效率和训练动态提供了前所未有的见解。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing
approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation
techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size
characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces
Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training
framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset
size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive
experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities
(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)
reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500
samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance
hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly
outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic
performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL
achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured
data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior
communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558
communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring
framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization,
network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in
understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning
strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for
real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

Conclusion: E-ABIN effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers insights into disease mechanisms in case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease.

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a computational framework based on the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), which posits that inference under uncertainty relies on aligning high-entropy contexts with low-entropy content. The framework identifies four layers of operational principles and demonstrates their effectiveness through simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with low-entropy, structured content.

Method: develop a layered computational framework that derives operational principles from this foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four hierarchical layers of operational principles

Result: We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of CCUP-aligned inference.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric
inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,
all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation
Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,
and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping
Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;
and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates
these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and
planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among
principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of
CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for
understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive

*Vineet Jain,Kusha Sareen,Mohammad Pedramfar,Siamak Ravanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS) and Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$\star$) to improve inference-time alignment of diffusion models by reusing past computations, achieving better sample quality with less compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing steering methods for adapting pretrained diffusion models to new objectives at inference time suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, and do not reuse information from past runs, resulting in inefficient use of compute.

Method: Introduce a tree-based approach (Diffusion Tree Sampling) that samples from the reward-aligned target density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. A greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$\star$), performs a global search for high reward samples.

Result: DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to 10x less compute on MNIST and CIFAR-10. DTS$\star$ effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to 5x less compute in text-to-image generation and language completion tasks.

Conclusion: Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS) produces asymptotically exact samples and Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$\star$) performs a global search for high reward samples, achieving better FID scores with less compute in image generation and effectively searching for high reward samples in text-to-image and language completion tasks.

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time
remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods
suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which
biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve
sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the
success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting
inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We
introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target
density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and
iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our
proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact
samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its
greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search
for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,
DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less
compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$
effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to
$5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we
get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better
samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of
diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proves the correctness of FLIPD, a state-of-the-art LID estimator, under realistic assumptions and extends the result to uniform convolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are performant generative models and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete since it was only proved its correctness under the highly unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds.

Method: Linking the LID to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to the amount of added noise.

Result: Proved the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions. Showed that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones.

Conclusion: Formally proves the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions, and shows an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional
ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional
submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with
progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this
process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,
and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.
For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively
expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic
dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari
et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID
to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to
the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID
estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify
the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,
adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art
performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete
since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly
unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap
by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.
Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions
are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex
reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with
comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced

the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on
AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,

empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical
problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials

systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models,
which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs

Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous
experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration
of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation

*Todd Nief,David Reber,Sean Richardson,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs extract and recall relation information, with pathways involving specific layers and mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing localization approaches are ill-suited for analyzing where relation information goes in LLMs during finetuning because they tend to delete information.

Method: Dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained language models

Result: Relation information is extracted during entity processing and recalled in later layers. Necessity and sufficiency of these pathways were examined, identifying layers, redundancy, and model components involved. The recall pathway involves task-specific attention and relation extraction in the output of attention and feedforward networks at the final layers.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned language models extract and recall relation information. Both pathways are sometimes needed for correct generation, but sometimes one is sufficient. The recall pathway uses task-specific attention and relation extraction in the final layers.

Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases,
corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when
the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or
are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g.
activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to
replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill
this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained
language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract
relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and
(2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In
some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned
information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway
alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these
information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy
they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the
``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a
relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward
networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

TL;DR: 研究了在模型训练期间块缩放精度格式的挑战和可行性，发现 MX 格式的训练表现出急剧的随机不稳定性，并提出了一种简单的模型，其中层归一化仿射参数量化引入的乘法梯度偏差和一小部分激活可以触发失控发散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型是一个昂贵的、受计算限制的过程，必须随着模型规模的扩大、算法的改进和新数据的收集而重复进行。为了解决这个问题，下一代硬件加速器越来越多地支持低精度算术格式，例如 NVIDIA Blackwell 架构中引入的 Microscaling (MX) 格式。

Method: 通过在较小的代理模型上进行受控实验和消融研究，并扫描架构设置、超参数和精度格式，来解释这种现象。通过对代理模型进行原位干预实验，证明可以通过修改训练中的精度方案来避免或延迟不稳定性。在 LLM 设置中评估稳定策略，并表明某些混合配置可以恢复与全精度训练相媲美的性能。

Result: 在从头开始训练的近一千个语言模型中，跨越从 2 x 10^17 到 4.8 x 10^19 FLOPs 的计算预算，并扫描各种权重激活精度组合，一致观察到以 MX 格式训练在损失中表现出急剧的随机不稳定性，尤其是在更大的计算规模下。

Conclusion: 通过在训练过程中修改精度方案，可以避免或延迟不稳定性。某些混合配置可以恢复与全精度训练相当的性能。

Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that
must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is
collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly
support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)
formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a
shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and
perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency
gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of
block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one
thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from
$2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad
range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe
that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the
loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we
conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that
exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural
settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a
simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the
quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of
activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention
experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be
averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these
findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that
certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with
full-precision training. We release our code at

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning
stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear
dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key
challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear
scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively
expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure
modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale
phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in
regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of
diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure
modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical
applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this
limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional
diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the
dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical
characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach
helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small
reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model
in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed
stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves
significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive
accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD), a scalable and robust method for decomposing neural networks, overcoming limitations of Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APD is impractical due to computational cost and hyperparameter sensitivity.

Method: Introduction of Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD).

Result: SPD avoids shrinkage, better identifies ground truth mechanisms, and enables decomposition of larger, more complex models.

Conclusion: Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) is more scalable and robust than Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD).

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into
simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter
decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues
with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into
a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main
method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is
impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter
Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to
hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are
slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We
also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned
parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By
bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this
demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic
interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition
methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing
our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for
time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction.
However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time
deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising
platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target
feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom
implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the
open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment
of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open
Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of
LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and
functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom
transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation
graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and
Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM
model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and
generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting
the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator
through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource
consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of
state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the
generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for
resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

Motivation: 大多数分布式 GNN 框架和系统都针对节点分类进行了优化。它们在链接预测方面的性能仍未得到充分探索。本文旨在揭示 GNN 在链接预测中分布式训练的性能下降问题，当每个 worker 在其分配的分区子图上训练 GNN 时，在无法访问整个图的情况下，性能会下降。

Method: 提出 SpLPG，它有效地利用图稀疏化来缓解性能下降的问题，同时降低了通信成本。

Result: 发现性能下降的主要来源不仅来自图划分导致的信息丢失，还来自模型训练期间抽取负样本的方式。虽然与每个 worker 共享完整的图信息可以解决该问题并保持链接预测的准确性，但会产生高昂的通信成本。

Conclusion: SpLPG 通过图稀疏化有效缓解了性能下降的问题，同时降低了通信成本，在多个公共真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明了 SpLPG 的有效性，它可以减少高达 80% 的通信开销，同时在很大程度上保持链接预测的准确性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related
problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of
GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node
classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored.
This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by
investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a
GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire
graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the
information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing
negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph
information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction
accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which
effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance
degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several
public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which
reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving
link prediction accuracy.

on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the
previously detected targets. We formulate this as a multi-objective
optimization problem and employ deep reinforcement learning to find
Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC
showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further
employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of
the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more
efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple
competing objectives in dynamic environments.

*Fei Wang,Baochun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA fine-tuning reduces memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while maintaining strong task performance. Model scale and data duplication do not follow the same trend in LoRA fine-tuning as in pre-training and full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While pre-training memorization has been extensively studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.

Method: a more relaxed similarity-based memorization metric

Result: Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the same trend in LoRA fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LoRA significantly reduces memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong task performance.

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) has
revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling models with unprecedented

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的输出重加权反学习方法 RWFT，该方法可以有效地从训练好的分类器中删除整个类别，同时减轻有害或有偏见的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从训练好的模型中忘记特定类别对于执行用户删除权和减轻有害或有偏见的预测至关重要。完全重新训练成本高昂，并且现有的反学习方法在预测来自未学习类别的样本时，无法复制重新训练模型的行为。

Method: 提出了一种输出重加权的反学习方法 RWFT，这是一种轻量级技术，可以在不完全重新训练的情况下从训练好的分类器中删除整个类别。

Result: 证明了现有反学习方法的失败，通过设计了一种成员推理攻击的变体 MIA-NN，该变体成功地揭示了这些方法的未学习类别。提出了一种简单的概率质量重新分配方法，用于预测被遗忘类别中的样本，该方法对 MIA-NN 具有鲁棒性。引入了一种新的基于预测概率的总变异 (TV) 距离的指标，以量化残余泄漏，以防止未来的方法容易受到新的攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法在先前工作中使用的评估指标和我们在这项工作中提出的新指标上，与完全重新训练的结果相匹配。与最先进的方法相比，我们在先前使用的指标上获得了 2.79% 的提升，在我们新的基于 TV 的指标上，比现有最佳方法提升了 111.45%。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

*Erfan Hajihashemi,Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模型在线共形预测算法，该算法通过二部图反馈选择有效模型子集，从而减小预测集大小并降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对潜在的分布偏移，引入了多模型在线共形预测，以从预选的候选集中选择和利用不同的模型。候选集的选择也带来了挑战：大量模型会增加计算复杂性，包含不相关的模型可能会对性能产生负面影响，并导致不必要的大预测集。

Method: 提出了一种新的多模型在线共形预测算法，该算法通过从二部图中收集反馈来识别每个时间步的有效模型子集，并在接收到新数据后进行细化。然后从该子集中选择一个模型来构建预测集。

Result: 使用预测集大小作为反馈，以及模型损失，可以通过构建更小的预测集来显着提高效率，同时仍满足所需的覆盖保证。所提出的算法被证明可以确保有效的覆盖率并实现次线性后悔。

Conclusion: 提出的算法通过构建更小的预测集，优于现有的多模型在线共形预测方法，并在真实和合成数据集上验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a
prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a
predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,
multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and
leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the
improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.
A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the
computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with
poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to
unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a
subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a
bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then
selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced
computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we
demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,
can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets
while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms
are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments
on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct
smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal
prediction approaches.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了平均奖励 MDP 中的离线强化学习，并为单策略样本复杂度提供了理论保证，同时提出了新的算法和技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平均奖励 MDP 中的离线强化学习带来了来自分布偏移和非均匀覆盖的挑战，并且从理论角度来看，对此研究相对不足。

Method: 该论文提出了一个基于悲观折扣值迭代的算法，该算法通过一种新的分位数剪裁技术得到增强，这使得使用更清晰的基于经验跨度的惩罚函数成为可能。

Result: 该论文获得了仅取决于目标策略的精确保证，特别是偏差跨度和一种新的策略命中半径，从而为平均奖励离线 RL 提供了第一个完全单策略样本复杂度边界。该论文还首次处理了一般的弱通信 MDP。通过硬性例子表明，在论文的条件下进行学习需要超出目标策略的平稳分布的覆盖假设，从而将单策略复杂度度量与先前检查的案例区分开来。论文还开发了几乎与主要结果相匹配的下限。

Conclusion: 这篇论文发展了平均奖励离线强化学习的单策略样本复杂度边界，并处理了一般的弱通信 MDP。

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which
presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and
non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical
perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under
single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional
complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform
mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy,
specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the
first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline
RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs,
contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve
this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration
enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a
sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not
require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we
show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage
assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy,
distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined
cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

Motivation: 神经网络的一个显著局限性是它们的“黑盒”性质，最近的研究工作越来越集中在可解释的AI（XAI）技术上，以描述神经网络决策背后的基本原理。LIME方法中的抽样过程忽略了特征之间的相关性。

Method: 提出了一种改进的LIME方法，该方法将深度学习（DL）集成到抽样过程中，称为DL-LIME。在雷达资源管理的深度强化学习中采用了DL-LIME。

Result: 数值结果表明，DL-LIME在保真度和任务性能方面优于传统LIME，在两个指标上都表现出卓越的性能。

Conclusion: DL-LIME在保真度和任务性能方面优于传统LIME，在雷达资源管理决策中，DL-LIME 提供了关于哪些因素更重要的见解。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making
processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional
approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM).
However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature
and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI)
techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One
promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between
features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates
deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We
employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource
management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME
in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior
performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors
are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an LLM multi-agent framework that autonomously infers operating constraints and collaboratively guides optimization, achieving competitive performance and better computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods become impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable, requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, this paper presents a novel approach.

Method: A multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints.

Result: The framework demonstrated competitive performance with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge and achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. The framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs, and applying domain-informed heuristics.

Conclusion: The LLM multi-agent framework demonstrates competitive performance with conventional optimization methods, better computational efficiency, and sophisticated process understanding, showing significant potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable.

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends classical rule ensembles by introducing logical propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables, enabling decision regions as general polytopes with oblique faces. The proposed method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical rule ensembles rely on having access to a curated set of expressive and ideally independent input features. Absent such features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the model.

Method: a learning method using sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation of logistic regression.

Result: Introducing logical propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables enables decision regions as general polytopes with oblique faces.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across ten benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction
models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on
conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input
variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel
polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of
interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the
gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of
expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of
axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such
features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and
complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the
model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical
propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,
i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where
$\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as
general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using
sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation
of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as
state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across
ten benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 通过完全重新训练来消除这些有问题的datapoint的影响——通过在排除这些特定实例的数据集上重复预训练模型——在计算上是令人望而却步的。因此，出现了卸载算法，旨在消除特定数据点的影响，同时以较低的计算成本保留模型。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的算法 MSA，用于估计和消除数据点的影响——通过利用模型检查点，即捕获预训练不同阶段的模型状态的工件。

Result: MSA在多个基准测试、模型和评估指标上始终优于现有的机器卸载算法

Conclusion: MSA在多个基准测试、模型和评估指标上始终优于现有的机器卸载算法，这表明 MSA 可能是实现能够进行数据擦除的更灵活的大型语言模型的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may
include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data
that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic
datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model
on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally
prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to
eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving
the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and
undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In
this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the
influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts
capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine
unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation
metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more
flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

Conclusion: AbMEGD在抗体序列和结构协同设计方面表现出色，并在关键CDR-H3区域的氨基酸恢复率、改进百分比和均方根偏差方面优于DiffAb。

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark
for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合锐度感知零阶优化 (SharpZO) 方法，用于增强 ZO VLM 微调的性能，该方法优于现有的仅正向方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调视觉语言模型 (VLM) 在各种下游任务中取得了显著的性能；然而，它需要通过反向传播 (BP) 访问模型梯度，这使得它们不适合内存受限的纯推理边缘设备。为了解决这个限制，之前的工作已经探索了各种无 BP 微调方法。然而，这些方法通常依赖于高方差进化策略 (ES) 或零阶 (ZO) 优化，并且常常无法获得令人满意的性能。

Method: 混合锐度感知零阶优化 (SharpZO) 方法，通过锐度感知热身训练来增强 ZO VLM 微调的性能。SharpZO 具有两阶段优化过程：锐度感知 ES 阶段，全局探索和平滑损失，以构建强大的初始化；然后是通过稀疏 ZO 优化进行细粒度的局部搜索。整个优化仅依赖于前向传递。

Result: SharpZO 显著提高了准确性和收敛速度，与最先进的仅正向方法相比，平均增益高达 7%。

Conclusion: SharpZO显著提高了准确性和收敛速度，与最先进的仅正向方法相比，平均增益高达 7%。

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally
explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization,
followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire
optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly
improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over
state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for
generative models because of their ability to better model probability
distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to
their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable
inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply
interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability
distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more
difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective
functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In
this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase
sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.
We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional
Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these
architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a
non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that
knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,
we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance
gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a
proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of
bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

Conclusion: TRIDENT在11个下游任务上实现了最先进的性能，证明了结合SMILES、文本和分类功能注释对分子性质预测的价值。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical
structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely
overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation
learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular
SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn
rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive
dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional
annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT
employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features
at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities.
Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that
captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their
corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically
balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad

TL;DR: MoRA通过使用自激活和稀疏等级激活来改进持续学习，从而减轻遗忘并提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LoRA的混合专家(MoE)方法通过分配和冻结特定于任务的适配器来减轻遗忘，但由于粗糙的适配器级别选择而遭受干扰、冗余和模糊的路由。

Method: MoRA，一种混合等级自适应学习方法，具有自激活和稀疏等级激活功能。

Result: MoRA在具有CLIP和大型语言模型(llm)的持续学习任务上进行了验证，分析了微调期间的领域内学习和领域外遗忘/泛化。

Conclusion: MoRA通过增强PTM的CL，提高泛化能力，同时减轻遗忘，从而在持续学习任务中表现出显著的有效性。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by
catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and
freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and
ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design
introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts
per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful
components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or
contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks
and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features
across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As
more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating
forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with
self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple
low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,
each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1
expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid
ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own
relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning
and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per
input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large
language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain
forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant
effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while
mitigating forgetting.

Conclusion: 该方法在适应联邦学习中的概念漂移方面表现出有效性，并且始终优于现有的三种模式的方法，实验结果与理论结果相符，证实了漂移模式会显着影响性能。

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world

TL;DR: SSE是一种图结构分层强化学习框架，通过强制执行单步子目标可达性、解耦探索策略和失败感知路径细化来提高长程目标条件任务的效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长程目标条件任务对强化学习（RL）提出了根本性的挑战，特别是当目标遥远且奖励稀疏时。虽然分层和基于图的方法提供了部分解决方案，但它们经常遭受子目标不可行和低效规划的困扰。

Method: 一种基于图的分层RL框架，通过结构性地约束高层决策来执行单步子目标可达性。为了加强探索，SSE采用了一种解耦的探索策略，该策略系统地遍历目标空间中未充分探索的区域。此外，一种失败感知路径细化，通过根据观察到的低级别成功率动态调整边缘成本来细化基于图的规划，从而提高子目标的可靠性。

Conclusion: SSE在各种长程基准测试中始终优于现有的目标条件RL和分层RL方法，无论是在效率还是成功率方面。

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards
are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions,
they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We
introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL
framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally
constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a
decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored
regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which
refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to
observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability.
Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that
SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL
approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和多样性方面均优于基线方法。在高维环境中，与现有方法相比，该方法实现了 15% 的零样本改进。

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable
behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they
focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information
optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform
well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for
the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a
min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware
method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered
skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight
behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the
policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored
while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an
implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and
guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid
degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill
generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities
and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15%
zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDAA is proposed to address the challenge of multi-source concept drift in federated learning by distinguishing and adapting to different drift sources while retaining useful historical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily focus on real drift and often fail when clients experience virtual or label drift, leading to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies.

Method: FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework integrating a cluster number determination module, a real drift detection module, and a concept drift adaptation module.

Result: FedDAA adapts to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable historical knowledge, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change
over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as
concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift
(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the
input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution
P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily
focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these
methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading
to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different
sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift
calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from
retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a
general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To
address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework
designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable
historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster
number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real
drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and
a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful
historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and
experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of
LLMs.

Conclusion: 该论文旨在通过提供一个用于评估公平联邦学习方法的基准测试框架，以支持更强大和可重复的公平性研究。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key
concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated
system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that
are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing
solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a
single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and
sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited
perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the
different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in
FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at
both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:
(1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to
evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four
bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness
mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use
functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

Motivation: Current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via black-box neural networks.

Method: H-CMR models relationships between concepts using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task.

Conclusion: H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is available.

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide
interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These
models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task.
However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task
prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via
black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for
both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts
using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that
define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a

applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental
results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态跳过Transformer中间层的新架构，但实验结果表明，与密集基线相比，该方法没有带来性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有条件的计算是使Transformer更有效的流行策略。现有的方法通常针对单个模块（例如，混合专家层）或彼此独立地跳过层。然而，可解释性研究表明，Transformer的中间层表现出更大的冗余，并且早期层将信息聚合到token位置。

Method: 一种新颖的架构，可以动态地从中间向外跳过可变数量的层。具体来说，一种学习的门控机制确定是否基于输入绕过对称的中央块跨度，并且门控注意力机制阻止后续token关注跳过的token位置。残余范数通过“sandwich”或“perilayernorm”方案控制，门稀疏性通过自适应正则化损失控制。

Result: 减少“更简单”token的计算需求，并可能促进涌现的多层次表示层次结构，但在所研究的范围内，该方法在验证交叉熵和估计的 FLOP 之间的权衡方面没有实现改进。

Conclusion: 在所研究的范围内，与层数较少的密集基线相比，该方法在验证交叉熵和估计的 FLOP 之间的权衡方面没有实现改进。

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Unlasting模型，用于解决单细胞扰动数据中的配对问题，并引入了新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 估计各种扰动下的单细胞反应有助于识别关键基因并增强药物筛选，从而显着提高实验效率。 然而，单细胞测序是一个破坏性过程，无法捕获相同细胞在扰动前后的表型。 因此，在扰动和非扰动条件下收集的数据本质上是不成对的。 现有方法要么试图使用随机抽样强制配对不成对的数据，要么在建模过程中忽略非扰动细胞和扰动细胞之间的内在关系。

Method: 基于双重扩散隐式桥(DDIB)的框架来学习不同数据分布之间的映射

Result: 集成了基因调控网络(GRN)信息，以在生物学上有意义的方式传播扰动信号，并进一步结合掩蔽机制来预测沉默基因，从而提高生成的谱图的质量。 此外，同一扰动下的基因表达通常在细胞之间差异很大，经常表现出反映内在异质性的双峰分布。

Conclusion: 提出了Unlasting，一种双重条件扩散模型，可以克服非配对单细胞扰动数据的问题，并在GRN的指导下加强模型对扰动的洞察力，以及一个专门的掩码模型，旨在通过预测沉默基因来提高生成质量。 此外，我们引入了一种生物学基础的评估指标，可以更好地反映单细胞反应中固有的异质性。

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

TL;DR: 提出了一种反脆弱RL框架，通过结合基于贴现汤普森抽样（DTS）的切换机制，增强了对更广泛分布漂移的适应性，从而动态选择多种鲁棒策略，以最大限度地减少对抗引起的state-action-value分布漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人驾驶飞行器（UAV）导航自动化程度的提高，使它们容易受到利用传感器操纵来利用强化学习（RL）漏洞的对抗性攻击。虽然现有的鲁棒性RL方法旨在减轻此类威胁，但由于它们主要用于处理固定的扰动，因此其有效性已限制了对最佳价值分布的分布外转移的概括。

Method: 通过结合基于贴现汤普森抽样（DTS）的切换机制，引入了一种反脆弱RL框架，该框架通过动态选择多个鲁棒策略来最小化对抗引起的state-action-value分布漂移，从而增强了对更广泛分布漂移的适应性。

Result: 优化DTS以最小化由于分布漂移造成的总体遗憾，从而有效地适应看不见的对抗性攻击，从而诱导反脆弱性。

Conclusion: 与传统的鲁棒非自适应RL方法相比，该反脆弱方法取得了优异的性能，在复杂导航环境中，与现有的鲁棒RL技术相比，展示了更短的导航路径长度和更高的无冲突导航轨迹率，通过大量的数值模拟验证了所提出的框架在具有多个动态三维障碍物以及更强的投影梯度下降（PGD）和欺骗攻击的复杂导航环境中的有效性。

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative
reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the
practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for
secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的 Norm-Aware 线性注意力机制，旨在恢复范数引导的动态 Spikiness 并恢复核扰动范数分布，从而提高视觉和语言任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了保留softmax的两个基本属性，非负性和熵减少，目前的工作采用各种线性可分离的核函数与$L1$归一化代替softmax算子。然而，查询范数被线性注意中的归一化操作忽略，这种退化严重导致熵差距。同时，现有的工作抑制查询和键向量的负值，导致在映射后缺少内积交互。

Method: 提出了一种新的范数感知线性注意力机制，用于恢复范数引导的动态尖峰和恢复核扰动的范数分布。具体来说，首先将查询和键矩阵解耦为两个分量：范数和方向，以分别实现范数感知尖峰控制和范数一致性。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了NaLaFormer在视觉和语言任务上的性能，在表达性和效率上提高了4.2%。

Conclusion: NaLaFormer在视觉和语言任务上提高了性能，在表达性和效率上提高了4.2%。

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by
reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve
two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,
current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$
normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected
by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily
leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of
query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after
being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware
Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and
recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple
query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve
norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We
mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the
query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel
function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure
norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a
norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into
positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with
opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the
NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both
expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

Motivation: 通用大型语言模型(llm)通常通过有监督的微调(SFT)来提高特定领域的性能。通过提取更大的模型的思维链可以获得更好的结果，但这需要大量的昂贵调用和更多的数据。

Method: 该论文通过token answer entropy将训练数据分成不同的复杂程度，然后使用有监督微调和知识蒸馏来微调大型语言模型。

Result: 该论文提出的方法在两个小型开放模型上，显著优于标准SFT方法(平均准确率0.55 vs 0.43)，并提供了与知识蒸馏相当的性能，同时使用的数据量减少了62%(两种方法的平均准确率均为0.55)。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种高效的微调方案，可以在减少数据量的情况下，达到与知识蒸馏相当的性能。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

Motivation: 现有的脑电解码方法难以捕捉长程时间依赖和全局通道间关系，且局部和全局特征集成不佳，忽略了显式的通道建模。

Method: 提出DBConformer，一个双分支卷积Transformer网络，集成了时间Conformer和空间Conformer，并使用通道注意力模块。

Result: DBConformer在五个运动想象数据集和两个癫痫检测数据集上，在三种评估设置下，始终优于10个竞争基线模型，参数比高容量的脑电Conformer基线模型少八倍以上。

Conclusion: DBConformer在运动想象和癫痫检测数据集上表现优于其他模型，且参数更少，特征具有生理可解释性，适用于鲁棒和可解释的脑电解码。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform
spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external
communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream
backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it
difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel
relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address
this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration
of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch
convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a
temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial
Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal
dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention
module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven
importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)
datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings
demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline
models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG
Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the
features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned
with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability
of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code

Motivation: Distributed training of large language models (LLMs) requires high communication and is dependent on centralized clusters. The paper explores training on slow networks to enable decentralized clusters for models exceeding 100 billion parameters.

Method: DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale decentralized cluster training framework, combines Pipeline Parallelism with Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme.

Result: DiLoCoX achieves a 357x speedup in distributed training compared to vanilla AllReduce while maintaining negligible degradation in model convergence when pre-training a 107B model over a 1Gbps network.

Conclusion: DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model over a 1Gbps network, achieving a 357x speedup compared to vanilla AllReduce with negligible degradation in model convergence.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100
billion parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法通常无法识别新型威胁，并且传统的 OOD 检测器难以区分隐秘的对抗攻击与真实的 OOD 事件，因此需要有弹性和智能的入侵检测系统 (IDS)。

Method: 基于条件生成对抗网络 (cGAN) 的框架，用于制作逃避 IDS 机制的隐秘对抗攻击。利用条件变分自编码器 (CVAE) 和负对数似然来区分对抗输入和真实的 OOD 样本。

Result: CVAE-based 后悔分数在识别隐秘对抗威胁方面明显优于传统的基于马氏距离的检测器。

Conclusion: 高级概率建模对于加强IDS抵御基于自适应生成模型的网络入侵的能力至关重要。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Motivation: 联邦学习 (FL) 可以在不共享本地数据的情况下实现跨分散客户端的协作模型训练，但面临数据、计算和通信方面的异构性挑战。预训练的视觉语言模型 (VLM) 具有强大的泛化能力和通过提示进行轻量级调整，提供了一种有前途的解决方案。然而，现有的联邦提示学习方法仅依赖于文本提示，而忽略了联合标签域分布偏移。

Method: 提出了一种基于双提示学习和交叉融合的个性化联邦学习框架pFedDC。

Result: 每个客户端维护跨视觉和语言模态的全局和本地提示：全局提示捕获联邦共享的通用知识，而本地提示编码客户端特定的语义和域特征。同时，交叉融合模块旨在自适应地整合来自不同级别的提示，使模型能够生成与每个客户端的独特数据分布对齐的个性化表示。

Conclusion: pFedDC在九个具有各种异质性的数据集上始终优于最先进的方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: Current MoE systems suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is consistently activated, leading to underutilization.

Method: Latent Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization.

Result: LPR reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average, improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving near-perfect load balancing.

Conclusion: LPR achieves near-perfect load balancing, reducing Gini coefficient from 0.70 to 0.035 and improving min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

Motivation: 为了增强现有的优化解决方案，提出基于线性度的压缩方法作为减少神经网络中权重的新方法。该方法基于 ReLU 激活函数的神经元几乎总是线性激活的直觉。

Method: 基于线性度的压缩方法，通过合并后续层来减少权重。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络模型压缩提供了一种新途径，实现了更小、更高效的神经网络模型。

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary
parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly
optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel
way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that
with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated
behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the
theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally.
Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original
model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on
already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between
different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful
combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type
of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural
network models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs hallucinate incorrect information and are poorly calibrated, making uncertainty quantification critical, especially in high-stakes domains. Existing Bayesian deep learning approaches struggle to scale to larger LLMs due to requiring additional parameters compared to LoRA.

Method: The paper performs Bayesian inference in a low-dimensional subspace and repurposes LoRA parameters as projection matrices to map samples into the full weight space of the LLM. The parameters are learned using stochastic variational inference.

Result: ScalaBL achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches, requires only ~1000 additional parameters, and scales to the largest Bayesian LLM to date (four times as many base parameters as prior work).

Conclusion: The paper introduces ScalaBL, a scalable Bayesian approach for uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs). It achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while using only ~1000 additional parameters and scaling to larger LLMs than previous approaches.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

Conclusion: 该实验得出结论，所提出的多样化 minibatch 选择框架可以显著提高解决方案的多样性，同时仍然获得高质量的解决方案。在药物发现中，这种结果可能会更快地满足未满足的药物需求。

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making

Motivation: 重新审视k-means聚类和k-GMM的随机播种技术，并将其形式化为三个关键要素：用于种子采样的度量、候选种子的数量和用于种子选择的度量。

Method: 提出了利用lookahead原理和多通道策略的新初始化方法。

Result: 实验表明，与经典算法相比，在最终指标（k-means 的 SSE，k-GMM 的对数似然）方面有持续的常数因子改进，且开销不大。对于 k-means，该方法优于最近设计的多交换策略。实验分析还揭示了 k-means 的细微特性，包括播种时的 SSE 与最终 SSE 之间的（缺乏）相关性、迭代播种方法中观察到的方差减少现象以及贪婪方法中最终 SSE 对池大小的敏感性。

Conclusion: 提出了有效的聚类算法，有望成为标准技术，并为新的分析方法打开了大门。

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM
(Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing
their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of
candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields
novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead
principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the
final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame
down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical
contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for
k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve
on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to
outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means
often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon
seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in
iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool
size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to
become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical
perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems, existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study addresses this gap

Method: introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG representations.

Result: With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference time, and shorter input EEG signal

Conclusion: AGTCNet significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI deployment. AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset, AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and 2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography
(EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals
to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising
potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems
remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability
of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware
constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,
existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate
spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study
addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional
network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)
classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration
of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional
attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG
representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG
classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact
architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI
deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference
time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy
of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV
Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for
subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset,
AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and
2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further
improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

TL;DR: DynamicBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in real-time information processing, outperforming GPT4o in both document-free and document-assisted scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and processing up-to-the-minute data.

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on
static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to
capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in
contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and

pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates
domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within

*Le Vu Anh,Mehmet Dik,Nguyen Viet Anh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文为谱拓扑数据分析提供了第一个特征值水平的鲁棒性保证，确保谱特征在局部更新下保持稳定，并能够在动态数据设置中实现可靠的误差控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究建立了这些算子的全局代数稳定性，但是当添加一个单纯形（例如顶点、边或三角形）时，单个特征值的精确变化仍然未知。这很重要，因为下游工具，包括热核签名和谱神经网络，直接依赖于这些特征值。

Method: 证明了一个均匀 Lipschitz 边界

Result: 在插入一个单纯形后，每个向上持久的拉普拉斯算子特征值最多变化该单纯形边界的欧几里德范数的两倍，独立于过滤尺度和复数大小。

Conclusion: 本文证明了均匀 Lipschitz 边界：插入一个单纯形后，每个向上持久的拉普拉斯算子特征值最多变化该单纯形边界的欧几里德范数的两倍，独立于过滤尺度和复数大小。该结果提供了 spectral topological data analysis 的第一个特征值水平的鲁棒性保证。它保证了谱特征在局部更新下保持稳定，并能够在动态数据设置中实现可靠的误差控制。

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and
structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology,
physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of
geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work
established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change
in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle,
is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools,
including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly
on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound:
after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary
by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of
filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first
eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.
It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and
enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with multimodal in-context learning for medical tasks, showing susceptibility to irrelevant examples and recency bias in example ordering, according to the new SMMILE benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored in medicine, where clinicians need to adapt to diverse tasks from limited examples. The ability of MLLMs to learn multimodal tasks from context is largely unknown.

Method: Introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks, and SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. Evaluate 15 MLLMs on these benchmarks.

Result: Most models exhibit moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. Performance degrades with irrelevant examples, and example ordering exhibits a recency bias.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have limitations and biases in learning multimodal medical tasks from context, as demonstrated by their susceptibility to irrelevant examples and recency bias in example ordering.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite
significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely
encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited
examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or
considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question
answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is
largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL
benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each
including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task
demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer
triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further
introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A
comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit
moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended
evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on
SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant
in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade
performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,
i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial
performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical
limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks
from context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: improving sample efficiency and longer-term training in pixel-based deep reinforcement learning

Method: regularizes Q-value distributions with augmented images via MSE

Result: rQdia achieves gains in sample efficiency and longer-term training, and surpasses the state encoding baseline in model-free continuous control.

Conclusion: rQdia boosts DrQ and SAC on MuJoCo and Data-Efficient Rainbow on Atari.

Abstract: rQdia regularizes Q-value distributions with augmented images in pixel-based
deep reinforcement learning. With a simple auxiliary loss, that equalizes these
distributions via MSE, rQdia boosts DrQ and SAC on 9/12 and 10/12 tasks
respectively in the MuJoCo Continuous Control Suite from pixels, and
Data-Efficient Rainbow on 18/26 Atari Arcade environments. Gains are measured
in both sample efficiency and longer-term training. Moreover, the addition of
rQdia finally propels model-free continuous control from pixels over the state
encoding baseline.

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has
established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine
Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this
paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads
in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher
levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate
multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across
the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and
examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the
CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers
up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the
baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better
accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

TL;DR: NANOADAM updates only the small-magnitude weights during finetuning, leading to better generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large gradients are often associated with small-magnitude weights during finetuning.

Method: NANOADAM dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights during finetuning.

Result: NANOADAM offers several practical advantages: gradient-free parameter subset determination, preservation of large-magnitude weights, and permits the use of larger learning rates.

Conclusion: NANOADAM consistently leads to better generalization performance in experiments for both NLP and vision tasks.

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be
resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate
this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model
parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during
finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated
with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning
settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we
propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights
during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this
criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without
gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are
likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing
the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger
learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in
experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.
