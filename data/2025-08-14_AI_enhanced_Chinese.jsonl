However, synchronizing these two modalities remains a\nsignificant challenge due to temporal and spatial inaccuracies in manually\nrecorded event timestamps.

To address this issue, we propose ELASTIC\n(Event-Location-AgnoSTIC synchronizer), a synchronization framework that only\nuses features derived from tracking data. ELASTIC also explicitly detects the\nend times of pass-like events and separates the detection of major and minor\nevents, which improves the completeness of the synchronized output and reduces\nerror cascade across events.

Recent\nmodel-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply\noptimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading\nto a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This\npaper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL)\ntheory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL\noptimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query\ncollision case.

However, SHAP values are usually treated as point\nestimates, which disregards the inherent and ubiquitous uncertainty in\npredictive models and data. This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric\nand epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise\nin the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In\nthis work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values\ninto aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach\nintegrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via\nDirichlet processes over tree ensembles. We validate the method across three\nreal-world use cases with descriptive statistical analyses that provide insight\ninto the nature of epistemic uncertainty embedded in SHAP explanations. The\nexperimentations enable to provide more comprehensive understanding of the\nreliability and interpretability of SHAP-based attributions. This understanding\ncan guide the development of robust decision-making processes and the\nrefinement of models in high-stakes applications. Through our experiments with\nmultiple datasets, we concluded that features with the highest SHAP values are\nnot necessarily the most stable. This epistemic uncertainty can be reduced\nthrough better, more representative data and following appropriate or\ncase-desired model development techniques.

Most textless SLMs learn to predict the next\nsemantic token, a discrete representation of linguistic content, and rely on a\nseparate vocoder to add acoustic information to the generated speech. Such\nmodels have no access to acoustic context and no built-in control over acoustic\ndetails. In this work, we propose to jointly model linguistic and acoustic\ninformation by generating semantic tokens and a continuous real-valued\nrepresentation of the acoustic frame.

Existing methods either address unobserved\nconfounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback\nbut under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer\neffect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning\nframework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an\ninstrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback\nand unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and\nhigh-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to\ndisentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the\nsimultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct\nvalid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on\nthese IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the\nunobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network\naugmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as\na control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no\nresidual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in\ncapturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances\nthe effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and\nhidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard\nregularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect.\nEmpirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset\ndemonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "DIG2RSI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528I-G\u53d8\u6362\u548c2SRI\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u540c\u4f34\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u534a\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5982\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u540c\u4f34\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u540c\u4f34\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u540c\u6b65\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u540c\u4f34\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6DIG2RSI\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528I-G\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u77e9\u9635\u8fd0\u7b97\uff09\u548c2SRI\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u6216IV\u6280\u672f\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u540c\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u7684\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u540c\u4f34\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6062\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "DIG2RSI\u5728\u534a\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, effectively exploiting\nmultimodal item sequences and mining multi-grained user interests to\nsubstantially bridge the gap between content comprehension and recommendation\nremain challenging. To address these issues, we propose MUFASA, a MUltimodal\nFusion And Sparse Attention-based Alignment model for long sequential\nrecommendation. Our model comprises two core components. First, the Multimodal\nFusion Layer (MFL) leverages item titles as a cross-genre semantic anchor and\nis trained with a joint objective of four tailored losses that promote: (i)\ncross-genre semantic alignment, (ii) alignment to the collaborative space for\nrecommendation, (iii) preserving the similarity structure defined by titles and\npreventing modality representation collapse, and (iv) distributional\nregularization of the fusion space. This yields high-quality fused item\nrepresentations for further preference alignment. Second, the Sparse\nAttention-guided Alignment Layer (SAL) scales to long user-behavior sequences\nvia a multi-granularity sparse attention mechanism, which incorporates windowed\nattention, block-level attention, and selective attention, to capture user\ninterests hierarchically and across temporal horizons.

The chart-to-text task aims to automate this process by\ngenerating textual summaries of charts. While with the rapid advancement of\nlarge Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we have witnessed great progress in this\ndomain, little to no attention has been given to potential biases in their\noutputs. This paper investigates how VLMs can amplify geo-economic biases when\ngenerating chart summaries, potentially causing societal harm. Specifically, we\nconduct a large-scale evaluation of geo-economic biases in VLM-generated chart\nsummaries across 6,000 chart-country pairs from six widely used proprietary and\nopen-source models to understand how a country's economic status influences the\nsentiment of generated summaries. Our analysis reveals that existing VLMs tend\nto produce more positive descriptions for high-income countries compared to\nmiddle- or low-income countries, even when country attribution is the only\nvariable changed.

However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a\nserious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of\nharmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success\nrates, many responses classified as \"successful\" are actually benign, vague, or\nunrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current\nevaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that\nconsiders input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output\nharmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective\njailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:\nhighly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those\nthat are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.\nHowever, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade\nfilters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a\nrecursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).\nThe approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned\nsub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the\ninputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source\nMLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful\noutputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success\nrates by $67\\%$ and harmfulness by $21\\%$, revealing a previously\nunderappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLM \u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56db\u8f74\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5 BSD\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u6076\u610f\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684 OOD \u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (MLLM) \u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u963b\u6b62\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u88ab\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u201c\u6210\u529f\u201d\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u826f\u6027\u7684\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u6216\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u7684\u6076\u610f\u76ee\u6807\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56db\u8f74\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u4e3b\u9898\u6027\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u5916 (OOD) \u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u6709\u5bb3\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u89e3 (BSD) \u7684\u9012\u5f52\u91cd\u5199\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e3b\u9898\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7ecf\u5e38\u88ab\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u963b\u6b62\uff0c\u800c\u90a3\u4e9b\u8fc7\u4e8e OOD \u7684\u63d0\u793a\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u9003\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u3002BSD \u5728 13 \u4e2a\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5f00\u6e90 MLLM \u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 67%\uff0c\u6709\u5bb3\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 21%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u7ed5\u8fc7\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u5e76\u89e6\u53d1\u5371\u9669\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u89e3 (BSD) \u7684\u9012\u5f52\u91cd\u5199\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u6076\u610f\u63d0\u793a\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684 OOD \u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f93\u5165\u66f4\u96be\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u3002BSD \u5728 13 \u4e2a\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5f00\u6e90 MLLM \u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 67%\uff0c\u6709\u5bb3\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 21%\u3002"}}

Our study\nfocuses on evaluating the accuracy of four LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and o1,\nDeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) solving three categories of math tasks, including\narithmetic, algebra, and number theory, and identifies step-level reasoning\nerrors within their solutions. Instead of relying on standard benchmarks, we\nintentionally build math tasks (via item models) that are challenging for LLMs\nand prone to errors. The accuracy of final answers and the presence of errors\nin individual solution steps were systematically analyzed and coded. Both\nsingle-agent and dual-agent configurations were tested. It is observed that the\nreasoning-enhanced OpenAI o1 model consistently achieved higher or nearly\nperfect accuracy across all three math task categories.

It is a fundamental problem in\nagent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze\nintelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the\nprimary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents\nrepresented by population members. However, when the number of attributes\ndescribing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the\njoint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of\ndimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and\nproduce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from\navailable sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute\ncombinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the\nsample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of\nfalsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in\nthe population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion\nmodel-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying\njoint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of\nnumerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros\nminimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as\nVariational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\napproaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population\nsynthesis.

Given a language instruction,\nthese models process observation and navigation history to predict the most\nappropriate action for an agent.

In this work, we propose a novel\ninput-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency.

(2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based\nadaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal\nefficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of\nviews previously seen by the agent.

While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width\nto all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic,\ninstance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior\naccuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed.\nHowever, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly\ndequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision,\nbreaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains.\nThis paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework\nthat removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer\nrepresentation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within\nhigher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only\narithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost\nbit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable\nboth dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and\ntruly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight\ncontroller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer. We demonstrate\nDQT state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 on\nImageNet. On ImageNet, our 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieves 77.00% top-1\naccuracy, an improvement over leading static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET,\n76.94%) methods at a comparable BitOPs budget. Crucially, DQT achieves this\nwith a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M simple bit-shift operations, a\ndrastic improvement over the 56.6M costly Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)\nfloating-point operations required by previous dynamic approaches - unlocking a\nnew frontier in efficient, adaptive AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "DQT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u6574\u6570\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u7eaf\u6574\u6570\u7b97\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86state-of-the-art\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u867d\u7136\u9759\u6001\u7684\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u5e94\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684bit-width\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u627f\u8bfa\u901a\u8fc7\u53ea\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728:\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u53cd\u91cf\u5316\u5230\u6d6e\u70b9\u548c\u518d\u91cf\u5316\u5230\u6574\u6570\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u7eaf\u6574\u6570\u786c\u4ef6\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3(DQT)\uff0c\u5b83\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002DQT\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5d4c\u5957\u6574\u6570\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8f83\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u503c\u4ee5bit-wise\u65b9\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u8f83\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u503c\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u7eaf\u6574\u6570\u7b97\u672f\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u901a\u8fc7\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884con-the-fly\u7684bit-width\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\uff0cDQT\u76844-bit\u52a8\u6001ResNet50\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8677.00%\u7684top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u9759\u6001(LSQ, 76.70%)\u548c\u52a8\u6001(DQNET,76.94%)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14BitOPs\u9884\u7b97\u76f8\u5f53\u3002DQT\u4ec5\u4ee528.3M\u7b80\u5355\u4f4d\u79fb\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684bit-width\u8f6c\u6362\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u768456.6M\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e58\u6cd5\u7d2f\u52a0(MAC)\u6d6e\u70b9\u8fd0\u7b97\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6709\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "DQT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u7684ResNet18\u548cImageNet\u4e0a\u7684ResNet50\u7684state-of-the-art\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u76844-bit\u52a8\u6001ResNet50\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8677.00%\u7684top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u9759\u6001(LSQ, 76.70%)\u548c\u52a8\u6001(DQNET,76.94%)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14BitOPs\u9884\u7b97\u76f8\u5f53\u3002DQT\u4ec5\u4ee528.3M\u7b80\u5355\u4f4d\u79fb\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684bit-width\u8f6c\u6362\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u768456.6M\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e58\u6cd5\u7d2f\u52a0(MAC)\u6d6e\u70b9\u8fd0\u7b97\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6709\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u2014\u2014\u5f00\u542f\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u7684\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

However, due to the high dimensionality and prevalence of zero\nelements in scRNA-seq data, traditional clustering methods face significant\nstatistical and computational challenges. While some advanced methods use graph\nneural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static\ngraph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the\nlong-tailed distribution inherent in single-cell populations.To address these\nlimitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns\nadaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance.

However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM\nsafety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although\nthere are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or\nmanipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra\ncomputation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of\nSLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during\nthe CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation\nmethod, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing\ntwo modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the\nmagnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the\nneighboring space near the initial weight distribution.

A series of defense strategies have been proposed for\nthe alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most\npost-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These\nmethods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and\nfine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and\nutility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN)\nwith Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety\nrisks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety\nlayers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety\nneurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons.

D2F equips dLLMs with two key\ncapabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache\nutilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of\nprior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs\nare refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference.\nD2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on\npre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm,\nwhich enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F\ndLLMs achieve more than $\\mathbf{2.5\\times}$ inference speed than LLaMA3 and\nQwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the\nacceleration can be more than $\\mathbf{50\\times}$ while maintaining comparable\noutput quality.

Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression\n(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from\npsychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a\nscarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.\nWhile current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative\nrepresentations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to\ncapture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective\nMER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to\nadapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt\ntuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion\nmagnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts\nfor LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into\nthe LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced\ndistinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted\non three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its\neffectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u6574\uff08MPT\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8c03\u6574LM\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884cMER\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec6\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec4\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aLM\u5728\u76ee\u6807MER\u9886\u57df\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMPT\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684MER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\uff08MER\uff09\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8eME\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86MER\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08LM\uff09\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u548c\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5230\u77ed\u6682\u548c\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u7684MER\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u6574\uff08MPT\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06LM\u7528\u4e8eMER\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3aLM\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec4\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u63d2\u5165LM\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u5728\u76ee\u6807MER\u9886\u57df\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684MER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MPT\u59cb\u7ec8\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MPT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684MER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the availability of\ntrained clinicians has not scaled proportionally, leaving many people without\nadequate or timely support. To bridge this gap, recent studies have shown the\npromise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist mental health diagnosis,\nmonitoring, and intervention. However, the development of efficient, reliable,\nand ethical AI to assist clinicians is heavily dependent on high-quality\nclinical training datasets. Despite growing interest in data curation for\ntraining clinical AI assistants, existing datasets largely remain scattered,\nunder-documented, and often inaccessible, hindering the reproducibility,\ncomparability, and generalizability of AI models developed for clinical mental\nhealth care. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey of\nclinical mental health datasets relevant to the training and development of\nAI-powered clinical assistants. We categorize these datasets by mental\ndisorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia), data modalities (e.g., text,\nspeech, physiological signals), task types (e.g., diagnosis prediction, symptom\nseverity estimation, intervention generation), accessibility (public,\nrestricted or private), and sociocultural context (e.g., language and cultural\nbackground). Along with these, we also investigate synthetic clinical mental\nhealth datasets. Our survey identifies critical gaps such as a lack of\nlongitudinal data, limited cultural and linguistic representation, inconsistent\ncollection and annotation standards, and a lack of modalities in synthetic\ndata.

In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel\nknowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned\nrepresentations from a teacher model into a student model for effective\ndevelopment of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building\nupon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi\nfoundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.\nHyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by\nintroducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel\nalignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function\ntailored for hyperspectral images.

However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which\nusually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in\nindustries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could\nonly generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the\nvideos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute\nthis limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to\ncomprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose\nsequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes\nAnimate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character\ntypes, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,\nwe introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern\nfrom the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner.

To address these, we present two key innovations.\nFirst, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically\ncombines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to\ncapture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The\nidentity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic\nexpert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves\npixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to\nmitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline\ncentered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face\nConstraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial\nregions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features\nacross temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial\nangles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this\npipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from\nexisting open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with\nannotated facial angles.

Furthermore, we embed\ndegree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing\nthe model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction\nstrengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction,\nCWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced\nloss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and\nkey residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind\nachieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a\nbalanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "CWFBind is a weighted, fast, and accurate docking method based on local curvature features that achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.", "motivation": "Accurate prediction of binding conformation is critical in rational drug design, but many deep learning-based docking methods neglect critical geometric information, resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding conformations.", "method": "CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and accurate docking method based on local curvature features.

Through controlled Online\nInterference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that\neliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements\n(AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a\nprimary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of\nexternal cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural\nlanguage as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the\nfirst semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI\nchallenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective\njudgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise\nsemantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking\nfinding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively\nexploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or\neven performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71).

Continual learning\n(CL) strategies have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, with\nreplay-based techniques demonstrating superior performance in preserving\nlearned knowledge. In this context, we introduce Gauss-Tin, a novel approach\nthat integrates the replay strategy with a Gaussian mixture model to enhance\nthe quality of sample selection during training, supplemented by instructional\nguidance to facilitate the generation of past learning. This method aims to\nimprove LLMs' retention capabilities by strategically reinforcing important\npast learnings while accommodating new information.
